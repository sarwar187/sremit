factor for heart diseas such as a high fat diet or famili histori femal hormon produc by the bodi appar help protect women against heart diseas befor age 50 when men are at their peak risk but after menopaus when hormon product ceas the rate of heart diseas in women quick climb and eventu equal the rate in men there is a lot of evid now accumul that estrogen play a role in heart diseas how it doe that is not clear judd say we would suggest that an agent that may reduc the incid of heart diseas by 50 mayb 60 in more than half the popul is worth studi this is a veri import question that need to be answer and i believ it will be estrogen appear to lower the bad cholesterol low densiti lipoprotein in the bodi and rais the good cholesterol high densiti lipoprotein to reduc the chanc of heart diseas but those possibl benefit while excit further complic a therapi that is alreadi enorm complex and the sourc of much constern among postmenopaus women and their physician estrogen and

event for mani women menopaus can trigger uncomfort symptom such as hot flash and thin of the vagin and urinari tissu the drop in hormon also caus bone thin and increas a woman risk of develop osteoporosi a condit in which bone easili break or fractur hormon replac therapi resolv mani of these problem and with the addit of possibl cardiovascular benefit it easi to see whi hormon therapi which usual consist of a mixtur of estrogen and a progesteron like chemic call progestin is prescrib for 5 to 9 million women but despit it popular the debat over hormon replac continu there are combin of reason and advantag for use estrogen say dr ezra davidson presid of the american colleg of obstetrician and gynecologist and chairman of obstetr and gynecolog at drew medic school in mani instanc physician are total those combin advantag and advis women of the benefit but there is insuffici data about the risk besid minor side effect such as menstrual bleed estrogen replac is known to promot the growth of uterin tissu call the endometrium which can lead to cancer studi show that ad progestin to the regimen remov the risk of endometri cancer so physician usual prescrib progestin for part of the month but progestin therapi open the door to a whole new set of complex side effect say barbara hulka an epidemiologist at the univers of north carolina and chairwoman of a govern advisori committe on women health issu for exampl progestin appear to eras the cardiovascular protect of estrogen and some studi show progestin increas a woman risk of breast cancer the quandari is basic the

recommend to add progestin for half the month fear that estrogen progestin therapi will increas the risk of breast cancer were elev last summer when a swedish studi reveal that women who took a combin of estrogen and progestin for more than six year were more than four time as like as other women to develop breast cancer other studi have not shown as great a risk and the signific of the swedish studi is debat judd say that data show more risk than us data judd say whether or not that will be substanti or not i dont know mani of us felt like the swedish data were over interpret but the studi did underscor the need for a better understand of the risk and benefit of hormon therapi earlier this year the food and drug administr approv new warn regard breast cancer risk on the label of estrogen therapi drug and in a more controversi move an fda advisori panel conclud in juli that estrogen taken alon without progestin help prevent heart diseas in women who have had hysterectomi becaus women who have had their uterus remov do not run the risk of endometri cancer the committe deem that estrogen alon would be benefici in this group say davidson who was a member of the panel the committe made a prudent judgment base on the inform on benefit with the understand that the inform was limit about the long term risk say davidson who ad that some committe member had reserv about

on a seri of small observ studi call epidemiolog studi not the expens clinic trial that are usual more conclus judd say i think the advisori panel recommend is prematur becaus it base exclus on epidemiolog studi he say youv got to do drug trial for someth this import that impact on everi woman in the countri weve got to spend money the pepi studi was design to fill this void judd say in the

level are measur the studi also will incorpor measur of bone densiti to learn more about the prevent of osteoporosi the pepi studi will not attempt to resolv the issu of breast cancer risk the result of the studi are expect in 1994 it remain a question of what do you do in the interim between now and the time when well have an answer petitti say do you want to take the risk of take the drug and be wrong or do your take the risk of not take the drug and be wrong i consid it to be an incred hard choic with so mani question remain physician need to review each woman circumst and fear befor

the potenti risk of breast cancer but someon has a mother or aunt who had a osteoporot bone fractur may say i dont want that to happen to me and i dont care as much about the risk of breast cancer

said bonni liebman a nutritionist for the center for scienc in the public interest in washington i dont think women who have recent undergon menopaus should say im not go to worri about calcium for

number of american age 85 and older will increas from 3 million today to 16 million by the middl of the 21st centuri congress has alloc 323 million to the nation institut on age in washington for fiscal year 1991 for new research and program on age up near 30 from 1990 the largest percentag increas in fund this year among the feder health institut there hasnt been that much fund for qualiti of life research in the last 20 year but that begin to happen now say dr edward l schneider dean of usc andrus gerontolog center the medicaid bill the health care bill are go to drive us up the wall so mayb we should start invest now in the qualiti of life shift the emphasi in research from simpli lengthen life to increas year of health is the goal of a grow number of research one reason some say is that we may be close to reach the cap on how far we can push our life span in last month scienc articl olshanski and co author bruce a carn and christin cassel use statist to show that even if the major fatal diseas were elimin life expect would not increas by much for instanc elimin all form of cancer which caus about one fifth of all death in the unit state would increas life expect at birth by onli 17 year for femal and 32 year for male current us femal born in 1989 can expect to live until age 78 6 while male can expect to reach age 71 8 i think if our goal is onli to increas life expect then i dont think were go to be veri success olshanksi say even if we go after major diseas well onli make increment gain moreov he ask even if cancer and heart diseas were elimin would the elder enjoy life if encumb by weaken bone and muscl dementia and hear loss the question is what are we replac death with he say it is possibl as cancer and heart diseas death declin as we make this progress that we may be about to trade longer life for worsen health alreadi medicin success effort to reduc death from heart diseas and some type of cancer have rais question about how to live with chronic ill olshanski say forti year ago if you have a heart attack or stroke you wouldnt live veri long he say but scienc is rampant transform those diseas into chronic problem virtual no research advoc halt research on extend life span either at the gene tinker level or among those work to cure the major fatal diseas but with limit fund avail for the studi of age set prioriti for research becom a sticki issu i dont think money should be taken away from cancer and heart diseas olshanski say those are major contributor to morbid and mortal but we think it is now time to give equal attent to the other nonfat diseas in a 13 year studi of elder peopl complet in 1981 usc gerontologist eileen m crimmin found that her subject report a wide rang of disabl mar their later year our conclus has been that the increas in life expect has been in what we call disabl year of life she say the person say they have some kind of medic condit that prevent them from lead their normal life but these appear to be condit that might not be too serious for the most part it mild disabl nevertheless becaus these condit can hamper one abil to enjoy life research are seek way to elimin them crimmin is optimist that this is possibl as the emphasi in health care move from treat diseas to prevent them studi have shown that a good diet stress reduct aerob and weight bear exercis and companionship can help the elder stave off chronic ailment and remain activ and happi i think that where much more research is be concentr delay the onset of diseas crimmin say weve just arriv at the idea that elder peopl can be rehabilit after injuri or surgeri but in set prioriti for research on age societi should not attempt to determin just what kind of life is worth extend say richard suzman a scientist at the nation institut on age i think it import to realiz that while we all have a sens of what qualiti of life mean ultim it a veri subject measur that differ across group and individu he say befor decid to fund expens scientif research he add feder health offici must weigh the potenti benefit of the research against the cost but suzman say that it would be wrong to stop pursu longer life expect base on the belief that those extra year would not be worth live becaus of pain disabl or dementia i think that one could make a bad mistak if we adopt some feder standard that defin qualiti of life",

of the inform will come not from dialogu but through video we have prepar sever report that we are confid will give our viewer a comprehens idea of the practic applic of nuclear technolog in the cuban economi princip develop sector open agenda will includ exclus statement by the director of the radiat health and safeti center as well as by sean execut secretari engin andr garcia a rather import part of tonight program we wish to begin with a report by cienfuego correspond omar georg passag omit resillez salazar the sean give particular attent to the complet of the isotop product center i recal that on last tuesday program we talk about isotop and their characterist i would like you to explain the import of this center salazar the isotop product center is go to be the largest and most complex nuclear technolog facil and is extrem import for econom as well as strateg reason at it temporari facil at quinta and 30th street three radiopharmaceut product are manufactur but there are certain product that cannot be made there the new facil will make produc more product a realiti it will also allow us to increas the volum of these product in a short period we will be abl to produc 25 item at the temporari facil we can produc onli three item by 1995 we expect this increas product to save cuba approxim 1 million henc it econom import in strateg term this increas in product will allow us to increas the applic of nuclear technolog nationwid and reduc our foreign depend moreov this work of produc receiv and handl the isotop in a central manner will increas safeti in this area this new center will thus be of tremend import to the countri resillez thank you engin we are now go to run a video that will confirm and perhap increas understand of this center and will also show the current stage of construct of this isotop product center here in havana begin video record by unidentifi report among the prioriti of cuba nuclear program is a modern isotop center that is be built in the vicin of pedro pi in the eastern part of havana conceiv as a product research and develop unit this center seek to extend nuclear techniqu to medicin and industri it basic object is to organ recept and qualiti control distribut the primari radioisotop and produc whatev is need in cuba this center intend to carri out a number of task among them product of radiopharmaceut product and tracer compound compuesto marcado essenti for medic diagnos and therapi the tracer compound are practic irreplac instrument in develop new medicin a program the countri is implement the requir for regist and market these medicin includ complex pharmacokinet studi mani of which are possibl onli when the molecul are mark with radioact isotop that allow them to be follow through the live organ trace their bodi accumul and excret process as well as other characterist a group of radiochemist from this center are in charg of do the radioact mark of this new medicin known as ppg this has allow a save of 17 000 and abov all protect of the formula which should be reveal to the foreign compani in charg of the mark becaus of it product capac and characterist the new plant which employ argentin technolog will be the largest facil in cuba to handl radioact materi consequ sean has paid special attent to the work in order to guarante it safeti from the veri begin end record resillez probabl veri few peopl are awar that nuclear technolog is employ in vital area of the countri econom and product sphere some may be awar of this but for mani it will come as a surpris when i say vital area of the countri econom develop i am refer for instanc to the sugar agroindustri nonsugarcan agricultur the nickel industri biotechnolog and other which could includ explor for and extract of cuban crude oil in all these line of develop nuclear technolog is use i think the best way to convey this to our viewer is through the follow report begin video record of unidentifi correspond the use of nuclear technolog in various sphere of nation life is one of the main object of cuba nuclear program which receiv a special thrust in the 1980s the area in which these techniqu are use includ agricultur the sugar industri and iron and steel product as well as geolog explor for oil and miner cuban agricultur has especi benefit from the use of nuclear techniqu through the use of ioniz radiat an import phytotechn program of mutat has allow us to obtain a varieti of new plant of great econom import an acceler program use the techniqu that leav plant insect free has been implement to control pest that affect sever crop the most import result achiev have been with the borer that attack sugarcan radioact tracer and nuclear analyt techniqu in the sugar agroindustri have allow us to evalu the oper of our instal and learn about the chemic composit of the product and by product obtain the use of radioisotop instrument has develop great over the past few year the iron and steel and mechan industri must be highlight factori in these industri use monitor system base on this type of equip this product line is current be strengthen with the possibl of develop and produc equip for these purpos in cuba an exampl of this is the nickel industri humid measur system base on the method of reflect neutron that was design and manufactur in cuba this system give us a tremend save in fuel the other area in which nuclear techniqu are use is petroleum research determin the point of interphas between water and oil and establish the caus of failur in well under exploit are two of the object of the use of radioisotop techniqu in which foreign compani current oper in cuba have express interest end record resillez engin salazar befor go on to discuss the use of these practic techniqu i think our viewer might be interest in learn whether our nuclear develop program is maintain fluent intern relat or is at all isol salazar it maintain good relat intern word indistinct to show that our program is consist and on the right path we have bilater relat with approxim 15 countri and multilater relat through the assist and cooper system of the intern atom energi agenc iaea of which we are a member proof of this is that we have been elect to the board of governor by latin america for a fourth time this will give you an idea of the prestig we have achiev and of our current relat in this regard we have receiv support from the iaea for the period 1993 94 in support of the work we have been develop in cuba involv the use of nuclear techniqu this support amount to 12 million and has been provid to cuba in equip train and advis this cooper increas to 8 million over the past two as heard year and includ a food irradi plant a gamma chamber modern nuclear medicin equip modern equip for other

the nation the cuban nuclear program through sean suppli the entir countri over 56 percent of those resourc is in other organ such as the ministri of agricultur the public health ministri et cetera resillez thank you engin i see engin salazar refer to the health program and the presenc of nuclear techniqu in the health system as opportun i am almost convinc that this is noth new for our viewer but let us see what happen with the practic use of nuclear techniqu in the health system and in biotechnolog begin video record of unidentifi correspond nuclear scienc and technolog are becom increas more import in the health program in biotechnolog and in the pharmaceut industri diagnost method with the use of radiopharmaceut instrument are indispens to the public health system among the radioisotop techniqu we can mention is the gammagraph techniqu broad use in neurolog cardiolog oncolog renal and other studi cuba has a total of eight gamma camera instal in nuclear medic servic nationwid in which profession and expert in nuclear matter are work nation consumpt of radioisotop and tracer compound has increas to more than 1 million annual over the past five year although this cost has drop over the past few year thank to a group of radiochemist from the sean who have produc three tracer compound use in renal bone and brain studi this has allow a save of more than 100 000 annual the radiosteril system has allow the decontamin and steril of bioprepar plastic materi and of medic pharmaceut product the tracer compound are in great demand in the genet engin and pharmaceut industri they facilit the demand for studi of new pharmaceut product befor their registr the task of the cuban nuclear expert has also been extend to produc a small quantiti of medic equip this equip which is produc in the countri are of high qualiti and veri competit an exampl of this is the dego bone densiti measur for the diagnosi and treatment of problem in bone metabol and in osteoporosi it oper through a nuclear method call photon absorpt this is veri import for the studi of bone metabol implement by the public health ministri end record salazar resillez with the opportun present by this video i would like to mention a few thing the video say that we have eight gamma camera in the countri i would like to add that nationwid today we have 17 nuclear medicin modul this show the high level diagnos that can be made of given diseas anywher in the countri the video also mention the product of some medic equip we alreadi discuss in the previous program as you can see the qualiti achiev is outstand and not onli for this show this has been confirm by our own medic personnel who are use this equip although they are still face a medic registr process resillez thank you engin the use of all these nuclear techniqu not onli in cuba but in ani countri in the world demand veri profession work and sever safeti measur to prevent damag to peopl or the environ in cuba of cours we are do this in the follow video we are go to see what is happen in this field then we are go to listen to dr lui jova who is head of the center for radiat protect and control centro de proteccion e higien de las radiacion cphr we therefor consid this video and these exclus comment for open agenda of great import to nation public opinion begin video record by unidentifi correspond sinc it found in 1985 the cphr has been the coordin and lead guid for radiolog activ in cuba togeth with the territori deleg to the sean it control the radiat dosag receiv by each worker profession link to ioniz radiat in the 192 radiat institut oper in the countri one of the most relev activ carri out by this center is the research entitl environment radiolog studi carri out in cuba between 1984 and 1992 award by the cuban academi of scienc the radiat control task includ studi and control of the local and region influenc that man has on the environ of nuclear and radiat instal and the influenc of overal radioact discharg the data releas by the nation network is repres of the whole countri for their studi zone of econom interest have been priorit such as juragua in cienfuego and those of interest to tourism such as the northern coast of the provinc of ciego de avila camaguey and las tuna one of the conclus of the radiat studi is that the radioact to which current and futur visitor could be expos in a tourist zone as import as cayo coco cayo guillermo cayo paredon or cayo sabin and the beach of santa lucia covarrubia or por ella is much less than the averag level throughout the world cuba is a territori with a normal radioact background it is a place with radiolog condit favor to the develop of ani human activ in general as well as be a magnific place for those peopl who in addit to the beauti of the area enjoy the environment cleanli the cphr has demonstr this with solid scientif argument end record begin jova record in fact in addit to what you just saw we can add that our center as a center in charg of all scientif and technic servic in the area of radiolog safeti has particip passag indistinct treatment of children from the area affect by the chernobyl accid our expert have been charg with make a review and evalu the amount of radiat these children receiv other studi have been develop in the field of radiolog in 1986 our center was also given the mission of collect all radioact sourc no longer in use in the countri and to confin them safe in quarter own by the sean and special design and built for that purpos we were also charg with collect all radioact wast generat by institut user of these sourc these wast were also treat and are safe kept thank to technolog design by expert from our institut and our countri as you were abl to see in that video our center has an import respons concern environment radiat control this link to servic render in the radiat protect area by worker who are profession expos to radiat guarante radiat protect of the peopl of worker who are expos becaus of the work they do and of the environ throughout the countri end record resillez cuba has been work on it nuclear program for almost 20 year prepar product and train have been the essenti pillar of this complex project which as you have seen through these two consecut program on open agenda the countri can alreadi wit the result it has achiev a few hour ago we had a long chat with engin andr garcia execut secretari of the nation atom energi commiss as we said in the begin we attribut great import to this convers especi regard inform for nation and intern public opinion we have taken one segment of that dialogu which basic discuss the prospect of the cuban nuclear program with that we wish to conclud these two program devot to this issu but not befor express our gratitud to the sean and it inform center for all the support they have provid us for this program i would also like to thank engin salazar and you viewer for tune in to this open agenda program begin garcia record first i would like to thank everyon involv in this program and especi you resillez for this opportun you are give us to inform our peopl through this program about the cuban nuclear program those video have demonstr that our nuclear program is in good health concern futur prospect we are make effort to begin the nuclear energi program thus in the develop of increas more complex instal we have begun with the principl of use our own effort in this case the scientif potenti creat by the revolut in this scientif technic structur apropo to this idea i wish to say that our develop must be essenti base on the capac creat by the countri to design and build complex instal in this field we thus consid it a prioriti to keep our expert unit and especi to keep them develop their knowledg in the scientif technic field the world must think more and more about how to solv futur energi problem it is not onli cuba face this energi crisi today man must think about how to solv this problem in the futur in this regard nuclear energi play an import role and great effort are be made today to develop sophist reactor fast breed reactor and nuclear fusion which have greater potenti than the current method what we have been do so far is a way of keep ourselv up to date on possibl for begin a much more complex energi generat system in the near futur howev if we abandon this idea the potenti creat over the year by the revolut would be dispers i think we the men work in this field have an oblig to be realist and sensit to the countri situat confront task that have to do with current time but we must also have a view of the futur and work on this view this is the way we think at the sean and i think i can say to sum up this idea we must be abl to daydream i think our command in chief in his histor alleg and histori will support me be a young lawyer was abl to have a futur view of nuclear energi in his alleg then he was alreadi refer to the import of nuclear energi to solv the countri econom problem imagin in 1953 we were a year short of oper the first nuclear power plant in the world end record", "score": -8.403230818806223, "doc_id": "FBIS4-10326",

claim author for use on food in convent food form it is import to establish that the supplement provid the same health protect benefit as the convent food fda disagre with the assert in the comment that it has been unfair with the dietari supplement industri with respect to it approv of specif health claim fda believ that the health claim should be consist with the scientif evid avail to the agenc in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2537 2552 and 2622 fda explain whi it was author health claim pertain to 1 heart diseas and diet low in satur fat and cholesterol and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber 2 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber and 3 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that may contain fiber vitamin a beta caroten and vitamin c the agenc also explain in detail whi it was not author health claim pertain to ani specif nutrient ie heart diseas and dietari fiber cancer and dietari fiber and cancer and antioxid vitamin in the case of the antioxid vitamin fda found that although there was suffici evid to justifi a health claim concern the relationship between diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that may contain fiber vitamin a and vitamin c and a reduc risk of cancer the avail evid did not provid a basi on which to attribut the reduct in risk of diseas to ani individu vitamin or combin of vitamin regardless of whether the vitamin is classifi as an antioxid or not see discuss under section iv 58 fr 2622 at 2633 yet becaus of the use of vitamin a as beta caroten and c and dietari fiber in identifi those fruit and veget that correl with reduc cancer risk fda identifi these nutrient as be characterist of the food associ with a protect effect ani one or a combin of these three nutrient can serv as the identifi marker moreov becaus fruit and veget are also character by an absenc of fat and becaus of the identifi relationship of low fat diet to reduc risk of cancer fda highlight low fat intak as part of the dietari pattern associ with decreas cancer risk becaus the mechan of the protect effect of fruit and veget is not known and becaus it is not possibl to determin which of the nutrient or other compon in fruit and veget is caus the observ effect the health claim author by fda focus on fruit and veget as a class of food and their relationship to cancer risk and not on particular nutrient by requir that all character nutrient be identifi as characterist of dietari pattern rich in fruit and veget without specif attribut reduc cancer risk to a singl nutrient or singl type of nutrient antioxid vitamin fda made the claim consist with the scientif knowledg avail to it at the time it author the claim becaus of the rapid evolv scienc base relat to this topic howev fda has continu to updat it evalu of the scientif evid and the degre of scientif agreement on the relationship between antioxid vitamin and cancer as part of these effort fda initi along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public confer on antioxid vitamin and cancer and cardiovascular diseas that was held on novemb 1 through 3 1993 the transcript of that meet has been submit to the docket as a comment on the antioxid vitamin and cancer rulemak along with other comment receiv in respons to the announc of the confer 58 fr 54595 octob 22 1993 fda is review the result of this confer and other scientif evid that has becom public avail sinc the public of the januari 6 1993 final rule on antioxid vitamin and cancer similar in the case of heart diseas and dietari fiber and of cancer and dietari fiber the agenc found that there was insuffici evid to attribut the reduct in risk specif to dietari fiber or to specif fiber compon the agenc did conclud howev that dietari fiber and solubl fiber along with other nutrient serv as use marker in identifi those food for which the scientif evid show that inclus in a daili diet was associ with reduc risk of cancer and of heart diseas 58 fr 2552 and 58 fr 2537 for both topic area the agenc also note the inabl of common use analyt methodolog to detect mani of the characterist that vari among dietari fiber and that may be relat to biolog function eg particl size chemic composit water hold capac with regard to heart diseas other compon variabl associ with solubl fiber in food eg lipid compon may also contribut to a cholesterol lower effect fda found that the inabl to detect mani of the differ among fiber fiber compon and other substanc in food that contain dietari fiber includ solubl fiber and the general lack of conclus as to the mechan of action of dietari fiber and fiber compon were limit factor on fdas abil to draw conclus from the avail evid furthermor fda note that food high in dietari fiber are also general low in calori and total fat factor that are associ with reduc risk of cancer fiber rich food are also general low in satur fat and cholesterol substanc that also affect the risk of develop heart diseas thus some or all of the benefit associ with diet high in fiber rich food could be the result of displac of fat and satur fat from the total diet rather than an effect of fiber per se the agenc state that although the specif role of the numer potenti protect substanc or displac of negat substanc eg fat satur fat and cholesterol in such plant food are not yet understood popul with diet rich in these food experi mani health advantag includ lower rate of heart diseas and cancer thus fda did not author the use of a health claim on the associ between ingest of dietari fiber or specif fiber compon and a reduc risk of heart diseas or cancer instead for cancer fda to be consist with the avail scientif evid and prevail scientif agreement focus on fiber contain grain product fruit and veget as product class similar for heart diseas fda focus on fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber particular solubl fiber becaus of the use of dietari fiber or solubl fiber in identifi the type of food whose consumpt is most like to correl with decreas cancer or heart diseas risk these substanc can serv as identifi marker for select use food even in the absenc of adequ evid of a direct effect of fiber fda is awar howev of the rapid evolv natur of the scienc base relat to these topic area fda intend to updat it review of the scienc by initi in the near futur along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public symposium on dietari fiber and heart diseas and cancer with respect to assert concern folic acid fda disagre that it should have allow health claim on dietari supplement while prohibit their use on food in convent food form while fda did not author a health claim for folic acid and ntds in the final rule on heath claim and label statement for folic acid and ntds publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2606 hereinaft refer to as the folic acid final rule the agenc did announc it plan to work expediti to author a claim if appropri the agenc note that the public health servic phs includ fda had recommend ref 7 that all women of childbear age in the unit state should consum 04 milligram mg 400 microgram g of folic acid daili to reduc their risk of have a pregnanc affect with spina bifida or other neural tube defect fda acknowledg that this recommend evidenc that signific scientif agreement exist regard a relationship between folat and ntds but said that there were factor that prevent fda from author a claim the agenc said that the act must be read as a whole and that section 403 r 3 a ii and 409 of the act 21 usc 348 reflect the proposit that the use of a substanc that is the subject of a health claim must be safe the agenc point out that the phs recommend state that there were signific question that persist about the safe use of folic acid in food as state in the folic acid final rule fda expect that the author of a claim would like result in signific increas in consumpt of folic acid by women in their childbear year and by the general popul becaus manufactur would add folic acid to their product in order to claim that these product were use in reduc the risk of birth defect intak of multipl dose of folic acid from supplement and from it increas presenc in the food suppli could rapid result in intak of 3 to 7 mg 3 000 to 7 000 g per day 58 fr 2606 at 2614 such intak repres increas of 10 fold or more abov current intak in the folic acid final rule the agenc review the safeti consider rais by such increas in folic acid intak includ 1 potenti effect in person with poor vitamin b12 status 2 potenti risk for person take medic that interfer with folat metabol 3 potenti risk for pregnant women becaus of uncertainti about effect of high blood level of folic acid on the embryo dure gestat and 4 uncertainti regard possibl interact between folic acid and other nutrient with increas folic acid intak the agenc conclud that it could not author a health claim on folic acid until the question regard the safe use of this nutrient were satisfactorili resolv in the folic acid final rule the agenc describ the effort it was undertak to address and resolv these concern follow public of this document base on it review of the evid it discuss with an advisori committe and it review of the comment that it receiv the agenc tentat conclud that the safeti problem rais by folic acid can be resolv by set a safe upper limit of intak of 1 mg folat per day for all popul group the agenc announc it tentat conclus in a propos to author a health claim on folat and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 octob 14 1993 in companion document fda also propos to amend the food addit regul for folic acid to specifi the food that could be fortifi with folic acid and the level at which they could be fortifi 58 fr 53312 and to amend the standard of ident for specif cereal grain product to permit the addit of folic acid 58 fr 53305 thus base on this review of the agenc action it is clear that the nondiscriminatori provis suggest in the comment is not necessari when fda has conclud that a substanc has a relationship to a diseas fda has act to author a claim see final rule on calcium and osteoporosi 58 fr 2665 and the propos rule on folic acid and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 in the case of antioxid vitamin and cancer dietari fiber and heart diseas and dietari fiber and cancer the evid did not establish that the name substanc had an effect on the name diseas the evid show that these nutrient were mere marker of food that had been shown in studi to affect the risk of the diseas fda has reflect the scientif evid in the claim that it has author and propos to author ani other cours of action would be inconsist with the act becaus it would result in claim that were both not scientif valid and mislead b altern approach in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 fda advis that a varieti of approach had come to fdas attent about how health claim for dietari supplement would best be regul under the 1990 amend these approach came to the agenc attent by various mean includ the comment on the health claim propos that address the most appropri method for regul dietari supplement testimoni befor congress about implement of the 1990 amend as well as the legisl histori of the 1990 amend fda care evalu each of these approach to determin how they compar with the characterist that fda has list abov a number of comment address the agenc tentat conclus about these approach 1 use of advisori committe in the dietari supplement health claim propos see section ii 1 58 fr 33700 at 33704 fda advis that it had tentat decid not to adopt a committe base approach suggest in comment for evalu the valid of health claim on herb this approach known as the botan ingredi review bir would involv the establish of expert panel under the direct of an oversight committe fda would particip as a nonvot member of the expert panel the oversight committe which would be charg with the respons of review all health claim petit pertain to herb or botan compon would reliev fda of all respons for initi review of these petit each expert panel would conduct an evalu of scientif data pertain to the request claim subject the evalu to peer review and prepar a final recommend about the claim the recommend and all support document would then be forward to fda and the agenc would be permit 120 day to approv disapprov or modifi the report under draft regul prepar and submit for fda adopt by one comment on the health claim propos there would be a codifi presumpt in favor of the committe recommend the agenc base it tentat decis about the bir on it belief that the suggest approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author on health claim becaus of this presumpt in the draft regul submit by the comment under this presumpt fda would be oblig to prove that the committe was wrong if the agenc decid not to follow the committe recommend in such circumst fda could be forc to propos to author health claim that it was not satisfi were scientif valid fda note that there is no basi under the act for such a transfer also the agenc note that the creation of such a committe would be financi burdensom and state that it would be inappropri to commit it limit resourc to a committe with as narrow a scope as that suggest by the comment 3 a few comment address this advisori committe issu some comment voic opposit to fdas tentat decis not to establish a bir these comment disput the agenc assert that the establish of a bir would involv ani transfer of author note that fda would retain full and final discret in approv health claim the comment also disput fdas find that the creation of a bir would be burdensom and cost in light of the agenc limit resourc the comment state that such a find is inconsist with fdas current use of advisori committe for veri narrow subject matter such as over the counter otc antiplaqu product circulatori system medic devic and drug abus the comment state that the use of a bir to help screen petit from the much larger herbal product industri would be an effici econom and scientif credibl way to ration fdas scarc resourc and would also help fda meet statutorili impos deadlin for action on petit that it might not otherwis be abl to meet the comment also assert that the agenc statement that it has the ultim respons to determin whether the petit for health claim is valid impli a mistrust of the integr of the bir process and the involv scientist and reveal an agenc belief that it is the onli author compet to judg the scientif valid of health claim for herbal dietari supplement the comment disagre with such a conclus and argu that health claim petit will onli receiv adequ and full consider from the scientif communiti best qualifi to determin whether they meet the signific scientif agreement standard set by congress through the creation of a bir which would repres the most compet and knowledg bodi in a field that remain larg esoter to fda one of these comment suggest that appropri select for herbal expert panel might includ experienc herbal practition who are familiar with potenti advers reaction to herb as well as medic practition in foreign countri where herb safeti has been studi by govern and industri panel the comment state that the inclus of foreign medic practition would be especi appropri dure the evalu of a claim whose merit are agre upon throughout the world but are not general recogn in the unit state such as in the case of use peppermint tea for it sooth or carmin effect on the digest tract howev one comment support the agenc tentat decis not to adopt the bir process the comment state that fda could well be legal liabl for decis made by the bir that were later shown to have place the public health at risk sever comment call for fda to establish an advisori committe for health claim for dietari supplement where the committe would select expert panel respons for the evalu of propos health claim for all dietari supplement the comment suggest that the expert panel should be compos of scientist and health care profession with expertis on a given nutrient diseas relationship as well as nonvot industri and consum repres these comment contend that one reason for the agenc slow in approv a health claim for folic acid has been it relianc on advisori panel that were not suffici familiar with the research in the area and who had to be educ about the strength of the evid befor they could act some of these comment suggest that fda could retain the author to reject the recommend of the committe as long as it publish it reason for do so anoth comment state that both the dietari supplement industri and fda have been slow to recogn and util a great deal of research that has been done in the area of nutrit and health the comment attribut this slow to a gap between the scientif communiti fda and the dietari supplement industri the comment suggest that in order to close this gap fda should form a committe of it lead scientist to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month or as requir to discuss the latest research in the area of nutrit and health publish in high accredit scientif journal so that the research could be use to creat and support health claim petit the comment suggest that when the agenc committe and the industri reach an agreement on the data fda could author the use of a health claim on the nutrient diseas relationship on which there is agreement fda recogn that advisori committe may make valuabl contribut in assist the agenc to evalu scientif evid about health claim in certain circumst for exampl the folic acid subcommitte of the food advisori committe provid valuabl recommend in support of fda propos to author a health claim for folic acid and propos to fortifi cereal grain product the agenc intend to continu it use of advisori committe wherev the need aris fda believ howev that it should retain the right to decid when the use of an advisori committe is necessari there may frequent be circumst in which evid establish that use of advisori committe is not necessari becaus the evid show that the claim is clear support or clear not support in addit if the agenc were to establish a stand advisori committe for health claim fda would want it to have a broader focus than just dietari supplement fdas view is that claim should focus on the substanc and not the food in which it is found becaus the primari issu is whether the substanc diseas relationship has been establish thus if fda were to establish a stand advisori committe it would be on health claim in general although a number of comment assert that fda lack knowledg of herbal product the agenc believ that it personnel are fulli compet to evalu proper substanti petit concern health claim in this area also if the agenc were to decid to establish an advisori committe it would take step to ensur that the membership of the committe had the necessari expertis includ pertin expertis on herbal product there is an implic in some of the comment that the evalu of the scientif evid support a claim is somehow differ depend on the substanc involv in fact whether a claim is for a vitamin miner herb or other similar nutrit substanc includ fat satur fat and cholesterol the skill need for evalu of a claim are basic the same these skill are found in epidemiologist nutritionist biostatistician clinician and expert in the diseas be address as well as in peopl awar of how the substanc is or should be consum thus fda doe not agre with the implic in these comment fda is interest in have communic with the dietari supplement industri howev the agenc doe not believ that it would be appropri for the communic to take the form of the suggest stand committe to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month while fda believ that regular communic with the dietari supplement industri is like to be use the process by which health claim are author must be a more open and public process than that suggest by the comment certain the 1990 amend envis a public process for claim for substanc in food in convent food form as reflect in section 403 r 4 of the act fda has been present with no convinc reason whi a similar process should not appli to claim for substanc in dietari supplement furthermor fda continu to believ that the bir advisori committe approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author for health claim even though comment on the health claim propos and the dietari supplement health claim propos have made argument to the contrari the suggest regul for health claim that was submit to fda on may 10 1991 and refer to by the agenc in the propos that it has issu state in part b if the committe determin that a propos health claim is appropri for a particular herb or botan either as propos or as modifi by the committe it shall forward it recommend s to fda togeth with all the data and other inform befor the committe when it made it decis c if the committe determin that on the basi of the data and other inform befor it the propos health claim is not scientif justifi for the herb or botan it shall so notifi the propos the propos may then direct the committe to forward to fda all the inform befor the committe with respect to the propos togeth with it conclus and the reason therefor d within 120 day of receipt of the inform describ in b and c abov fda shall either accept the recommend reject it or modifi it base upon the agenc independ evalu with analysi and reason for reject or modif of recommend health claim in arriv at it decis fda may consid data or inform other than that befor the committe there shall be a presumpt to be sustain when the record is view as a whole in favor of a committe recommend under either b or c emphasi ad despit assert to the contrari the last sentenc of paragraph d oblig fda to establish that the committe was wrong in order not to follow the committe recommend ultim therefor there would in fact be a signific transfer of author if the suggest provis were to be adopt by fda as fda note in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33704 there is no basi under the act for such a transfer of author fda doe not question that expert on an industri committe or panel on herb and botan could be help the agenc encourag firm to work through such group for this reason fda revis the provis pertain to petit in the health claim final rule to clarifi that the agenc will consid all recommend by such committe and panel see 101 70 b fda recogn that those petit that have undergon an independ scientif review and receiv endors by qualifi expert group will like be well support petit and could be veri persuas to fda further fda is like to place consider weight on the recommend of outsid expert and it decis as to whether a petit should be grant could be influenc signific by these expert although fda encourag firm to work through group of outsid expert the agenc would be concern if such group were heavili weight with medic practition as one of the comment suggest over relianc on such practition to the exclus of scientist repres other relev scientif descript impli that the herb are to be use for medicin purpos fda stress again that health claim are about the relationship of food rather than drug to a diseas or health relat condit 2 establish of an approach base on a more lenient or the same standard fda propos to subject dietari supplement to the same scientif standard and procedur that the statut provid for food in convent food form section 403 r 3 b i of the act the standard codifi in 101 14 c state c valid requir fda will promulg regul author a health claim onli when it determin base on the total of public avail scientif evid includ evid from well design studi conduct in a manner which is consist with general recogn scientif procedur and principl that there is signific scientif agreement among expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu such claim that the claim is support by such evid fda explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that it know of no standard and procedur for dietari supplement that would both be more lenient than the standard and procedur for food in convent food form and yet still have the characterist that fda consid necessari under the 1990 amend and their legisl histori the agenc state that it had tentat conclud that a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act 21 usc 343 a 1 or that allow health claim base on the exist of substanti scientif evid even though signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim doe not exist would be inconsist with congresss desir to ensur that health claim that are made on food includ dietari supplement are scientif valid fda said that it was concern that if it were to allow claim in the marketplac whose valid had not been establish these claim would undercut the credibl of those health claim that are in fact valid the agenc said that if it were to allow such claim consum would be left littl better off and no less confus than they were in 1989 befor the passag of the 1990 amend fda also express it tentat view that the propos approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other 58 fr 33700 at 33706 4 a larg number of comment assert that fda should establish an approach base on a more lenient standard for dietari supplement some of these comment argu that such an approach is direct by congress and cite a statement of senat hatch one of the primari author of the 1990 amend that a more lenient standard for dietari supplement s is envis one comment argu that by provid for the establish of a separ standard for dietari supplement congress had implicit reject the rigid standard of signific scientif agreement adopt for food in convent food form the comment assert that fda was therefor bound by basic tenet of statutori construct to adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement as such an action would give mean to congresss instruct wherea the adopt of the propos standard would in effect render those instruct meaningless the comment note that court have tradit not interpret provis of a statut in way that would render other provis superflu a number of comment state that use the same standard and procedur for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form is counter to the intent of the 1990 amend becaus congress intend to make more rather than less inform about the health benefit of dietari supplement avail to consum the comment assert that health inform about the effect of diet on diseas is particular import to consum of dietari supplement in decid which product to buy sever comment argu that restrict this inform on dietari supplement will deni million of american the inform that they need to improv their health and to help reduc their risk of dead afflict such as heart diseas and cancer the comment assert that such restrict will cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been save through diseas prevent some comment express concern that restrict the use of proper qualifi health claim base on preliminari evid would encourag inform hungri consum to seek inform about the health benefit of various dietari supplement from sourc such as book and the media which may be unreli and which are not regul by fda these comment argu that adopt a polici that result in consum turn to inform that may well be mislead or outright fals is contrari to the educ goal of the 1990 amend one comment stress that fda should assist consum by encourag them to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet lifestyl and other factor comment suggest that fda should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin all possibl for consum misunderstand or all element of risk associ with increas consumpt of dietari supplement a few of these comment advis that a more lenient standard would be appropri for dietari supplement becaus they are be sold to educ consum rather than to the general popul some of these comment disput the argument that consum could be misl by a more lenient standard these comment note that consum continu to reli on health messag on product such as cigarett and condom despit the fact that the messag have chang over the year in respons to new scientif find other comment state that studi have indic that consum are abl to use various advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner sever comment assert that fda should allow the use of preliminari health claim on dietari supplement and food in convent food form becaus it allow their use on drug the comment state that fdas propos revis of the pediatr use subsect of prescript drug label in the feder regist of octob 16 1992 57 fr 47423 would allow prescript drug that had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children to nevertheless be given to children provid that the drug efficaci claim were qualifi by the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish the comment state that becaus these drug had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children their claim would be preliminari at best and misbrand at worst howev mani comment argu against a more lenient standard and procedur for dietari supplement sever comment stress that the adopt of the propos standard and procedur is support by the legisl histori of the 1990 amend and the ds act one of these comment maintain that while the 1990 amend give fda the option of adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the congression record denot a major opinion in favor of fda appli the same standard to supplement that the act provid for convent food a number of comment also warn fda that hold dietari supplement and food in convent food form to differ standard for health claim would lead to consum confus as the health benefit of nutrient deriv from dietari supplement would be allow to be character as superior to the benefit of those same nutrient deriv from food in convent food form some comment assert that the creation of public confus would direct undermin the intent of the 1990 amend to clear up consum confus about health claim inform and would jeopard consum confid in exist health claim food label and the govern particular public health offici anoth comment assert that adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement could also allow some supplement manufactur to make unsubstanti claim and undercut consum belief in the credibl of the entir supplement industri these comment assert that a singl univers standard would best prevent consum confus by ensur that health claim inform is uniform on all food sever comment support the same standard and procedur on the ground that it would ensur that health claim appear on the label of dietari supplement are base on reliabl peer review reproduc evid a number of these comment state that becaus supplement unlik convent food are taken specif for the health benefit associ with them it is especi import that health claim on these product be reliabl becaus more and more consum are use these product in the belief that the product will protect their health the comment said that these consum were respond to the larg amount of recent evid indic that vitamin miner and other nutrient may play a role in reduc the risk of chronic diseas some comment caution fda that the failur to ensur that health claim on dietari supplement are reliabl would leav consum open to fraud a few of these comment point out that mani consum do not have the scientif knowledg to judg the verac of label claim for themselv and presum that fda regul ensur that label claim are proper substanti one of these comment warn that older american are especi vulner to fraud this comment point out that the elder suffer disproport from diet relat diseas read supplement label more often than other peopl are more trust of salesperson and do less research than younger consum other comment warn that unsubstanti health claim can harm consum by induc them to consum product that are inher unsaf to consum excess dose of some substanc or to forego more benefici form of treatment for a given maladi a number of comment insist that the propos regul will not restrict the flow of inform on nutrit and health to consum one of these comment state that rough 80 percent of supplement label are alreadi in complianc with the propos regul other comment note that educ materi are not cover by the propos regul and that there are mani avail channel through which inform can be freeli dissemin other than food label moreov one comment contend that supplement label are neither intend nor current use to educ the public but instead serv to sell the product to which they are attach some comment state that appli the same standard to both convent food and dietari supplement would creat a desir level play field for all food processor and manufactur one comment state the adopt of the propos standard will provid an atmospher in which all food manufactur can move toward the product of healthier food which will benefit the public health in fdas reconsider of how best to regul dietari supplement one of the most signific issu has been the issu of whether supplement should be regul under a more lenient standard or the same scientif standard as that establish by congress for food in convent food form despit assert by some that congress direct that a more lenient standard be establish the legisl histori of the 1990 amend doe not support such a posit to the contrari as other comment point out and as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim propos 56 fr 60537 at 60539 through 60540 the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2507 through 2509 and the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 congress did not intend that the agenc be forc to adopt a differ standard for dietari supplement instead congress gave the agenc the discret to adopt ani appropri scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement there was noth in the comment that indic that fda doe not have this discret inde as some of the comment point out there was consider support in both the hous of repres and the senat for adopt of the same scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement fda address the posit of member of congress on this issu in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33703 senat hatch left no question about his posit that fda should use this flexibl to adopt the standard and procedur for dietari supplement that appear appropri to the agenc to adopt a more lenient standard howev other member of congress were equal clear about their posit that fda should not adopt a more lenient standard in the octob 24 1990 congression record at s 16608 ref 4 senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state it is my view that there is no reason to do anyth other than util the same procedur and standard for dietari supplement whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud further the hous of repres clear did not support a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the statement of hous floor manag that appear in the octob 26 1990 congression record at h 12953 ref 2 state whatev approach the agenc take it must adopt a system that evalu the valid of ani diseas claim made with respect to these substanc it system must be base on consider of public health and consum fraud as in everi similar decis made by the agenc today we fulli expect that the agenc evalu of diseas claim made with respect to vitamin will be base on sound scientif principl there is a great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim the potenti is just as great for vitamin as it is for other product in our view vitamin and other substanc cover by this provis should be subject to at least as strong a standard as is applic to other food that contain claim that the food will treat a diseas or health condit noth in the ds act or it legisl histori indic in ani way that congress chang it posit about it goal of the 1990 amend with respect to prohibit mislead health claim and improv of the public health through use of valid and understand claim in food label ref 3 although congress left no question that the exact standard and procedur for the regul of health claim for dietari supplement is left to the discret of fda and although congress did not provid direct guidanc concern how fda should use this discret congress did provid consider general guidanc about the intent of the health claim provis of the 1990 amend in view of the fact that this guidanc doe not distinguish between dietari supplement and food in convent food form fda consid this guidanc to be applic to both type of food as point out abov in this respons senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state that whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement he stress that the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 4 the quot statement of the hous floor manag also stress that the agenc approach to regul dietari supplement must be base on consider of public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 2 in addit these quot statement make it clear that congress consid the use of inaccur or unsupport health claim on food label to be harm to the public ref 2 moreov mr waxman one of the hous floor manag state the follow in the juli 30 1990 congression record h5844 what we have sought to do is to permit health claim but onli health claim base on scientif valid inform and we hope by have that scientif valid inform upon which a claim can be made that health claim in the futur will be health and not mislead furthermor as the agenc point out in the januari 6 1993 feder regist 58 fr 2478 at 2526 by enact the 1990 amend congress sought to ensur that health claim would be scientif valid and not mislead see for exampl statement of rep madigan and statement of rep waxman ref 2 experi had shown that mani unfound health claim were be use on food statement of rep waxman ref 2 congress recogn the great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim id statement of hous floor manag in respons to the high potenti for health claim to be mislead congress legisl that ani claim that is not consist with fda regul will misbrand a food section 403 r 1 b of the act state that a food is misbrand if it label or label contain a claim that expressli or by implic character the relationship of ani nutrient of the food to a diseas or a health relat condit unless the claim compli with regul promulg by fda 403 r 1 b emphasi ad by take this approach congress chose to permit onli those health claim on food that fda determin to be scientif valid effect recogn that health claim are so potenti mislead as to be inher mislead appli the same standard and procedur to health claim on dietari supplement as that that appli to food in convent food form will not affect the avail of ani dietari supplement will ensur that health claim that appear in label are scientif valid and understand and will subject all segment of the food industri to regul in a fair and consist manner those comment favor the same standard and procedur for reason of fair control of consum fraud and convey of valid inform about diet and it impact on a diseas or health relat condit serv to reinforc fdas conclus that the agenc propos rule should be final as propos the agenc disagre with argument that use of the same approach for dietari supplement as for convent food would deni million of american the dietari inform that they need to improv their health and therebi cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been avoid as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 in the absenc of adequ data to establish that health claim are valid assert about cost associ with the lack of inform in food label and about the benefit of consumpt of substanc in dietari supplement are high specul and high question fda doe not agre that it should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin the possibl of consum misunderstand fda must weigh the public health impact of permit a multitud of preliminari claim against the possibl that a signific portion of those claim will be determin to be not scientif valid the latter result would like produc a percept among mani consum that food label and health claim even those that are valid are not reliabl to the extent that as a result consum do not chang their dietari pattern to reduc their risk of diseas they will be less healthi and there will be more needless death from diseas and more cost to the nation economi rather than less when fda made this statement the phrase adequ data to establish that health claim are valid was intend to express the posit that until the valid requir of 101 14 c are met cost assert about the benefit of substanc consumpt are high specul and high question in general prior to fulfil of this requir there may often be studi with a wide varieti of strength and weak indic that there may or may not be a valid associ between a substanc and a diseas or health relat condit in decid whether or not to author a claim fda must consid that while benefit may accru from the avail of the claim there is a veri real possibl that signific cost may accru if the claim is author prematur a few studi may often be found about a multitud of associ and mani if not most of those associ will ultim be found not to be valid if fda were to permit preliminari claim about such a multitud of associ the agenc believ that ultim what would be lost is the confid of most consum in the valid of all claim that appear in food label fda believ that the cost to consum of such a situat would prove to be greater than the cost of not permit preliminari claim of greater signific howev is that needless death would ultim occur where consum would not chang their dietari pattern to adopt a more health diet the agenc believ that congress in it enact of the scientif standard in section 403 r 3 b i of the act struck what it believ to be an appropri balanc between the cost and benefit of claim on food in general fda is not awar of ani reason to strike a differ balanc for dietari supplement fda would like to assur all affect parti that the agenc will move as expediti as possibl to permit health claim onc the scientif evid is suffici support to conclud that associ between substanc and diseas or health relat condit are valid although some comment assert that claim base on a more lenient standard would not be confus becaus consum of dietari supplement are more knowledg than the general popul fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that there is noth that limit the purchas of dietari supplement to knowledg consum the comment did not submit justif for fda to chang it posit in this regard assert that use of the same scientif standard for dietari supplement as that establish for food in convent food form is counter to the 1990 amend becaus less inform about diet and diseas will be avail to consum are not correct under the 1990 amend author health claim provid consider more inform about the effect of diet on diseas where the effect are recogn as scientif valid than was the case befor the passag of the 1990 amend in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 fda author claim with respect to 7 relationship see 58 fr 2537 2552 2622 2665 2739 2787 and 2820 also in the feder regist of octob 14 1993 58 fr 53254 fda propos to permit health claim concern the relationship between folat and the risk of neural tube birth defect admit other health claim are not permit to appear on food label and label but congress clear intend through enact of section 403 r of the act that onli valid health claim be permit with respect to concern that consum will be forc to seek inform about diet and health from unregul sourc such as book and the media if fda doe not author preliminari claim fda advis that it must implement the provis of the amend as congress chose to enact them the 1990 amend focus onli on food label and label fda cannot ignor it clear respons under the 1990 amend becaus of concern about the unregul sourc of inform that were mention in the comment moreov while such sourc of inform may lead consum to seek out product contain particular substanc fdas action will ensur that the label and label of those product contain onli scientif valid inform that can dispel ani misconcept creat by the unregul sourc with respect to other concern express by these comment the agenc believ that the specif requir element in the health claim that it has author to date demonstr that the agenc is encourag consum to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet and lifestyl for exampl the specif requir in 101 72 c 2 a requir in part that a claim about calcium and osteoporosi make clear that an adequ level of exercis and a health diet are need in addit to adequ calcium consumpt argument that the agenc should allow preliminari claim becaus of fdas implement of the drug provis of the act have no merit assert about fdas propos action pertain to pediatr use for drug label in 57 fr 47423 are clear wrong the agenc propos action with respect to requir the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish pertain onli to drug for which there is no agenc approv for ani pediatr popul to use the drug in point of fact the agenc propos to requir this statement as a further warn that the product should not be use for pediatr popul thus this action provid no support for author preliminari health claim as fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33706 make dietari supplement subject to the same scientif standard and procedur as for convent food doe not render section 403 r 5 d of the act superflu this section requir that the agenc consid what procedur and standard respect the valid of claim are most appropri this is what the agenc has done the fact that the agenc has found that on balanc the standard and procedur establish for food in convent food form are also the most appropri for dietari supplement doe not render the agenc effort invalid or the under provis superflu the agenc was charg with exercis it expertis and discret and that is what it has done 5 a number of comment provid specif suggest about the way in which a more lenient approach could be implement some comment argu that the approach should be suffici lenient to permit market of dietari supplement without ani restrict some of these comment argu that dietari supplement need no stringent requir becaus dietari supplement could be adequ regul under the requir in section 403 a 1 of the act that the label of a food must be truth and not mislead other comment suggest that fda could requir a warn inform the consum that fda had not substanti particular claim appear on a product one comment suggest that substanti claim could be allow to appear within a specif advisori panel of the label while preliminari claim would be allow to appear onli outsid the panel anoth comment suggest that fda adopt a split label approach in which preliminari health claim would be allow but the agenc would have the right to comment upon them on the label one comment suggest that health claim for which there is substanti scientif evid but not yet signific scientif agreement be subject to a certif and notif procedur rather than rulemak proceed under the procedur suggest by the comment claim could be made for dietari supplement so long as 1 the claim expressli disclos the absenc of scientif agreement as to the relationship 2 the manufactur provid fda with a fulli document certif by a panel of at least three qualifi expert that there is substanti scientif evid support the claim and 3 fda doe not disapprov the claim within 90 day of receipt of the certif when addit inform is need the 90 day period could be extend an addit 45 day under this suggest altern fda would have an opportun to particip in the select of the expert panel one comment request that fda onli disallow the use of those health claim on dietari supplement that are not support by ani evid and that it classifi all other health claim into one of five categori and allow for their use on product in conjunct with a code system indic to consum the level of substanti that the claim has achiev the comment suggest that the highest categori be full substanti the second those claim that have a high degre of substanti as judg by non fda expert but that fda find to be not fulli substanti the third claim that have support in the form of doubl blind placebo control studi publish in peer review profession journal the fourth claim that are support by some evid from in vitro studi anim studi or other studi that do not involv human and the fifth those claim support by anecdot evid in support of it call for various approv level the comment state that simpli categor a claim as substanti or unsubstanti doe not accommod the realiti that full substanti of a health claim consist of cumul evid from mani studi the comment maintain that if fda were to place all claim that have not achiev full substanti into the same categori fda would not be provid a mean for the public to distinguish claim that are near substanti from those that are entir fals moreov the comment state that an agenc determin that a claim is or is not support by signific scientif agreement often reflect a polit decis rather than a scientif one the comment said that fda panel compris a veri small percentag of the scientif communiti that other scientist often disagre with the panel find and that there even may be differ opinion within the panel themselv the comment state that given these condit it is blatant dishonest and mislead to the public for fda to make a general declar that a claim is or is not substanti a few similar comment call for fda to devis a multilevel approv scheme for health claim on dietari supplement that would allow statement concern the tradit use of a product to appear on the label and would permit the label of a supplement that contain a substanc that was the subject of a pend health claim petit to indic that the product was under fda review for a health claim but not to indic the natur of the claim the comment state that the adopt of this approach would encourag manufactur of product that qualifi onli for the tradit use or claim pend approv categori to gather perform and submit research inform to fda in order to reach higher approv level one comment suggest that fda allow manufactur to use facsimil of the fda seal in conjunct with the various rate the comment assert that this approach would encourag manufactur to come into complianc with fda regul quick as the seal would becom valuabl market tool for which consum look when purchas supplement and the lack of a seal would becom a market disadvantag for a compani fda has consid these altern standard and procedur suggest by the comment and find that none of them have the characterist that are necessari to achiev the goal envis by congress in pass the 1990 amend previous in this preambl the agenc conclud that congress intend that fda adopt a scientif standard and a procedur that ensur that health claim that appear in label are scientif valid and understand none of the altern standard and procedur offer by the comment meet this object one of congress primari concern in pass the 1990 amend was the widespread use of health claim whose scientif valid had not been establish ref 1 the purpos of the 1990 amend was to bring that situat under control the problem with the altern procedur offer by the comment is that rather than bring the use of claim on dietari supplement under control they would ratifi the state of affair that caus congress to act as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act or that allow health claim base on the tradit use of the supplement or the exist of substanti scientif evid but not signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim would be inconsist with congresss desir to ensur that health claim that are made on dietari supplement or on ani other food are scientif valid fda point out that if such claim were to be permit consum would be face with a multitud of claim some valid and some not valid fda state that it would be unlik that consum could distinguish between valid and invalid claim although comment on the dietari supplement health claim propos assert that consum would not be confus by a multitud of claim the comment did not actual go further in address how consum would react to such a situat in food label more specif the comment did not provid data to resolv the question of whether consum would be abl to understand gradat of scientif reliabl of claim on food label or whether consum would in fact be left as confus as they were befor passag of the 1990 amend while a number of comment did assert that some studi show that consum are abl to use various advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner the studi were not actual submit in the absenc of the studi fda has no basi upon which it can evalu the assert of the relev of the studi to food label in the absenc of evid to the contrari the agenc consid it more like that consum would be consider confus by a multitud of claim with differ degre of reliabl one of the purpos of the 1990 amend was to end such confus see statement of mr waxman 136 congression record h12953 ref 2 therefor fda reject this assert approach such as those involv a split label or the use of an fda seal would also not be consist with the congression desir for scientif valid becaus manufactur would still be abl to market dietari supplement with claim that were not scientif valid even if fda seal were be use to distinguish those claim that fda consid to be valid there would be a question as to whether consum would be abl to ascertain which claim were preliminari and which were not these approach would not restrict the number of health claim that were of question valid about which congress was specif concern ref 1 thus fda has conclud that it would not be appropri to adopt ani of the altern approach suggest by the comment 6 sever comment suggest that fda adopt the reason substanti standard use by the feder trade commiss ftc see ftc polici statement regard advertis substanti program 49 fr 30999 august 2 1984 the comment assert that under this polici fda could allow manufactur to make claim provid that the natur of the scientif find is accur repres the degre of evid is not misrepres and the claim pass a rough cost benefit test the comment argu that this polici would facilit harmon with the ftc regul govern the use of health claim in food advertis would allow consum to have access to truth nonmislead and reliabl label inform and would still allow fda to take action against those dietari supplement bear health claim that are not proper substanti argument that fda should adopt for dietari supplement ftcs approach for regul advertis are not consist with congress expect for health claim while the ftc and fda are work togeth to achiev as much consist in their approach to health claim as their respect statut allow adopt by fda of the ftc advertis substanti approach would not provid fda the confid congress intend concern the scientif valid of the claim specif as explain abov one of congress main purpos in pass the 1990 amend was to ensur that health claim made in food label are scientif valid no such assur of scientif valid is provid under the standard that ftc must employ under that standard there must be some evid to support a claim but it need not rise to the level of establish the claim valid thus the ftc standard is not adequ for health claim in this context it is appropri to reiter fdas respons to comment assert that it was bound to follow case involv ftcs regul of advertis in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2528 although case involv ftc may sometim be relev it is import to note that fundament differ exist between the regulatori scheme administ by the two agenc congress has long recogn the divis of role between the two agenc ftc concentr on the interest of commerc and econom need wherea the object of fda is the health of the peopl ftc regul unfair competit and trade practic includ food advertis see for exampl 15 usc section 45 and 52 in contrast fda is a scientif agenc empow to regul the food label among other thing under section 403 r 3 b i of the act fda may permit health claim on food onli if it has determin that those claim meet the statutori test for scientif valid the law under which ftc oper do not includ a compar statutori standard thus it would not be appropri for fda to follow the case law involv ftc iii the final regul in light of the forego fda is subject dietari supplement to the same standard and procedur that appli to food in convent food form the agenc believ that this approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other thus the agenc is revis 101 14 and 101 70 to includ dietari supplement a definit in the health claim propos fda propos definit for health claim substanc nutrit valu and dietari supplement to serv as tool for clear establish the scope of the type of claim that would be subject to the regul promulg under section 403 r 1 b of the act in addit the agenc propos a definit for disqualifi nutrient level to establish limit on the level at which certain nutrient that are known to increas the risk of a diseas or health relat condit could be present in a food and the food would still be elig to bear a health claim see section 403 r 3 a ii of the act in the health claim final rule the agenc adopt definit for the term health claim substanc nutrit valu and disqualifi nutrient level that it revis in respons either to comment or to the ds act see 101 14 a 1 2 3 and 5 also fda adopt a definit for the term diseas or health relat condit although the term is use in the definit of health claim and the term serv to identifi one of the basic element of a health claim the agenc had not propos a definit for it the agenc ad this definit to clarifi the coverag of the health claim provis see 101 14 a 6 becaus of the ds act the agenc reserv the question as to whether these definit would appli to dietari supplement the agenc also did not includ a definit of dietari supplement in the final rule becaus of the moratorium impos by the ds act in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda propos to adopt the same regulatori scheme for health claim for dietari supplement that it had establish for food in convent food form to effect this tentat decis the agenc propos to revis the definit of substanc to make clear that it cover both food in convent food form and dietari supplement and to establish a definit for dietari supplement fda receiv no comment on the former aspect of the propos therefor the agenc is adopt it as propos howev fda did receiv some comment on it propos definit of dietari supplement 1 dietari supplement fda propos the follow definit for the term dietari supplement propos 101 14 a 4 dietari supplement mean a food not in convent food form that suppli a compon to supplement the diet by increas the total dietari intak of that compon in the past fda has taken a posit that the term dietari supplement appli onli to supplement compos of essenti nutrient howev fda did not propos to limit the definit in 101 14 a in this way becaus section 403 r 5 d of the act includ dietari supplement of herb substanc that general contain few essenti nutrient in addit the legisl histori indic that the term other nutrit substanc could includ a number of substanc that have not been shown to be essenti or nutrient ref 4 7 one comment commend the agenc for propos a definit of dietari supplement that recogn that these food could have compon other than substanc known to be essenti nutrient the comment assert that the propos definit would appropri move supplement out of the food addit categori fda advis that the comment assert that the definit move dietari supplement out of the food addit categori is not correct a dietari supplement as the definit recogn is a compound food that may includ compound that are food addit whether a compon of food is a food addit or not is determin under section 201 s of the act 21 usc 321 s not section 403 r of the act congress specif provid in section 9 of the 1990 amend that these amend shall not be constru to alter the author of the secretari of health and human servic under the feder food drug and cosmet act thus the compon of dietari supplement that are food addit are still fulli subject to the food addit requir under section 409 of the act 8 a few comment request that the propos definit of dietari supplement be modifi to explicit includ all herbal extract one of these comment assert that the definit should includ process or unprocess plant part bark leav flower fruit and stem as well as extract of essenti oil market as tea powder tablet capsul and elixir fda is adopt the definit of dietari supplement as propos this definit is intent broad to cover the rang of substanc that under the legisl histori could be includ in a dietari supplement and could be the subject of a health claim the purpos of the definit of dietari supplement is not to defin the substanc that may be elig to be the subject of a health claim but to defin the form in which they are to be sold to be subject to regul as a dietari supplement under the scheme that fda is adopt and that congress envis see ref 4 statement of senat metzenbaum the determin as to what substanc are appropri the subject of a health claim is made on a case by case basi base on the factor set out in 101 14 b and the evid present to the agenc the agenc disagre with the comment in one respect howev tea are food in convent food form and thus not includ within the definit of dietari supplement 9 one comment assert the definit of dietari supplement should includ food in convent food form that are fortifi with a vitamin or miner to a level of 50 percent or more of the refer daili intak rdi per serv eg mani breakfast cereal fda doe not agre that such food should be includ in the definit of dietari supplement as discuss in the preambl to the dietari supplement propos 58 fr 33700 at 33707 fda has limit this definit to food not in convent food form to reflect the approach taken by congress in the ds act the manag statement for the ds act from the senat and the hous ref 3 clear state that the moratorium on the implement of the 1990 amend appli onli to dietari supplement not in the form of convent food becaus food in convent food form were not cover by the ds act moratorium the health claim regul alreadi appli to them consequ fda believ that it will reduc confus about the impact of these regul if the agenc limit coverag of the term dietari supplement to food not in convent food form of cours food in convent food form that are formul to supplement the dietari intak of nutrient will be free to reflect their characterist in their common or usual name eg vitamin and miner supplement cereal 2 nutrit valu in the health claim final rule fda defin nutrit valu as follow nutrit valu mean a valu in sustain human exist by such process as promot growth replac loss of essenti nutrient or provid energi although fda did not propos ani chang in the definit of nutrit valu in the dietari supplement health claim propos mani comment express concern about the impact of this definit in conjunct with the preliminari requir in 101 14 b 3 i that the substanc that is the subject of a health claim contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 o and that the substanc must retain that attribut when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim preliminari requir are criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim an indepth discuss of all preliminari requir follow in section iii b of this document 10 some comment urg the agenc to broaden it definit of nutrit valu these comment urg the agenc to recogn that the process by which a nutrient promot health maintain proper bodili function and protect the bodi from the develop of chronic diseas or other health relat condit are in and of themselv characterist of nutrit valu the comment note that the basic function of vitamin e for exampl relat to it antioxid properti in prevent cell damag by trap peroxyl free radic and inhibit the oxid of unsatur fatti acid also the comment point out that fiber doe not promot growth replac essenti nutrient or provid energi but that congress specif requir fda to studi the relationship between various diseas and fiber some of the comment ask that the phrase prevent or repair the negat metabol consequ of life process be ad to the list of process that character the nutrit valu of a food to ensur that such compon can be the subject of health claim a few comment assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit howev one comment maintain that the definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement the comment support it posit by agre with fdas statement in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 that the inclus of the phrase such as in the definit ensur that the three referenc process are exampl of how a substanc may confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list the comment that highlight fdas use of the phrase such process as in this definit is correct fda intend the three referenc process to be exampl of how a substanc may confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list of the function that provid such valu as fda explain in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 the definit of nutrit valu is intend to be veri flexibl the agenc incorpor this flexibl in the definit becaus fda recogn that certain substanc can play a major role in reduc the risk of certain chronic diseas and may confer their benefit through a number of process fda believ that the agenc should evalu the nutrit valu claim for a substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim as describ in a health claim petit on a case by case basi this approach will best ensur that the definit retain it intend flexibl and doe not becom an unintent barrier to author for legitim health claim fda doe believ howev that this preambl should provid guidanc concern how the agenc will determin if a claim nutrient diseas relationship deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc in general the agenc will look for evid that the claim effect on diseas is associ with the normal mainten of human exist if the substanc is use to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit the action of the substanc is clear beyond a normal mainten function and the health benefit would therefor not deriv from the substanc nutrit valu such a substanc would be a drug note also that claim about classic nutrient defici diseas are not health claim see 58 fr 2478 at 2481 fda recogn that mani of the benefit mention in the comment may deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc the agenc broad definit of nutrit valu includ assist in the effici function of classic nutrit process and of other metabol process necessari for the normal mainten of human exist dietari fiber for exampl help to assur normal intestin transit time therebi provid nutrit valu by promot effici bowel function vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag with respect to assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit the agenc point out that the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2501 through 2502 fulli address this matter and conclud that a claim that a substanc can be use in the prevent diagnosi cure mitig or treatment of a diseas or symptom is inappropri for a food see section 201 g 1 b of the act and 101 9 k 1 21 usc 101 9 k 1 fda reach this conclus becaus the relationship of a food or a food compon to a diseas is quit differ from that of a drug the comment make these assert did not provid ani basi upon which fda could conclud that the agenc posit in this matter should be differ for dietari supplement than for food in convent food form as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule the surgeon general report on nutrit and health ref 5 point out that apart from classic disord result from dietari defici of essenti nutrient eg pellagra and niacin it has prove difficult to demonstr causal associ between specif dietari factor and chronic or other diseas eg dietari fiber and cancer the report state develop of the major chronic diseas condit coronari heart diseas stroke diabet or cancer is affect by multipl genet environment and behavior factor among which diet is onli one albeit an import compon these other factor interact with diet in way that are not complet understood in addit food themselv are complex they may contain some factor that promot diseas as well as other that are protect the relationship of dietari fat intak to causat of atherosclerot heart diseas is a promin exampl an excess intak of total fat if character by high satur fat is associ with high blood cholesterol level and therefor an increas risk for coronari heart diseas in mani popul a higher proport of mono and polyunsatur fat in relat to satur fat is associ with lower blood cholesterol level and therefor with a reduc risk for coronari heart diseas becaus of these complex definit scientif proof that specif dietari factor are respons for specif chronic diseas condit is difficult and may not be possibl to obtain given avail technolog ref 5 11 sever comment argu that the definit of nutrit valu should includ level of nutrient that are achiev onli through the use of fortifi food or dietari supplement sever of these comment referenc studi recent report in the new england journal of medicin that indic that vitamin e reduc the risk of heart diseas when consum at level that are almost imposs to achiev through a convent diet but that can be easili and safe attain through the use of dietari supplement these comment assert that it would be inappropri for fda to categor the involv nutrient level of vitamin e as therapeut and to refus to consid approv a health claim simpli becaus the claim concern level of a nutrient abov that achiev in a normal daili diet a few of the comment support this assert by note that the mechan by which vitamin e protect against cell damag when consum at normal dietari level is ident to the mechan by which it protect against heart diseas when consum at higher level the comment maintain that in case such as this one the agenc should approv health claim for use strict on dietari supplement provid that the nutrient is safe when consum at the level at which the claim effect is achiev and the supplement is intend to be consum to optim health rather than as a drug the comment support this regulatori approach by note that the health benefit of calcium occur when the nutrient is consum at increas level that can be achiev through the diet or by supplement and state that vitamin e should not be treat differ simpli becaus the benefici level cannot be reach without the use of dietari supplement similar comment argu that fda should at least avoid establish a maximum level of a nutrient that is consid to be characterist of nutrit valu one of these comment note such an approach result in an extrem fuzzi line becaus the maximum level of a nutrient that is achiev in a diet vari wide from one individu to anoth as an exampl the comment point out that a person who eat ten orang or drink a quart of orang juic per day get more vitamin c than is provid by most current market vitamin c supplement a few comment assert that there is much scientif disagr over what level of a nutrient are nutrit with mani scientist contend that level much higher than the us recommend daili allow us rda fall within the definit a few comment request that fda explicit express in it regul a polici that nutrit valu may involv relat high level of a nutrient a few comment maintain that fda should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it has proof to the contrari in support of this posit a number of comment object to the use of niacin effect on blood cholesterol level in the dietari supplement propos as an exampl of an effect that is not nutrit one of these comment question fdas assert that niacin doe not exhibit cholesterol reduc properti when ingest at the level convent associ with it function as a vitamin the comment state that niacin vitamin effect occur below the level of tissu satur and maintain that the excret of niacin when consum at higher level known to be associ with cholesterol lower effect doe not necessarili indic that tissu satur has occur this comment also disagre with the agenc statement that the occurr of liver damag when high level of niacin are consum indic that the effect of niacin at these level is not nutrit in natur the comment argu that it is quit possibl that niacin continu to have nutrit effect at these level but simpli is overload the bodi normal metabol pathway for rid itself of excess level of the nutrient the comment assert that while legitim safeti concern exist in particular case of excess nutrient intak fda should not use this fact to conclud that high level of those nutrient are inher nonnutrit in natur and are instead pharmacolog other comment express the belief that noth in the propos regul would automat exclud high level of nutrient from the definit of nutrit valu and urg the agenc to includ such level in instanc where they would benefit the public health these comment also agre with fdas decis to review on a case by case basi whether the amount of a substanc is appropri as the subject of a health claim one of these comment state that such an approach would help to ensur that health inform about fortifi food and dietari supplement can be convey without trigger the drug regul fda doe not believ that it is necessari for the rule to explicit state that nutrit valu includ relat high level of a nutrient as some comment point out the case by case approach which as state abov is intrins link with the preliminari requir in the provis of 101 14 b 3 i provid the agenc with consider flexibl with respect to high level of substanc in dietari supplement under this approach fda has not as a general rule establish ani maximum level at which a nutrient would ceas to have nutrit valu furthermor the agenc advis that there is no basi for concern that fda would use safeti concern alon to conclud that high level of nutrient are pharmacolog fda will not do so as some of the comment point out petit for claim that requir that high level of substanc be ingest should have no problem demonstr that the substanc has nutrit valu where the mechan by which the substanc affect the risk of diseas at these high level is the same as the mechan by which it function as a nutrient at normal dietari level howev it will still be necessari as the agenc explain in respons to the previous comment for the petit to show that the substanc effect on diseas is associ with the normal function of the human bodi eg the substanc could not be use to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit in it respons to the previous comment the agenc acknowledg that vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag if there are situat where it can be establish that this same antioxid mechan affect the risk of diseas when the vitamin is consum at level signific higher than normal dietari level such level would satisfi the requir in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc retain it food attribut ie it nutrit valu when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim fda doe not agre howev that it should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it has proof to the contrari it would not be practic for the agenc to bear the burden of determin the mechan by which the claim effect is occur for each petit claim thus the agenc find that it is appropri to requir that petition provid the basi for whi it is reason to conclud that the claim effect is nutrit and not pharmacolog howev the agenc doe not necessarili expect absolut proof on this issu fda will evalu petit on this issu on a case by case basi the agenc has consid assert that the dietari supplement propos should not have cite the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin as an exampl of a high dose effect that is not nutrit fda has again conclud that niacin is an appropri exampl becaus there are signific indic that a nutrit mechan is not respons for the cholesterol lower effect that occur with high level of niacin intak when fda state in the dietari supplement propos that level of niacin necessari to produc the cholesterol lower effect are far in excess of the level at which there is tissu satur for niacin vitamin function the agenc was attempt to explain that for niacin function as a vitamin there is a level beyond which addit niacin will not provid addit function result for that vitamin the term tissu satur may impli either this type of situat sometim refer to as function satur or the type of situat refer to in one of the comment wherein the tissu is satur with a concentr of a substanc and more substanc could immedi spill out into the urin fda was not attempt to assert that the tissu itself was actual satur there is no question that addit niacin will be absorb by cell when the vitamin function satur level is reach in addit to the situat with vitamin function satur there are other indic that the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin do not result from the same mechan as that present by it vitamin function vitamin function satur may be achiev through dietari supplement with either of the two form of the vitamin nicotin acid or nicotinamid howev onli nicotin acid provid at high level the cholesterol reduc effect such effect do not appear with high level consumpt of nicotinamid ref 6 if the same mechan were involv with the vitamin function of niacin as with the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin both form of this vitamin should have cholesterol reduc properti 3 health claim in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda did not propos to make ani modif in the definit of health claim in 101 14 a 1 health claim mean ani claim made on the label or in label of a food includ a dietari supplement that expressli or by implic includ third parti refer written statement eg a brand name includ a term such as heart symbol eg a heart symbol or vignett character the relationship of ani substanc to a diseas or health relat condit impli health claim includ those statement symbol vignett or other form of communic that suggest within the context in which they are present that a relationship exist between the presenc or level of ani substanc in the food and a diseas or health relat condit nonetheless fda receiv sever comment on this definit 12 some comment assert that fda should clarifi the type of statement that will be regul as health claim a few of these comment ask whether statement that indic that a product may be use in maintain good health eg substanc x may be benefici to good health or that describ the biochem function of vitamin miner and other nutrient eg vitamin a is necessari for good eyesight protein help build a strong bodi will be consid to be health claim the comment object to fdas failur to provid clear instruct in this regard these comment assert that the agenc allow of case by case interpret of the regul will hinder industri complianc creat enforc problem for the agenc and caus continu antagon between fda and the food industri fda believ that it provid ampl guidanc on what type of statement constitut health claim in the health claim final rule as the agenc explain in the preambl of that rule 58 fr 2478 at 2479 through 2488 the definit establish that a claim must have at least two basic element for it to be regul as a health claim first the claim must be about a substanc as defin in 101 14 a 2 second the claim must character the relationship of that substanc to a diseas or health relat condit as defin in 101 14 a 6 diseas or health relat condit mean damag to an organ part structur or system of the bodi such that it doe not function proper eg cardiovascular diseas or a state of health lead to such dysfunct eg hypertens except that diseas result from essenti nutrient defici eg scurvi pellagra are not includ in this definit claim pertain to such diseas are therebi not subject to 101 14 or 101 70 if a statement has one of these element without the other it would not be a health claim although it may still be subject to regul under other provis of the act eg the requir of section 403 a 1 of the act that a label statement be truth and not mislead thus all of the statement mention by the comment would not be health claim becaus they do not address a diseas or health relat condit as defin under 101 14 a 6 the agenc has provid a lengthi and detail discuss on what type of statement constitut health claim in the health claim final rule at the page cite abov 12 a few comment ask whether fda would remov or prohibit the publish of book contain inform on health claim and argu that such regul would clear be unconstitut other comment address the issu of whether fdas health claim regul for dietari supplement would appli to advertis one of these comment interpret an excerpt from the report of fdas task forc on dietari supplement as an attempt to disallow the use of unapprov health claim in magazin newslett or other media channel unless the inform has been preapprov by fda that excerpt read the task forc consid various issu in it deliber includ how to assur the safeti of dietari supplement how to limit the potenti for fraud ie diseas claim made on label or through other mean eg magazin articl newslett and advertis the comment further assert that this same intent is reflect in the health claim regul propos in novemb 1991 the comment state that this broad base applic of the health claim regul would sever jeopard the report of health and diseas relat inform in almost everi form of media would inhibit the evolut of scientif knowledg would have a signific negat impact on the public health of america and was like unconstitut fda advis that the provis of this regul pertain onli to a product label and label this regul doe noth to censor the content of book magazin or advertis this regul also doe not in ani way regul the avail of book magazin or advertis howev firm sometim choos to use such materi as label for their product and if use as such the materi would be subject to this regul for exampl sometim firm copi an articl from a magazin and display that articl with a product that is offer for sale under such circumst the articl would be a part of the label of that product what is signific to note is that these regul in no way limit what articl may be publish or what book may be print they limit onli the claim that may be made in the label of food product under the act advertis may provid object evid of what the intend use of a particular product is if the advertis reveal that the product is intend to be use as a drug the product may be regul as a drug in addit claim made in advertis may affect the type of nutrit label that is provid see 101 9 j claim made in advertis howev are not subject to section 403 r 1 b of the act thus the agenc find no merit in the concern express by these comment b preliminari requir for a claim in the health claim final rule fda establish sever criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim the criteria provid that the substanc must 1 be associ with a diseas or health relat condit for which the general us popul is at risk altern the relev of the claim may be explain within the context of the daili diet see 101 14 b 1 2 be a food see 101 14 b 2 and b 3 i and 3 be safe and law under applic food safeti provis of the act see 101 14 b 3 ii these criteria reflect not onli the requir of section 403 r of the act but also the fact that fda is charg with ensur that the food suppli is safe and that the food label is not mislead given that agenc evalu of the valid of a health claim will be resourc intens fda decid not to undertak such evalu unless a petit for a health claim demonstr that the preliminari requir are met while fda had propos in novemb of 1991 that these preliminari requir cover substanc in dietari supplement as well as food in convent food form the provis of the ds act preclud the agenc from appli these preliminari requir to substanc in dietari supplement at the time that the rule was final thus the preliminari requir establish in the health claim final rule appli onli to substanc in food in convent food form the dietari supplement health claim propos contain provis to subject the compon of dietari supplement to the same preliminari requir in 101 14 b that appli to ani other substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim this final rule for dietari supplement retain these provis as propos specif refer to dietari supplement in 101 14 b 1 and b 2 is not necessari becaus the requir in these paragraph appli general to ani substanc and fdas revis of the definit of substanc in 101 14 a 2 includ the compon of dietari supplement within the coverag of this term howev fda propos to add a specif refer to dietari supplement to paragraph b 3 i of 101 14 to clarifi that the substanc may be a compon of a food that is in the form of a dietari supplement the onli comment on the issu agre with the agenc propos revis accord as propos fda is includ in the final regul a refer to dietari supplement in the codifi languag of 101 14 b 3 i specif fda is insert the phrase regardless of whether the food is in convent food form or dietari supplement form into 101 14 b 3 i 1 effect on general popul 13 one comment argu that the propos requir that a substanc be associ with a diseas or health relat condit for which the general us popul or a subpopul thereof is at risk or that the claim be explain within the context of the daili diet would prohibit the appear of health claim on herbal dietari supplement howev the comment did not explain how the requir would have this effect and the comment own analysi of how garlic would or would not meet various propos requir indic that garlic would meet this particular requir fda doe not agre that this preliminari requir will present ani signific barrier to the appear of health claim on dietari supplement to the contrari as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2499 fda intend to employ a flexibl approach in interpret this provis the altern aspect of the provis which creat the possibl of claim about the relationship of a substanc to a diseas or health relat condit that affect veri few in the us popul as long as the petit in support of the claim address that fact and the relev of the claim in the context of the total daili diet evid a determin by fda to provid the widest latitud possibl for propos claim to qualifi under this provis 14 one comment request that fda not limit the diseas or health relat condit that may be the subject of a health claim to those for which the entir unit state is at potenti risk the comment assert that health claim should also be allow in case where dietari factor have been conclus shown to affect diseas or health relat condit for which onli a particular subport of the us popul is at risk eg ovarian cancer in women fda advis that the general elig provis of it health claim regul in 101 14 b 1 do not contain the restrict cite by the comment while these provis contain a requir that health claim pertain to diseas or health relat condit affect the general us popul they also provid that health claim may pertain to diseas or health relat condit for which an identifi subgroup of the us popul is at risk thus ovarian cancer in women would clear be an appropri subject of a health claim 2 compon of food within the context of a daili diet the preliminari requir that a substanc that is to be the subject of a health claim must be a food appear in 101 14 b 2 and b 3 i if the substanc is present at decreas dietari level under 101 14 b 2 it must be a nutrient that is requir to be includ in nutrit label eg cholesterol total fat if the substanc is present at other than decreas dietari level under 101 14 b 3 i it 1 must contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani other technic effect list in 170 3 o to the food and 2 must retain that attribut when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim 15 numer comment express concern about the aspect of the preliminari requir of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in view of the agenc definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 a number of these comment character these provis as an attack by the agenc against dietari supplement some comment assert that the propos preliminari requir would prohibit dietari supplement especi those contain herb from bear health claim comment point out that mani herb such as garlic are special process to remov the flavor or odor from the final supplement product a number of comment explain that such supplement would fail to meet this requir becaus their benefici effect on the bodi often are deriv from substanc uniqu to the plant that do not promot growth replac loss of essenti nutrient or provid energi a few comment also note that mani herb contain insignific amount of vitamin miner and other nutrient some comment assert that the adopt of ani preliminari requir that would automat disqualifi herbal dietari supplement from bear health claim would undermin the intent of congress to establish a nondrug review process for health claim involv herb these comment assert that the 1990 amend clear provid that herbal dietari supplement can be the topic of a health claim furthermor a comment assert that the court of appeal held in nutrilab inc v schweiker 713 2d 335 338 7th cir 1983 that some product such as prune juic or coffe may be consum for reason other than tast aroma or nutrit valu one comment assert that all dietari supplement alreadi meet the this preliminari requir the comment note that a substanc to be consum at other than decreas dietari level may also be shown to be a food by contribut ani technic effect list in 170 3 o the comment state that 170 3 o 20 list one of those technic effect as nutrient supplement and broad defin a nutrient supplement as substanc which are necessari for the bodi nutrit and metabol process fda doe not believ that it is over restrict to requir as it doe in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc be a food or a compon of food for it to be the subject of a health claim section 403 of the act which includ the health claim provis state a food shall be deem to be misbrand emphasi ad thus section 403 r of the act describ the circumst in which a food will and will not be misbrand if it bear a health claim it is therefor appropri for the agenc to make it incumb on the propon of a health claim to demonstr that the substanc that is to be the subject of the claim is a food or compon of food fda disagre with the comment interpret of the nutrilab decis as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2499 2500 the nutrilab court adopt a common sens definit of food under section 201 f 1 of the act when the statut defin food as articl use for food it mean that the statutori definit of food includ articl use by peopl in the ordinari way most peopl use food primarili for tast aroma or nutrit valu nutrilab 713 2d at 338 other court have follow suit see unit state v undetermin quantiti of cal ban 3000 776 f supp 249 254 55 ednc 1991 american health product co v hay 574 f supp 1498 1508 09 sdni 1983 affd 744 2d 912 2d cir 1984 by describ tast aroma and nutrit valu as the primari reason for consum food the nutrilab court acknowledg that a food consum for one of these reason might sometim also be consum for an addit purpos 713 2d at 338 give prune juic and coffe as exampl of food that may be consum on occas for reason other than tast aroma or nutrit valu under nutrilab howev a substanc whose use do not includ tast aroma or nutrit valu is not a food in 101 14 b 3 i fda incorpor this common sens definit of food and the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o which reflect the fact that the definit of food in section 201 f 3 of the act includ articl use for compon of food as a preliminari requir to ensur that a substanc that is to be the subject of a health claim is in fact a food this preliminari requir is fundament becaus both the compon of a food that is the subject of a health claim and a compon of a drug have a characteriz relationship to a diseas congress recogn this fact by creat an except from section 201 g 1 b of the act in the definit of drug for food that bear a claim author under section 403 r of the act thus it is crucial to the continu viabil of the act itself that the choic of the test that determin whether a claim that character the relationship of a substanc to a diseas can be made be base on the appropri factor under the act that choic turn in part on whether the substanc is a food therefor fda has reflect in 101 14 b 3 i the judici recogn characterist of a food in this regard interest person should not presum that inclus of the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in 101 14 b 3 i mean that substanc that may be classifi within one or more of the categori of food addit in 170 3 o automat meet this preliminari requir the classif within 170 3 o are of a general natur to reflect the use to which food ingredi are put all of the classif pertain to the effect of the ingredi on food eg by affect the textur of the food rather than on the human bodi onli a substanc that is use for the technic effect in 170 3 o 20 that of a nutrient supplement has the potenti to have a use effect in the bodi becaus of the characterist that caus it to be use in the food the nutrient supplement categori includ substanc which are necessari for the bodi nutrit and metabol process as the comment themselv recogn not everi compon of a dietari supplement has such an effect in view of the agenc broad flexibl definit of nutrit valu fda doe not find ani merit in argument that the provis requir that a substanc be a food should be remov to the contrari fda believ that these provis will benefit the public health by allow the agenc to devot it limit resourc for review of petit to those that are appropri for consider under the health claim provis of the act accord fda consid these provis essenti element under the framework that it has creat in it regul for the regul of health claim and fulli consist with the act fda disagre with the comment character of it action as an attack against dietari supplement fda believ that the combin effect of 101 14 b 3 i the preliminari requir that a substanc be a food and 101 14 a 3 the definit of nutrit valu will not present dietari supplement with ani unreason barrier for agenc evalu of potenti health claim for compon of these product without question these provis do restrict health claim to effect on a diseas or a health relat condit result from the nutrit valu of substanc howev as one comment point out the current definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement one observ that might bear make in this context is that congress has given the agenc a statutori structur with which to deal in relev part that structur divid the world of substanc that have a relationship to diseas into food and drug congress place the health claim provis on the food side of the ledger fda is charg with implement those provis in accord with the act and applic legal preced fda has announc it intent to implement the health claim provis as flexibl as possibl but at some point the agenc simpli cannot be as flexibl as some of the comment have suggest at that point the agenc would start to erod the scheme that the statut has establish for drug the agenc cannot do that if congress intend someth that goe beyond the scheme that fda has establish in these final regul then what is requir is a chang in the law itself 16 mani comment object to the aspect of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc retain it food status ie it nutrit valu when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim almost all concern was direct toward consumpt of substanc at level signific higher than those present in the daili diet some comment urg fda to evalu propos health claim involv relat high level of nutrient on the ground that categor prohibit them would deni american benefici inform rather than educ them on how to alter their diet to achiev optim health other comment state that fdas categor refus to evalu such health claim becaus of the nutrient level involv would direct violat both the proxmir amend and the congression intent behind the 1990 amend these comment note that the 1990 amend provid for the appear of health claim on food and state that subject to certain condit the proxmir amend prohibit against regul a vitamin supplement as a drug sole becaus it exceed the level of potenc which the secretari determin is nutrit ration or use guarante the regul of vitamin as food regardless of the level of nutrient that they suppli the comment also state that congress envis the approv of such health claim as it was awar that dietari supplement substanti in excess of the us rdas were routin be consum by american and it chose to direct that fda conduct a review of antioxid vitamin cancer claim with dietari supplement in mind other comment further assert that fda was attempt to circumv the proxmir amend and creat maximum potenc level for all supplement by establish an upper limit for nutrit valu fda doe not agre that ani conflict with section 411 of the act is present by a requir that to be the subject of a health claim the substanc must be a food that is consum primarili for it tast aroma or nutrit valu there is noth in the health claim final rule or in the regul establish by this document that will affect in ani way the avail of dietari supplement or consum freedom to choos to purchas them rather the regul that fda is establish are intend to ensur that ani health claim that may be made for dietari supplement are scientif valid this is what section 403 r 5 d of the act direct fda to do noth in these regul would necessarili prevent a supplement from bear a health claim when it contain a level of a substanc that exceed the level achiev in the context of the daili diet to the contrari the final rule concern calcium and osteoporosi for exampl which was publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2665 permit a calcium health claim for dietari supplement and requir onli that the supplement label advis consum in appropri circumst that there is no known benefit from consum more than 200 percent of the recommend daili intak for calcium section 411 of the act doe not author health claim for dietari supplement or in ani way affect fdas author under section 403 r 5 d of the act to regul such claim under section 411 a 1 b of the act fda may not classifi a dietari supplement as a drug sole becaus it contain a vitamin or miner at a level that exceed the level of potenc that the agenc determin is nutrit ration or use noth in these propos regul would do so absent a claim fda will not consid a dietari supplement to be a drug becaus it contain vitamin or miner at level abov those normal found in food howev a claim on a product is an indic of the product intend use if a claim reveal that the product is intend for a use other than for it tast aroma or nutrit valu then noth in section 411 of the act would requir that it be treat as a food 17 mani comment address the circumst under which dietari supplement should be consid drug a number of these comment refer to the follow agenc statement in the health claim final rule comment 49 58 fr 2478 at 2501 a product that is intend for medicin effect that is intend for use in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas is a drug and not a food thus there is no basi under the act for fda to permit health claim for herb whose onli known use is for medicin effect health benefit of such herb may appear in the label onli in accord with the drug provis of the act although a few comment agre with this statement mani comment express categor opposit to the classif of ani herb or other dietari supplement as drug while most of these comment did not offer reason in support of their posit one comment express concern that such a polici would be ground for fda to categor ban all such supplement as unapprov new drug sever comment note that mani herb have tradit been use both as food and drug and ask for assur that fda would not automat regul such herb as drug other comment argu that herb should alway be regul as food where they are consum for their nutrit valu some comment stress that intend use as state on it label should be the determin factor in decid whether a supplement should be regul as a food or as a drug as an exampl one of these comment state that a supplement market for a specif therapeut use eg a vitamin c tablet sold to cure cancer is appropri regard as a drug while a supplement sold to be taken over a period of time to reduc the risk of develop a diseas eg a vitamin c tablet sold to be taken daili to reduc the risk of cancer should be regul as a food the comment assert that this approach is consist with fdas determin that a supplement contain larg amount of niacin should be regul as a drug when consum to lower serum cholesterol anoth of these comment emphas that a consum use of a legal label product should not have ani weight in determin whether that product is a drug as an exampl the comment note that fda doe not regul either fiber or water as a drug as long as their label doe not bear drug claim even though consum may use them to facilit bowel movement or to prevent mitig or treat dehydr respect a few comment suggest that fda determin whether a substanc is a food or a drug by it chemic composit the comment assert that while the boundari between drug and supplement is fuzzi at time drug are typic synthet molecul that are of a uniqu and patent natur while dietari supplement consist of natur nonpatent materi anoth comment state that fda should exempt substanc taken to treat a symptom of a diseas from regul as drug as the act defin as drug onli those substanc use in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of the diseas itself earlier in this preambl fda explain that these regul do not affect the avail of dietari supplement again these regul affect onli the food label and food label fda has no intent of ban all dietari supplement of herb or similar substanc as unapprov new drug fda will carri out it respons to regul inappropri claim but the agenc will not attempt to restrict the sale of dietari supplement to consum unless the supplement present safeti concern with respect to the specif word for use in label statement fda advis that statement that a product may be effect in the cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas will make the product a drug howev statement that a product may reduc the risk of develop a diseas or health relat condit may or may not make the product a drug exact how a substanc diseas relationship is to be character is one of the issu that the agenc will address in decid whether to author a health claim and how to ensur that the claim describ the signific of the substanc in affect the diseas or health relat condit fda point out that as a general matter mere use term such as reduc the risk instead of prevent will not automat make a claim a health claim and not a drug claim fda will make a case by case assess base on all relev factor in determin whether a claim is appropri subject to the health claim regim the agenc also agre that the main focus in decid whether a product is subject to regul as a food or a drug is the intent of the vendor and not how consum use the product although how consum understand claim that are made can be use to determin vendor intent fda advis that there is no provis in the act for the agenc to exempt statement about symptom of diseas from caus product to be regul as drug although such statement may not be claim that the product will treat the diseas that caus the symptom the statement clear pertain to the mitig of diseas by address the symptom caus by the diseas section 201 g 1 b of the act provid in part that articl intend for use in the mitig of diseas are drug similar there is no provis in the act for fda to exempt natur nonpatent materi from the definit of a drug in section 201 g of the act fda advis that it not true that all natur materi are not drug it has been estim that about 25 percent of the drug current prescrib by physician are plant compound and that an addit 25 percent are relat to plant therefor fulli half of the drug common use can be consid plant deriv such common use drug as digitali aspirin quinidin atropin and hundr of other were onc consid herbal thus the agenc find that it cannot reli on the distinct of whether a product is natur or synthet in decid whether it is a food or a drug 3 safeti section 101 14 b 3 ii provid that to justifi a claim for a substanc that is to be consum at other than decreas level the substanc must be a food or a food ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi whose use at the level necessari to justifi a claim has been demonstr by the propon of the claim to fdas satisfact to be safe and law under the applic food safeti provis of the act the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33709 explain this show can be base on 1 a demonstr that the substanc is general recogn as safe gras within

claim to submit all the scientif data and other relev inform requir to demonstr safeti and law in accord with applic petit requir fda will withhold review of the health claim until it is satisfi on these point 18 mani comment object that the propos safeti provis are unreason a few of these comment specif assert that herbal supplement would almost univers fail the propos safeti requir becaus most herb are not gras for use as a dietari supplement are not approv food addit and are not the subject of prior sanction or are the subject of prior sanction that have been waiv furthermor the comment complain that fdas process for act on gras affirm petit is notori slow and extrem cost the comment maintain that the propos safeti requir would discourag manufactur from submit health claim petit for dietari supplement would delay the approv of such petit and could well amount to a total ban on health claim for certain dietari supplement the comment suggest that fda requir safeti determin onli for those substanc with no histori of safe use and provid that the absenc of known safeti problem will be suffici proof of safeti for substanc with a long histori of use other comment urg fda to be flexibl in it determin of safeti for substanc in dietari supplement a number of these comment stress the import of fda recogn that safeti can be determin sole through the histor use of such substanc some of the comment note that mani compon of supplement particular herb have been use for hundr or thousand of year without safeti problem the comment also note that herb are use safe throughout three fourth of the world as a princip mean of medicin the comment declar that regulatori author in great britain germani japan and mani other nation have research various herbal supplement and found them to be safe when consum at the level of use like to be contempl under a health claim petit one comment also note that inform concern accur dosag indic contraind and qualiti control measur are also avail in past edit of the us pharmacopeia and nation formulari these comment urg fda to accept all relev data on the safe use of herbal dietari supplement includ foreign studi and monograph that evid the safeti of these product one comment declar that fda is legal bound to consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state when review the safeti of herb one comment assert that fda should evalu the safeti of vitamin and miner in term of their effect on the normal popul and not on those consum with unusu condit or sensit the comment acknowledg that such consum need clear label ingredi statement as well as educ on food to deal with their problem the comment assert howev that these consum should be held respons for some degre of self protect the comment maintain that this approach is consist with the agenc polici on person with allergi to food compon a few comment assert that the safeti of a dietari supplement should be defin in term of whether or not harm may occur under the condit of use defin by the supplement label rather than in term of an arbitrari cutoff such as the rdi the comment maintain that a systemat review of all compon of dietari supplement is not necessari and suggest that the agenc undertak safeti review on a case by case basi where it believ a potenti safeti concern might exist sever comment assert that fda is not equit in it concern for the safeti of dietari supplement as compar to the safeti of other product regul by the agenc some comment assert that the safeti record of dietari supplement is far better than mani fda approv food addit such as aspartam against which accord to the comment the agenc receiv and ignor thousand of consum complaint annual other comment assert that fdas intens interest in the safeti of product would be better focus on prescript drug which are respons for over 1 2 million death annual as compar to the no or few death attribut to the consumpt of dietari supplement howev sever comment support fdas propos to requir that petition for a health claim for a substanc in a dietari supplement demonstr that the substanc is safe and law the comment agre with the agenc that such a requir is implicit in the act and that the label law in no way diminish fdas respons to ensur the safeti of food fda conclud that the preliminari requir that the safeti of a substanc be demonstr should appli to substanc in dietari supplement in the same manner that it appli to substanc in food in convent food form the amend to the act enact by the 1990 amend cannot be implement independ of the remain portion of the act see section 9 of the 1990 amend the act must be consid as a whole and fdas respons for ensur the safeti of food is explicit provid for in other section of the act see section 201 s 402 a 1 and 2 and 409 of the act as the agenc explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos the fact that the act contain such explicit safeti author is particular signific becaus the agenc will be specif author the health claim that will be made in view of this affirm action fda author of a health claim place the agenc imprimatur on the claim moreov the claim will encourag consumpt of the substanc it would be a violat of the agenc respons under the act to author a health claim about a substanc whether it be in a dietari supplement or in food in convent food form without be satisfi that the use of the substanc is safe certain fda would have almost no assur that it would be protect the public health if it permit as some comment suggest all substanc except those that are actual known to caus safeti problem to be the subject of health claim it would be a great and tragic ironi if substanc that were the subject of health claim becaus of one effect caus injuri becaus of anoth this is the situat that congress sought to avert by includ section 403 r 3 a ii in the act fdas preliminari requir is fulli consist with the principl that underli that section the fact that some herb and other ingredi of dietari supplement have been use for thousand of year doe not necessarili justifi a conclus by fda that their use under all condit is safe but it may first fda need a basi for conclud that such use was in fact without harm effect second fda need a basi for conclud that consumpt of ingredi in a supplement carri a health claim would be in amount compar to those consum safe in the past the propon of claim for such substanc are certain free to demonstr that the use of those substanc is general recogn as safe base on their common use in food prior to 1958 the agenc note howev that the use of mani of these substanc has been primarili as a drug tonic or folk remedi rather than as food see 53 fr 16544 at 16545 may 10 1988 this fact is confirm by some of the comment summar abov as drug the level and frequenc of use of these substanc may have been signific differ than the level and frequenc of use that will result from their use as food although the agenc will consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state fda still need to review data on the ident of the substanc the safeti of the substanc the use of the substanc in food the context of it use and the frequenc of use in the countri where use of the substanc occur see 50 fr 27294 at 27295 juli 2 1985 evid that anoth countri has studi the safeti of an herbal supplement and found it to be safe would certain be relev and should be submit to fda it is import howev that as much of the evid that provid the basi for the countri determin as is possibl be submit to fda although formal recognit of safeti by fda admit can be lengthi and expens such formal recognit is not requir under this preliminari requir in respond to concern rais by comment suggest that fda recogn manufactur privat gras determin the agenc state in the health claim final rule the follow concern 101 14 b 3 ii 58 fr 2478 at 2502 through 2503 fda acknowledg that the gras affirm and food addit list process can be lengthi thus fda design 101 14 b 3 ii to provid flexibl with respect to the type of show of safeti that is necessari to make a substanc elig to be the subject of a health claim gras affirm and food addit list are but two of the procedur by which a substanc may meet this preliminari requir fda intend to consid the basi of manufactur independ gras determin where such determin are submit with petit for health claim and may use it discret to accept without formal affirm the independ determin of gras where fda believ that such action would be appropri as fda point out in the previous comment howev the agenc would not be fulfil it respons under the act if it were to permit a substanc to be the subject of a health claim without satisfi itself that the use of that substanc is safe although fda will consid all manufactur independ gras determin where the basi for such determin are submit with petit for health claim the agenc advis that it will general not be possibl for fda to judg whether gras determin base on complex scientif evid are valid within the short timefram mandat under the 1990 amend for health claim petit instead agenc agreement with an independ determin that a substanc is gras will be most like where the substanc is an ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi that was in common use in food prior to januari 1 1958 in a similar context howev where such agreement occur the agreement doe not constitut gras affirm instead the histori of common use in food coupl with the fact that fda know of no reason to question the safeti of the food ingredi mean that the substanc will be treat as if it is an unlist gras substanc as provid for in 170 30 d and 182 1 a 21 cfr 170 30 d and 182 1 a in the manner provid for in the food ingredi list in 21 cfr part 182 58 fr 2478 at 2503 under this final rule this statement is fulli applic to substanc in dietari supplement the agenc believ that this polici on independ determin that a substanc is gras demonstr that fda will be flexibl in assess conform with the safeti preliminari requir fda disagre with assert that the agenc should evalu the safeti of dietari supplement in term of onli the normal popul it would be unconscion for the agenc to adopt a polici of ignor advers effect some of which could be life threaten of ani food includ dietari supplement on vulner segment of the popul furthermor there is no basi under the act for such a polici fda doe attempt howev to find the most practic solut to assur consum of a safe food suppli for exampl the agenc general doe not base safeti decis on atyp popul subgroup that will use the product where there are subgroup of consum eg consum with certain sensit that could suffer advers effect from consum the product fda may place certain restrict on the use of the product or reli on label solut such as those the agenc has use for sulfit agent and yellow 5 as a condit for it safe use rather than deni the avail of the product to the entir popul thus for all the forego reason fda is make health claim for substanc in dietari supplement like claim for ani other food subject to 101 14 b 3 ii c scientif standard 19 mani comment express concern that fda would appli the term signific scientif agreement in an unreason manner by demand too much support evid on substanc diseas relationship befor approv health claim sever comment insist that fda is misinterpret the requir for the scientif standard for food in convent food form as well as for dietari supplement the comment assert that the law doe not requir that there be signific scientif agreement that a nutrient diseas relationship has been conclus establish but onli that the statement made in a claim be support by the avail evid as an exampl one of the comment assert that the requir of the law would be fulli met by a proper qualifi label claim such as although no scientif consensus has been establish sever clinic studi suggest that daili consumpt of vitamin c as part of a well balanc diet may reduc the frequenc of cold a number of comment assert that the standard for author health claim on food are more stringent than those author the use of drug claim sever comment argu that fda is be unduli restrict by requir that manufactur perform expens random doubl blind placebo control test to prove the valid of a claim under the propos regul these comment state that such requir would deter manufactur from seek new use for herb and other substanc use in dietari supplement the comment maintain that a more lenient standard would encourag manufactur to engag in research to develop more health product the comment further assert that the dispar treatment of food and drug is especi unfair when the enorm differ in safeti factor between dietari supplement and untest prescript drug is consid some of the comment assert that fda had not been fair to date in it evalu of health claim under this standard one of these comment assert that fda had approv onli four of the ten congression propos health claim not seven as fda claim in the preambl to the propos regul some comment maintain that fda should not requir a unanim or near unanim consensus among expert in order to find that there is signific scientif agreement concern a claim a few of the comment point out that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend clear indic that such a level of agreement is not to be requir other comment urg that fda consid the requir for signific scientif agreement to be satisfi as long as there is agreement among a major of scientist familiar with the research in a given area these comment note that commission kessler offer testimoni support this interpret befor the us hous of repres subcommitte on health and the environ other comment maintain that the requir for signific scientif agreement onli requir agreement among a signific number of qualifi expert one of these comment request that fda includ a provis in the regul that the standard of signific scientif agreement is not one of unanim to prevent confus among manufactur and consum a few comment ask that fdas regul includ a provis that guarante that signific scientif agreement will be consid to have been achiev when a credibl health author particular an agenc of the us govern recommend the consumpt of a nutrient becaus of it relationship to a diseas or health relat condit one comment suggest that fda not use the phrase signific scientif agreement to evalu propos health claim despit it inclus in the languag of the 1990 amend becaus the mean of the phrase is ambigu the comment suggest that fda should simpli consid the total of public avail scientif evid to determin whether or not a particular health claim can be justifi fda disagre with assert that it is conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda doe not requir that manufactur perform control clinic trial to prove the valid of a claim to the contrari as discuss in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2506 the scientif standard for health claim is less stringent than the requir for approv of a new drug in the case of a new drug section 505 d 5 of the act 21 usc 355 d 5 state that the secretari shall refus to approv an applic for approv of such a drug where there is a lack of substanti evid that the drug will have the effect that it purport or is repres to have under the condit of use prescrib recommend or suggest in the propos label thereof section 505 d provid further that the term substanti evid mean evid consist of adequ and well control investig includ clinic investig human studi conduct in a control clinic set by expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu the effect of the drug involv the statutori term substanti evid should not be confus with the same term use by some comment to refer to more than a scintilla and less than a preponder of evid base on this statutori direct the agenc has identifi a number of characterist that are present in adequ and well control studi in 314 126 21 cfr 314 126 section 101 14 c of fda regul doe not mandat requir as stringent as those for drug in section 505 d 5 of the act section 101 14 c contain no mention of substanti evid adequ and well control investig or of clinic investig to the contrari 101 14 c contain more flexibl than the drug provis of the act becaus it provid fda with author to author claim base on scientif evid includ evid from well design studi conduct in a manner which is consist with general recogn scientif procedur and principl that there is signific agreement among expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu such claim that the claim is support by such evid section 403 r 3 b i of the act consist with this flexibl fda did not prescrib a specif set type or number of studi as be suffici to support a health claim in the health claim final rule that appli to food in convent food form in that rule the agenc advis 58 fr 2478 at 2506 that it would consid all relev data on a topic includ clinic studi epidemiolog data and anim studi in addit the 1990 amend direct fda to consid 10 nutrient diseas relationship in the januari 6 1993 final rule fda author claim with respect to seven of those 10 relationship see 58 fr 2537 2552 2622 2665 2739 2787 and 2820 in addit fda has recent propos to author claim concern an eighth folic acid and neural tube defect see 58 fr 53254 octob 14 1993 fda believ that these approv demonstr that it is not conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda agre that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend make clear that congress did not intend in call for signific scientif agreement about the support for a claim to requir that such agreement repres a full consensus among scientist the hous report ref 1 state the standard doe not requir that there be a unanim agreement among expert instead there must be a signific agreement among expert but it doe not requir that everi expert in the field approv or agre with the claim the agenc share the comment concern that a requir of consensus would mean that some valid health claim would not be author and by restrict such claim would counter congress intent that health claim support by a signific scientif agreement be made avail to consum the agenc never intend to requir that claim be support by a consensus among scientist and has not done so the agenc is sensit to the comment percept that the scientif standard particular the phrase signific scientif agreement is subject the agenc believ howev that ani standard involv the evalu of scientif evid and opinion deriv from that evid must be somewhat subject fda in propos not to defin signific agreement among expert in the novemb 27 1991 56 fr 60537 at 60548 propos note that each situat may differ with the natur of the claim substanc diseas relationship the agenc believ that in decid whether signific scientif agreement about the valid of a claim exist it is necessari to consid both the extent of agreement and the natur of the disagr on a case by case basi the hous report ref 1 make clear that congress intend the signific scientif agreement standard to be a flexibl one by point out that in review scientif studi fda may give greater weight to the studi that it find more persuas the hous report also clarifi that the overrid consider in assess whether to author a claim should be the secretari level of comfort about the valid of the claim the agenc believ that this clarif provid clear guidanc for the applic of the standard and thus it is not incorpor the chang request by the comment in the codifi languag of the regul fda doe not believ it has in ani way been unfair in it approv of health claim to date earlier in this preambl in respons to comment 2 fda explain whi certain specif health claim were not approv nevertheless the agenc statement in the dietari supplement health claim propos that it had author claim on 7 of the 10 nutrient diseas relationship is correct in the case of 3 of the relationship howev the claim were author for food rather than specif nutrient in these case as explain previous although there was suffici evid to attribut certain diseas risk reduct to the consumpt of certain food and those food are mark by signific level of the nutrient in question there was insuffici evid to attribut ani diseas risk reduct direct to consumpt of the nutrient themselv fda doe not agre that it should defin signific scientif agreement as agreement among a major of scientist familiar with the issu commission kessler statement about signific scientif agreement be 50 or 60 percent agreement were intend to show the contrast between this term and the term consensus not to provid a specif definit of signific scientif agreement there is simpli no bright line that fda can draw in this area ultim the agenc must exercis it scientif judgment arriv at after input from the scientif communiti the agenc doe not agre that signific scientif agreement should be consid to have been achiev when a credibl health author particular an agenc of the us govern recommend the consumpt of a nutrient becaus of it relationship to a diseas or health relat condit while fda recogn the signific of such recommend congress charg fda with the respons of author health claim on the food label and label nonetheless the agenc is mind of the admonit in section 403 r 4 c of the act that read if a petit for a regul under subparagraph 3 b reli on a report from an authorit scientif bodi of the unit state the secretari shall consid such report and shall justifi ani decis reject the conclus of such report accord fda is retain the requir for signific scientif agreement in this regul 20 mani comment applaud the agenc determin not to underr ani scientif evid on the basi of it cultur or geograph origin one of these comment note that the unit state is one of the most ethnic divers nation in the world and state that a studi done anywher in the world is like to be relev to at least one us subpopul a few of these comment note that some of the studi done on herbal dietari supplement have been conduct under foreign drug protocol and request assur that fda would consid such data to be part of the public avail scientif evid support prospect health claim anoth of these comment assert that the total of public avail scientif evid should includ not onli well design studi but also ethnobotan and other tradit usag inform which is often avail for herb

dietari pattern may have in affect certain diseas or health relat condit in the dietari supplement health claim propos the agenc propos that dietari supplement be subject to the same general requir that it has establish for food in convent food form in 101 14 d the agenc advis that specif refer to dietari supplement in 101 14 d are not necessari becaus fdas revis of 101 14 a 2 the definit of the term substanc to includ compon of dietari supplement will link dietari supplement to the health claim for which 101 14 d prescrib general requir 1 fda author of valid claim section 101 14 d 1 provid that when fda determin that a health claim is valid the agenc will propos a regul in subpart e of part 101 to author the use of the claim further the provis state that if the claim pertain to a

for the appear of health claim on the label of food qualifi to bear them they do not make the appear of those claim mandatori fda believ that mani manufactur will choos to includ health claim on the

comment provid no basi for the agenc to provid a differ respons to this comment than it did in the health claim final rule as explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2500 multipl use product that are both food and drug present a difficult set of compet concern for the agenc such product are like to be both an otc drug and a dietari supplement most otc drug product are develop to address some type of acut medic problem that is expect to be of short durat if the problem persist it is import that the person with the problem know that it may be more sever than he or she otherwis thought and that he or she should seek medic attent label on such product therefor includ instruct to use the product for a limit period of time and if the problem persist to seek medic intervent thus the time limit on use of the product are import to the health of the user dietari supplement on the other hand are develop for inclus in a daili diet at level that are consist with dietari use and may often be consum throughout most of a person lifetim label on dietari supplement contain no instruct for seek medic intervent or for limit the durat of consumpt of the supplement rather under the new regul dietari supplement will be abl to bear nutrient content and health claim which focus the consum attent on the advantag that consum the product will have in help the consum to maintain a healthi diet moreov where the supplement bear a health claim the claim will contain inform about how long term ingest of the supplement may promot health where dietari level and therapeut level differ as is general the case and is in fact the case with antacid and calcium supplement an appar conflict is creat when both food and drug label appear on the same product in the case of the drug label consum are given direct for use that involv high consumpt dure a limit time period in the case of the food label consum are given direct for lower consumpt with no time constraint even though label instruct may identifi those direct for food and drug use in separ locat fda is concern that consum will incorrect assum that the therapeut dosag is appropri for dietari use and that the direct for food use will undercut the warn in the drug label to seek medic care if the condit persist where the label is not proper follow signific advers consequ may result the agenc know of no broad approach that it can use to harmon a nutrient content claim or a health claim with drug label a drug that is label with instruct for use that both limit and do not limit consumpt would be misbrand under section 502 a of the act 21 usc 352 a if it fail to contain a materi fact that is how to reconcil these conflict instruct howev fda doe not believ that it would be appropri to preclud such claim under all circumst such claim may be permiss if a firm can demonstr that dual claim can be made in a manner that will neither misbrand the product nor creat a safeti problem the agenc suggest that anyon desir to make a health claim or a nutrient content claim that compli with section 403 r of the act on a product that is both a food and a drug contact the center for drug evalu and research otc complianc branch hfd 312 fda 7500 standish pl rockvill md 20855 to discuss whether it would be possibl to put such a claim on the product and still compli with the drug provis of the act g petit 27 a number of comment urg fda to streamlin it procedur for approv health claim in order that dietari supplement manufactur may includ the most current reliabl inform on their product the comment state that the inclus of such inform is critic import to dietari supplement becaus unlik food in convent food form they are consum onli for the health benefit associ with them the comment specif propos that fda add the follow paragraph to 101 70 j 4 final rule fda will within 120 day of the date of public of the propos rule issu a final rule author or prohibit the request use of the health claim 5 expedit action on certain petit if fda determin dure it initi review of the petit that it accur repres the recommend of ani agenc or depart of the us govern with public health respons or of ani other public health organ that is recogn as a credibl sourc of inform on diet and health fda will publish a propos rule author the request use of the claim no later than 60 day from the date of receipt of the petit and will issu a final rule no later than 60 day from the date of public of the propos rule the comment maintain that new provis in paragraph j 4 would correct an obvious oversight in the exist regul ie the establish of a firm deadlin for a propos rule but no firm deadlin for a final rule the comment also contend that paragraph j 5 is necessari to address fdas failur to act prompt to approv claim that are base on the recommend of public health author such as it failur to approv a health claim for folic acid in accord with the recommend of phs agenc fda advis that it failur to specifi in 101 70 j a deadlin for the public of a final rule regard the use of a propos health claim was not an oversight section 403 r 4 a i doe not requir that the agenc adher to ani deadlin for the public of a final rule while fda could establish such a timefram by regul it doe not believ that the adopt of such a requir would be prudent the comment period follow the public of propos rule is a critic step in determin whether a propos regul is appropri for adopt in the instanc of health claim regul signific inform concern the valid of the substanc diseas relationship under the propos health claim may be submit by interest parti dure the comment period also the comment period may bring to light a previous unforeseen potenti for the use of a health claim if adopt without modif to be mislead to consum or to creat serious potenti threat to the public health the agenc has no way to guarante that it will be abl to adequ resolv such problem within the suggest timefram in such instanc if face with a specif timefram fda would be forc to either deni an otherwis valid health claim petit or to approv it without erect the regulatori framework that it believ necessari to ensur that the public health is safeguard therefor fda is not adopt the suggest time limit on the issuanc of a final rule howev the agenc advis that it commit to issu final rule on health claim petit as quick as possibl consist with the issu present and the agenc avail resourc with respect to suggest for shorter timefram for certain petit fda advis that the agenc abil to meet timefram is influenc by mani factor such as work prioriti and avail of personnel fda consid the statutori timefram for assess the valid of health claim and for issu a propos regul to be extrem short given the need to evalu the total of avail scientif evid on a substanc and a diseas or a health relat condit given the agenc limit resourc it would not be practic to shorten these timefram further howev fda point out that although action on petit for most claim will requir virtual all of the time provid by the statutori timefram noth would prohibit the agenc from act in less time than the timefram provid if it is possibl to do so thus it is like that a petit for a claim on a well accept substanc diseas relationship would be review more expediti than one for which scientif agreement is not as clear 28 a few comment urg fda to consid the limit label space avail on mani dietari supplement in develop model health claim the comment state that concis model claim will provid guidanc to manufactur on how to convey health claim in succinct statement that compli with all of fdas requir and will thus help ensur that the health claim present to consum are clear and comprehens fda realiz that there is a limit to the amount of inform that can be present on a food label howev the agenc believ that it must ensur that consum understand that factor other than dietari intak of the nutrient may bear on the substanc diseas relationship given the imper of ensur consum understand of a messag that must be present in a veri limit space the agenc is face with the difficult task of determin what inform is necessari in a claim and what inform is not fda believ that it regul in subpart e of 21 cfr part 101 repres an accept balanc between the consum right to understand the full context of the claim and the manufactur concern over claim length by delin the inform that is mandatori and option in a claim fda is reliev manufactur from have to includ inform that is of tangenti import but ensur that those who wish to make a claim do so in a manner that provid a use and understand messag to consum fda advis that it will take a similar approach when provid model health claim in the futur fda also note that manufactur who are not satisfi with the model claim are free to develop their own version of the claim provid that those version includ all of the inform requir by the author regul 29 sever comment rais the issu of product specif health claim by assert that mani manufactur will be dissuad from undertak the scientif studi and other invest necessari to obtain approv of new health claim petit by the fact that approv health claim will be allow for use on all qualifi product howev a number of comment stress that in a health claim the role of the total diet should be emphas rather than the role of a specif food in risk reduct fda advis that section 403 r 1 b of the act pertain to a claim about the relationship between a nutrient and a diseas or health relat condit rather than about particular food product and such a condit while the agenc has use the term substanc in lieu of the word nutrient and has said that a substanc can be a food in do so the agenc was onli tri to cover circumst such as those present by fruit veget and grain product in which it was not possibl to identifi the specif nutrient in a broad class of food that was have the observ effect on the risk of diseas fda was not therebi includ formul product as possibl subject of health claim such product are formul to includ particular substanc becaus of the nutrit effect of those substanc thus a health claim for such a product would appropri be about the substanc in the formul product and not about the product itself in addit section 403 r 3 b iii of the act direct the agenc to requir that health claim enabl the public to understand the inform in the context of the total daili diet as explain abov fda find that to effect congress intent in pass the 1990 amend the same requir should appli to health claim made on dietari supplement fda believ that a claim that refer specif to the effect on a diseas or health relat condit result from the consumpt of a certain brand name of product would unduli emphas the import of that product and not the import of the total daili diet also such claim could impli that other brand of the same food as well as other food contain the substanc that is the subject of the claim might not have the same effect on the diseas or health relat condit and thus would be mislead under section 403 a of the act accord the agenc find that it is not appropri to approv product specif health claim 30 one comment suggest that fda provid regular month or quarter report concern newli approv health claim petit for display in the supplement section of store the comment maintain that such a list distribut by fda would increas consum confid in the claim when they appear on supplement label although fda recogn that there could be benefit to consum from such
