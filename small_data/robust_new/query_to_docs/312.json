turnov of pound 336 000 meant someth had to chang what chang was the crop drew decid to produc onli cherri tomato and thing start to look up last year was the first time for 10 year that our bank account actual enter the black for a short period said drew it soon enter the red again when drew 65 and his partner wife mavi and son paul 36 instal a pound 53 000 half acr glasshous and a pound 5

fruit veget and salad crop on two acr at the bottom of the hill in the earli 1950s in those day we work extrem hard take produc to the birmingham market at 5am three day a week said drew but life was straightforward then if you work hard and produc good crop you made a good profit as a plain countri bloke who left school at 15 it seem simpl to me how thing have chang john and mavi built glasshous and increas the number of crop they grew the busi expand natur from profit it seem amaz nowaday but we manag without borrow until 1974 he continu in that year they borrow pound 2 800 to buy the four acr on the hillsid site where their hous and main glasshous now stand we then use our newli acquir overdraft to add our biggest glasshous yet the price was pound 3 900 all seem well so we kept on put in glass and grow main lettuc and tomato in 1975 when we ad anoth big glasshous thing were still rosi and we were sometim abl to get up to 50 per cent of the glasshous cost back use govern grant it was when these grant end plus the crucial decis to put in heat which immedi ad to our overdraft by pound 30 000 that thing began to get tight howev we still manag to add anoth half acr of glass but it was the end of the 1970s and interest rate had begun to rocket we were caught repay borrow money at rate of up to 17 per cent to tri and counter this we ad chrysanthemum to our list of crop and decid to grow them in a big way we plant up to 20 000 cut a week we saw chrysanthemum as our salvat as they gave us an altern crop 48 week of the year there was healthi demand and a good good wholesal market we increas our staff and took on five full timer which ad to the overdraft by 1980 the drew had 3 1 2 acr under glass and half an acr under a polythen tunnel but thing remain far from healthi
