should be envi by iosif stalin andrey zhdanov and mikhail suslov let us explain for those who have not been reader a spark was lit becaus in two preced issu the editori staff had publish the so call version no 1 explain in a commentari here that this was obvious a hoax aim at discredit a number of major polit figur whi is the newspap publish a document which it state itself is from a question sourc becaus the provoc write regardless of the view of ani newspap is be dissemin and unfortun has becom a fact of sociopolit life follow our public numer commentari demonstr onc again how mani had version no 1 in hand were read it and were ponder what would actual take place both befor and after the warn the editori staff continu to be confid that an inform public is within it direct respons moreov this is precis the reason it exist but the anger which has been direct at us is like an echo of those distant time when the first one to bring bad news had his head chop off three week have pass sinc our public neither the public prosecutor offic nor counterintellig has been abl to answer who has been so assidu dissemin slander on a coup who has been circul it and who has been pass the anonym document from hand to hand the head of the fsk expans not given state that they have manag to find the author of the document though special effort were not requir for this the first one gleb pavlovskiy came to our editori offic himself and told us about work on the document as far as those who were interest in dissemin the fals document and spare neither time nor effort for this are concern noth is known about them it is not hard to assum that they will not want to reveal their name the simplest thing is to accus obshchaya gazeta of all the sin offici reaction to the newspap statement is strike for it inadequaci everi day in the newspap and on televis we read and see everi possibl kind of statement by all kind of extremist polit figur all of them are simpli taken into

constitut system but if a state depart believ there are reason for this anyway then it consequ assum that version no 1 is not all a pack of lie in this case reproach the newspap for spread slander misinform is even more unfair this is like accus the doctor who give an inocul against rabi of deliber spread infect what is the point of the warn given to us this is what it is next time do not take

cocker spaniel was sit in the next cage stare through the fenc look worri that florenc shes not realli upset shes just a cocker theyr onli happi when they worri we move on past the run the troubl with most peopl the proprietor went on is that they look at kennel from the human standpoint your averag dog owner want the place to have all the comfort of home like there should be a sofa in each run and
