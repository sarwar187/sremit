insert a 22 gaug needl into the mother abdomen through the uterus and into the chest caviti of the fetus and inject a lethal dose of potassium chlorid the heart stop and the fetus die in time it is absorb by the mother bodi im pro choic and im pro life tabsh tell the assembl group think of the 20 time in the past two year that he has end the live of some fetus to save other share a womb know 20 of my patient have taken home healthi babi this is whi i do it what tabsh is wrestl with on this night is what he face daili a moral and ethic disson caus by what medic scienc enabl him to do that conflict defin his rapid advanc branch of medicin perinatolog liter around birth or matern fetal medicin perinatolog turn on high risk case in which both mother and babi are the patient not one or the other it is the studi of complic pregnanc and of prenat diagnosi the wield of tool such as ultrasound also known as sonographi or amniocentesi or chorion villi sampl all of which allow one to see what is happen in the womb coupl seek the new technolog expert a rare hand among whom tabsh is promin to predict a pregnanc outcom and determin when to interven to save a fetal life or end it when to assur a success pregnanc or termin it it use to be that babi and pregnanc just happen the doctor was there to monitor thing and he or she made an appear at the decis moment interven dure the birth process

place him among the top five or six peopl in the countri in matern fetal medicin say nichola assali a found father in the field of fetal physiolog and recent retir professor of obstetr from the ucla medic school ill tell you this he doe not know what the word tire mean tabsh deliv about 100 babi and estim that he perform about 1 000 ultrasound and 500 amniocentes annual a high volum dictat by his

the field of matern fetal medicin who appoint tabsh to the faculti in januari few peopl in this field are abl to span the distanc from research to teach to patient care and i must tell you i dont know that ive ever seen anyon with such devot follow from student to senior faculti colleagu there is seem someth charismat about the guy tabsh a master of the prenat armamentarium is consid a doctor of choic by patient and peer although mani physician perform ultrasound and amniocentesi he is one of a select number of doctor author by the state to conduct the test as part of it prenat screen program the onli one of it kind in the nation he was also one of the first doctor in los angel to receiv feder approv for pioneer the use of chorion villi sampl genet test of the placenta at nine to 11 week for his part tabsh ascrib his talent to luck im good with my hand he say peer say his abil to extrapol three dimension imag from the fuzzi tv pictur produc dure ultrasound is except tabsh technic skill often translat into an aggress pursuit of the avant gard he is someth of an obstetr cowboy ride the wild frontier of medicin experi with the use of technolog to save live that would almost certain be lost if he limit himself to tradit approach medic accept protocol allow for such innov tabsh develop possibl that rule and guidelin will onli later stretch to cover see relat stori opposit most obstetrician monitor a fetuss condit with non stress test stimul the fetus and then ask the mother to report it respons but tabsh appli a less common use but more sophist and invas measur he draw blood sampl from the umbil vein to determin how much oxygen is reach the fetus often he will teach himself a procedur that hes heard describ without ever have read about it in a medic journal or have seen it done the controversi select termin are one such exampl he had heard about colleagu perform the procedur in san francisco and new york and decid to tri it himself after discuss it with a doctor whod pioneer the techniqu i talk to somebodi who gave me an idea of how it could be done he say at that time there was noth publish on the procedur i thought of all the possibl complic that could aris and saw the possibl way of prevent them in anoth case he improvis a techniqu in respons to a crisi an ultrasound pictur of twin show that one was twice the size of the other the smaller twin had start bleed into his brother through a share placenta caus the larger twin to swell and make his heart pump harder than necessari the deterior condit of the infant led tabsh to deliv the smaller one by cesarean section and leav the other in the womb as it turn out onli the larger twin surviv though tabsh had guess that the cesarean deliveri would save the smaller child life and that the larger child was at greater risk it was a never befor attempt procedur in fact befor perform the oper tabsh inform his patient that he had onli practic on sheep and other farm anim colleagu regard all this with mix feel while acknowledg that tabsh is talent and energet some view his work with caution were not remov a fetus from the uterus and leav one in say dr lawrenc platt professor of obstetr and gynecolog at usc who question tabsh evalu of the risk and benefit in decid how to handl the twin problem he is a bit of a wild man when it come to do thing say dr john william former head of prenat diagnosi at cedar sinai medic center and now director of the privat run prenat diagnost center in west los angel if he see someth as be innov he pull it off mayb hes just ahead of his time tabsh is neither a politician nor a moral philosoph his person bent is to save everi pregnanc he can so he activ pursu good outcom he see himself as a fetal advoc even if as in the case of a doom multipl pregnanc it mean destroy presum healthi fetus to do so as obstetr scienc move closer to the ideal of guarante everi woman a perfect babi tabsh is view by mani patient and doctor as a knight who will slay the dragon of uncertainti replac chanc with choic other say he is the dragon a purveyor of runaway technolog that has overtaken life greatest miracl still other in a time of rise malpractic premium obstetrician pay the highest rate in california with perinatologist at the top of the list say hes a saint theyr grate that he take on case that most doctor cant or wont handl a few day with him offer a glimps into the fastest of medic fast lane tall broad shoulder sometim dark preoccupi tabsh stride down ucla medic center newli renov hallway with a fierc intens after complet his obstetr and gynecolog resid at yale medic school in 1978 he came to ucla for a two year fellowship in perinatolog and later receiv a tenur faculti appoint as associ professor he look at home here have return in januari after three year in privat practic in some way tabsh return to ucla symbol the medic school commit to revit it sag obstetr servic which had ceas to be a leader in the field in recent year moral there had plummet and say pitkin the depart of obstetr and gynecolog was mark by a general sens of unrest tabsh for one gave up his tenur posit a rare move in academia to pursu a privat practic in 1986 but now in addit to 12 million in physic refurbish for patient care effort are under way to expand research and train opportun certain tabsh be crown with a full professorship by the univers chancellor in januari is a harbing of chang but at the moment tabsh concern are far more immedi as he stand in his self fashion bullpen between his patient who is lie on an examin tabl and his ultrasound machin she is 32 week pregnant with twin and need an amniocentesi immedi becaus she has start to go into prematur labor this will not be a tap for genet inform but one to determin whether her babi lung are matur enough for birth if not she might be given drug to forestal labor or steroid to promot lung develop in ani case the amniot fluid will be analyz for surfact a type of fat secret by well develop lung tabsh is not one for easi chitchat his bedsid manner is effici his right hand trace the surfac of her abdomen with a transduc a wand like devic that emit high frequenc sound wave that project an imag of her babi on the video monitor befor him with his left hand he punch button and knob simultan step on a floor pedal eye narrow on the monitor screen like a race car driver his bodi speak of motion swift and sure there is a membran between them though it thin he say assess the placement of the fetus while point to a blip of light on the screen the pictur resembl a satellit transmit weather map at the same time that he attend to the patient he is also train two resid and an attend physician none of whom was abl to do the procedur the day befor becaus of the babi posit in the uterus today though the babi have move suffici to allow tabsh to share his expertis with his colleagu ill tell you everyth were do he say to the woman who like some of the patient in his vari practic has receiv no prenat care dure her pregnanc now tear stream down her face though she say noth as her abdomen knot up in a ball dure anoth contract a nurs hold her hand you wont be surpris tabsh say tri to relax your do fine watch the ultrasound machin he guid a needl into the woman abdomen youll feel a littl pressur now he say sinc one of the twin is float he must wait until it has stop move befor he can extract amniot fluid it look like strong matur fluid he say eye the vial hes just fill from one twin sac his patient smile but lab test wont be forthcom for sever hour explain his everi move he shoot a blue color dye into the first twin sac to distinguish which fetus is which then he doe a second tap this time guid the plastic glove hand of a resid who is place the needl into the other twin sac as it turn out the twin lung are matur although some doctor would have found the procedur unnecessari and simpli allow the woman labor to continu tabsh reason that hes seen too mani preemi in the neonat intens care unit not to interven this way two small healthi babi are deliv that night but not all outcom are so happi back at his northridg offic in a small build sandwich between northridg communiti hospit and a shop center tabsh has a wait room cram with 12 patient wait to see him for prenat test these patient are clear nervous flip through magazin distract each is consid at risk of give birth to an abnorm child and mani have been sent by a refer physician most have had simpl blood test to measur alpha fetoprotein or afp level yield suspici result by california law all patient less than 20 week pregnant must be offer the afp test and about half are choos to have it afp is a protein produc by the fetus if the afp level is too high it rais the specter of neural tube defect such as spina bifida in which the lower end of the spinal chord fail to close proper or anencephali liter no brain if afp level are low there is a chanc of a babi have down syndrom or other chromosom anomali on the other hand suspici afp result might mean noth more than that estim gestat date are wrong or that twin are to be expect tabsh follow up examin usual both ultrasound and amniocentesi will confirm the suspicion or give these coupl babi clean bill of health if all is well they could return for period ultrasound checkup if it the bad news they will be ask to make a choic termin or continu the pregnanc although most women agre to undergo prenat test they do so believ that they will be reassur and 98 of the time they are right but when problem are detect coupl are often unprepar to decid one of the women in the wait room is a petit 20 year old the youngest patient here she is 18 week pregnant when tabsh turn on his white acuson model 128 real time ultrasound machin to examin her he winc he immedi see that there is no amniot fluid around the babi cautious he tell her that there is a problem even though she can see her babi kick and wave on the screen soon he realiz that the patient is leak amniot fluid he ask her to meet him in his offic down the hallway past the bulletin board jam with pictur of smile babi she sit in front of his desk listen in shock and in tear he tell her that he could not do an amniocentesi becaus of the lack of amniot fluid around the babi the babi is aliv he say he could see noth wrong with it but it prognosi is extrem poor without amniot fluid the fetus cannot grow it lung cannot develop and it will be grossli deform how bad she ask he cannot say exact his test can provid inform but they cannot alway offer a crystal clear understand of what it mean she will need to discuss this with her doctor he say but given his experi with such situat he say he would recommend termin the pregnanc i cannot kill my babi she say soft walk out the door in the day that follow howev she will chang her mind and opt for an abort tabsh drive back to ucla down a dreari corridor and across from a seri of door with caution radioact materi sign his ucla offic is a nondescript space a cubicl that despit carpet and a fresh coat of paint remain virtual without person there are bookshelv a desk a chalkboard and not much els save for the pictur of his four children ali dina kareem and tarek becaus he is both an intens focus technician and a doctor whose expertis help parent make life and death decis tabsh is like two peopl one is control and flinti the other is play and emot a person whom all the technolog wizardri beli that person the one with an ach empathi for patient tend to be downplay perhap to help him distanc himself from the intens emot that surround him even he overlook that side of himself at time but not alway his next patient has driven from santa barbara to see him for a second opinion she is a 32 year old housewif who exud much warmth but she can bare conceal her grief at have lost a pregnanc for the second time in 1987 she went into prematur labor and deliv a 4 pound babi who die in recent week her fetus die dure her fourth month of pregnanc now she must decid when or if she should tri again risk further heartbreak without ani assur of a healthi outcom she has come for some simpl blood test and for basic inform she ask whether the demis of both fetus was relat how could this happen again whi this is the currenc of tabsh practic the currenc of loss and of hope too he know that he can provid courag to mother who have suffer the trauma of a bad outcom or who in year past would never even have tri to becom pregnant becaus of physic problem but he also know the limit of scienc the reach of the heart doctor still do not know precis what caus thing to go wrong dure pregnanc or whi they have learn that certain factor can put women at higher risk have children later in life and high blood pressur for exampl but they have no understand of what bring those factor into play and in ani case mani women who develop problem in pregnanc dont fall into a known risk categori although the woman from santa barbara has a healthi child at home she worri what anoth pregnanc will bring there is talk of screen her for diseas but shes determin to tri again and psycholog how is she feel he ask im ok as long as i dont have to go to babi shower she say you should not conceiv in the next six month he advis the tone is more comfort than patron the mourn process last about six month your bodi may be readi but psycholog it take longer i was hope sooner she confid but that whi i came here i know you wont miss anyth dr tabsh with that he walk her to his door and awkward he say goodbi in a way that is at onc profession and person stand besid her he place an arm over her shoulder and squeez it it his version of a hug tabsh is a handsom bespectacl man with dark question eye and black hair offset by a shock of gray up front more often than not he wear a white doctor coat that bear the name of a retir ucla faculti member which he cover with a strip of adhes tape a sign both of his quirki sens of humor and of his new kid on the block posit at ucla at time he look more boyish than ani gray man ought to look at other time especi when his glass are off while he rub his eye he look monument tire ask what prompt him to becom a doctor a half smile duck across his face and he repli my mother she want a doctor in the famili brusqu though polit he grudg agre to be interview for this articl and even then schedul time for a meet prove almost imposs the onli time he would sit still long enough for an interview was when he had littl choic in an airplan on his way back from a meet those who know him best see him in stark contrast way peopl are misl by his outer core say his mentor john c hobbin professor of obstetr at yale univers medic school and a leader in the field of matern fetal medicin insid the core hes a warm loyal guy who can be quit a team player hes not a team player counter assali anoth mentor hes a loner and not an easi person to get to know to resid who have a hard time figur out when hell show up for round he is a brilliant if elus mysteri man to nurs hes a softi who sometim crouch in the corner of a room to pray befor perform a delic oper to colleagu he is diffid at time arrog but alway avail and much respect though mani worri that he is spread himself too thin to patient he is dr amnio or dr tabsh pronounc tab ish his first name khalil mean lover in arab and he say he wish peopl could pronounc it correct with the guttur ch sound use in hebrew but sinc most cannot he goe by k just k a workahol he doesnt smoke drink onli on social occas and take vacat almost never he would do without sleep too if he could although he usual sleep from 10 pm until 2 am at which point he rise without an alarm clock and catch up on medic journal read at his pacif palisad home his wife complain that hes so compuls about document everyth in patient chart that he often get home at 5 am onli to rush out the door two hour later the last movi he saw the godfath was in 1973 read novel he say is a wast of time becaus he lack the imagin to appreci them the joke circul around the medic school is how he and his wife anesthesiologist suha murad whom he met in medic school in beirut manag to produc four children given his obsess work habit tabsh son of a steel import was born in lebanon and is a citizen of saudi arabia but he say he plan to becom an american citizen one day he was born a muslim attend protest school in beirut and send his children to cathol school in brentwood he say he believ all religion teach the same thing do no harm educ at american univers in beirut where he earn his bachelor degre and went to medic school tabsh left lebanon in 1975 soon after the civil war broke out there to attend yale upon complet his resid in new haven he return to beirut and last all of one week find it too unsaf to stay although he still adher to some patriarch valu of the middl east such as want his wife to be home with his children rather than work full time he accept a differ realiti the coupl conflict work schedul preclud their spend much time togeth two nanni take care of their children but his wife say they at least talk on the telephon everi night the american way of communic we dont have she add k wont come and tell me anyth especi about work we surviv with an understand an american woman would have divorc him a long time ago the dilemma doctor like k tabsh now face daili are inextric link to abort prenat diagnosi after all is the onli type of medic diagnosi in which a possibl result is intent death for that reason abort is a central issu but tabsh adam downplay it signific the aim of prenat diagnosi is not abort he say the aim is diagnos malform and abnorm so patient can be prepar for a bad outcom psycholog and physic decid what to do in the case of a bad outcom is never easi though some case are more clear cut than other sure candid for abort are the most sever abnorm such as anencephali or the disastr inherit metabol and chromosom diseas such as tay sach diseas and trisomi 13 and 18 in which an extra chromosom produc sever retard and babi who frequent dont live longer than one year but becaus prenat screen cannot predict the sever of a defect such as down syndrom mani coupl are thrown into a moral quagmir some children with down lead fair normal happi live and some suffer a lifetim of chronic disabl creat enorm hardship on their famili when face with a diagnosi of down 91 of coupl in california elect abort accord to the most recent data compil by the state depart of health servic tabsh posit on abort is clear it is a patient right to decid but sometim that rhetor give way to his feel about the grim realiti of second trimest abort when you do a d and e dilat and elimin it a gross procedur he say you grab the babi and pull the babi out your pull arm and leg the babi come out in piec it a sicken procedur person he doe not perform abort as part of his practic except for select termin of multipl pregnanc which usual involv far less develop fetus he distinguish the two type of abort say second trimest procedur are use to end an unwant pregnanc wherea his select termin are save a desper want infant but what of the patient who simpli doesnt want to carri twin or a coupl that decid to termin a triplet base on sex his own ethic dictat that he will not reveal the sex of a fetus nor reduc healthi twin to singleton and like other doctor perform pregnanc reduct he leav the woman with twin whenev possibl he say he doe it part becaus it leav a margin for error and part becaus he want to save everi normal fetus that he can triplet pregnanc are in a gray area becaus medic data is scant tabsh has deliv some healthi triplet but has also seen mani suffer from prematur final the patient and her famili must decid whether to choos abort he say i dont decid these thing he explain if it were up to me id probabl decid against it im just a technician tabsh follow one other ground rule befor perform the procedur at northridg hospit a ucla affili hospit he has taken the unpreced step of insist that patient meet with the hospit ethic committe to ensur a fulli inform consent the first doctor who perform select termin did so dure the second trimest to abort one of a pair of fetal twin afflict with down syndrom now the stake are chang when the procedur is done to reduc the number of fetus it is done earli in the pregnanc befor it is possibl to detect genet anomali that creat new worri after he termin one fetus in a set of triplet not long ago lab test reveal that the abort triplet had down syndrom it could have gone the other way im sure one day somebodi go to termin a normal babi and leav an abnorm one behind tabsh say it one of the problem we face with this procedur for both patient and doctor the moral ambigu linger long after an irrevers decis is made and both find way to live with the question that will not be put to rest debbi embre 33 a former patient of tabsh who help creat a support group for patient face such decis was carri twin when tabsh discov that one of them was suffer from hydrocephalus at 23 week if the affect twin continu to grow tabsh told her it could stunt the growth of the healthi one on the other hand termin the babi with hydrocephalus could traumat the other and result in lose both babi the legal cutoff for an abort was day away and she and her husband had to decid over the weekend whether to agre to a select termin we said to dr tabsh help us decid she recal he said you and your husband have to make the decis and i realli appreci that he doesnt inflict moral valu on patient the embre elect termin for twin a twin b was born just two week later weigh in at a scant 1 pound 15 ounc she was name in honor of the physician who deliv her after end the life of her sister erica tabsh embre is now a healthi 2 year old debbi embre often warn peopl who are consid a termin that there is residu pain ill be at the mall now and see twin ill get that trigger insid it can hurt that babi was mine and i griev for her but when the time is right she plan on tell her daughter about her start in life and she will show her the ultrasound pictur taken in utero of twin who share bloodlin tabsh world is fill with the pain and joy of hundr of parent like the embre almost everi day you have to break bad news to one of these patient he say draw a deep breath it a catastroph when you tell a patient your babi has anomali and some of these anomali are not compat with life but sometim some come in with a problem and end up deliv a healthi babi and that my reward no doubt the sweetest reward came with the birth of one of his own children when his wife was pregnant with their fourth child the amniocentesi result were normal but 24 week into her pregnanc tabsh turn on his ultrasound machin to take a peek and what he saw worri him it was a tini bubbl later diagnos as a bowel obstruct but he knew the defect could be correct surgic after deliveri the ultrasound exam allow them to make arrang with specialist for surgeri soon after birth without it tarek their nintendo love 4 year old might not be aliv today for

monday through friday the text of the guidelin follow guidelin on detect of toxic to reproduct for medic product 1 introduct 11 purpos of the guidelin there is a consider overlap in the methodolog that could be use to test chemic and medicin product for potenti reproduct toxic as a first step to use this wider methodolog for effici test this guidelin attempt to consolid a strategi base on studi design current in use for test of medicin product it should encourag the full assess on the safeti of chemic on the develop of the offspr it is perceiv that test in which anim are treat dure defin stage of reproduct better reflect human exposur to medicin product and allow more specif identif of stage at risk while this approach may be use for most medicin long term exposur to low dose doe occur and may be repres better by a one or two generat studi approach the actual test strategi should be determin by anticip drug use especi in relat to reproduct the form of the substanc and rout s of administr intend for human and make use of ani exist data on toxic pharmacodynam kinet and similar to other compound in structur activ to employ this concept success flexibl is need note 1 no guidelin can provid suffici inform to cover all possibl case all person involv should be will to discuss and consid variat in test strategi accord to the state of the art and ethic standard in human and anim experiment area where more basic research would be use for optim of test design are male fertil assess and kinet and metabol in pregnant lactat anim 12 aim of studi the aim of reproduct toxic studi is to reveal ani effect of one or more activ substanc s on mammalian reproduct for this purpos both the investig and the interpret of the result should be relat to all other pharmacolog and toxicolog data avail to determin whether potenti reproduct risk to human are greater lesser or equal to those pose by other toxicolog manifest further repeat dose toxic studi can provid import inform regard potenti effect on reproduct particular male fertil to extrapol the result to human assess the relev data on like human exposur compar kinet and mechan of reproduct toxic may be help the combin of studi select should allow exposur of matur adult and all stage of develop from concept to sexual matur to allow detect of immedi and latent effect of exposur observ should be continu through one

the natur of the respons have to be design on a case by case basi note 3 the rational for the set of studi chosen should be given and should includ an explan for the choic of dosag studi should be plan accord to the state of the art and take into account preexist knowledg of class relat effect on reproduct they should avoid suffer and should use the minimum number of anim necessari to achiev the overal object if a preliminari studi is perform the result should be consid and discuss in the overal evalu note 4 2 anim criteria the anim use should be well defin with respect to their health fertil fecund preval of abnorm embryofet death and the consist they display from studi to studi within and between studi anim should be of compar age weight and pariti at the start the easiest way to fulfil these criteria is to use anim that are young matur adult at the time of mate with the femal be virgin 21 select and number of speci studi should be conduct in mammalian speci it is general desir to use the same speci and strain as in other toxicolog studi reason for use rat as the predomin rodent speci are practic compar with other result obtain in this speci and the larg amount of background knowledg accumul in embryotox studi onli a second mammalian speci tradit has been requir the rabbit be the prefer choic as a nonrod reason for use rabbit in embryotox studi includ the extens background knowledg that has accumul as well as avail and practic where the rabbit is unsuit an altern nonrod or a second rodent speci may be accept and should be consid on a case by case basi note 5 22 other test system other test system are consid to be ani develop mammalian and nonmammalian cell system tissu organ or organ cultur develop independ in vitro or in vivo integr with whole anim studi either for prioriti select within homolog seri or as secondari investig to elucid mechan of action these system can provid invalu inform and indirect reduc the number of anim use in experiment howev they lack the complex of the development process and the dynam interchang between the matern and the develop organ these system cannot provid assur of the absenc of effect nor provid perspect in respect of risk exposur in short there are no altern test system to whole anim current avail for reproduct toxic test with the aim set out in the introduct note 6 3 general recommend concern treatment 31 dosag select of dosag is one of the most critic issu in design of the reproduct toxic studi the choic of the high dose should be base on data from all avail studi pharmacolog acut

studi dose respons may be steep and wide interv between dose would be inadvis if an analysi of dose respons relationship for the effect observ is attempt in a singl studi it is recommend to use at least three dose level and appropri control group if in doubt a fourth dose group should be ad to avoid excess dosag interv such a strategi should provid a no observ advers effect level for reproduct

it may be imposs to administ repeat dosag more than twice the human therapeut dosag for ani length of time a reduc period of treatment allow a higher dose would seem more appropri for femal consider of human exposur suggest littl or no need for exposur beyond the embryon period for dopamin agonist or compound reduc circul prolactin level femal rat are poor model the rabbit would probabl make a

detect onli by dose male for 9 to 10 week and mate them with femal inform on potenti effect on spermatogenesi can be deriv from repeat dose toxic studi this allow the investig in the fertil studi to be concentr on other more immedi caus of effect it is note that the full sequenc of spermatogenesi includ sperm matur in rat last 63 day when the avail evid or lack of it suggest that the scope of investig in the fertil studi should be increas or extend from detect to character appropri studi should be design to further character the effect note 13 411 412 413 number of anim there is veri littl

industri for genotox test purv et al 1994 has also been consid a the base set of strain use in bacteri mutat assay current guidelin for the detect of bacteri mutagen call for the inclus of sever strain to detect base substitut and frameshift point mutat the salmonella typhimurium strain cite in guidelin normal ta1535 ta1537 ta98 and ta100 will detect such chang at g c site within target histidin gene it is clear from the literatur that some mutagen carcinogen attack a t base pair preferenti eg levin 1982 wilcox et al 1990 also see note 1 therefor the standard set of strain use in bacteri mutat assay should includ strain that will detect point mutat at a t site such as s typhimurium ta102 which possess a mutat at an a t site within multipl copi of hisg gene or e coli wp2 uvra which possess an a t mutat site in the trpe gene or the same strain carri the plasmid pkm101 which carri mucab gene that enhanc error prone repair in conclus the follow base set of bacteri strain should be use for routin test the strain cite below are all s typhimurium isol unless specifi otherwis 1 ta98 2 ta100 3 ta1535 4 ta1537 or ta97 or ta97a see note 2 5 ta102 or e coli wp2 uvra or e coli wp2 uvra pkm101 b accept bone marrow test for the detect of clastogen in vivo test measur chromosom aberr in nucleat bone marrow cell in rodent can detect a wide spectrum of chang in chromosom integr these chang almost all result from breakag of one or more chromatid as the initi event breakag of chromatid can result in micronucleus format if an acentr fragment is produc therefor assay detect either chromosom aberr or micronuclei are accept for detect clastogen see note 3 micronuclei can also result from disloc of chromosom from the mitot spindl and thus micronucleus test have the potenti to detect aneugen compound in conclus the analysi of either chromosom aberr or micronuclei in bone marrow cell in vivo is accept for the detect of clastogen the accept of the peripher blood micronucleus assay as a substitut for the bone marrow micronucleus assay is be activ consid see note 4 c guidanc on the further evalu of compound give in vitro posit result compar trial have shown conclus that each in vitro test system generat both fals negat and fals posit result in relat to predict rodent carcinogen the test batteri approach is design to reduc the risk of fals negat result howev the genotox test batteri as describ will onli detect carcinogen that act primarili via a mechan involv direct genet damag such as the major of known human carcinogen accord to the result of the nation toxicolog program haseman et al 1990 and an analysi of result from test of pharmaceut and industri chemic in japan shimada 1993 approxim 15 percent of carcinogen are not detect by the common use batteri of genotox test therefor a posit result in ani assay for genotox doe not necessarili mean that the test compound pose a genotox hazard to man the follow point should be consid when assess in vitro posit result in vitro posit result that are without appar biolog relev should be exclud these includ the follow consider this list is not exhaust but is given as an aid to decisionmak i is the respons clear reproduc ii is the magnitud of the respons regard as biolog signific iii for posit respons in the presenc of a compet metabol system is in vitro metabol similar to in vivo metabol are in vitro specif metabolit induc iv can the effect be attribut to extrem cultur condit that do not occur in in vivo situat ie extrem of ph osmol etc v is the effect onli seen at extrem low surviv level vi are compound in this chemic class normal associ with posit effect in vitro are compound in this chemic class normal associ with negat effect in vivo in vivo a posit result in an in vitro test that is regard as biolog relev see previous paragraph indic that the test compound has genotox potenti an in vitro test measur the same genet endpoint should be carri out for confirm such in vitro test usual carri more signific than the compar in vitro assay ashbi 1983 thus for a compound show clastogen activ in vitro the bone marrow micronucleus or chromosom aberr assay can fulfil this role it is recogn that at present there is no valid wide use in vivo system which measur gene mutat howev in vivo gene mutat assay use endogen gene or transgen in the rat and mous are at various stage of develop and valid until these test for mutat becom accept result from other wide use in vivo test for genotox in tissu other than the bone marrow can provid valuabl addit data flexibl is desir in the choic of a second in vivo assay see note 5 in conclus where posit result have been obtain in one or more of the establish in vitro test analysi should take place on a case by case basi as describ abov and in note 5 d valid of negat in vivo test result becaus in vivo test have a pivot role in genotox test batteri it is necessari to prove adequ exposur of the target tissu this can be achiev by a clear biolog respons in the tissu in question or by toxicokinet data if adequ exposur cannot be achiev eg with compound show veri poor bioavail extens protein bind etc convent in vivo genotox test may have littl valu the follow recommend appli to bone marrow cytogenet assay if other target tissu are use similar principl should be appli for compound show posit result in ani of the in vitro test employ valid of in vivo exposur should be made by ani of the follow measur i by measur a signific chang in the proport of immatur erythrocyt among total erythrocyt in the bone marrow at the dose and sampl time use in the micronucleus test or by measur a signific reduct in mitot index for the chromosom aberr assay ii evid of bioavail of drug relat materi either by measur blood or plasma level see note 6 iii by direct measur of drug relat materi in bone marrow iv by autoradiograph assess of tissu exposur for method ii to iv assess should be made preferenti at the top dose use the same speci strain and dose rout use in the bone marrow assay if in vitro test do not show genotox potenti valid of in vivo system exposur is also need and can be achiev by ani of the method abov but can also be infer from the result of standard absorpt distribut metabol and excret adm studi in rodent e definit of the top concentr for in vitro test i high dose for nontox compound for freeli solubl nontox compound the upper treatment level are 5 mg plate for bacteria and 5 mg ml or 10 mm for mammalian cell ii desir level of cytotox most genotox carcinogen are not detect in in vitro mammalian cell genotox assay unless the concentr test induc some degre of cytotox it is also appar that at veri low surviv level mechan other than direct genotox per se can lead to posit result that are relat to cytotox and not genotox eg event associ with apoptosi endonucleas releas from lysosom etc kirkland 1992 such event are like to occur onc a certain concentr threshold is reach for a toxic compound to balanc these conflict consider the follow level of cytotox are current accept for in vitro mammalian cell test the desir level of toxic for in vitro cytogenet test use cell line is defin as greater than 50 percent inhibit of cell prolifer or cultur confluenc for lymphocyt cultur an inhibit of mitot index by greater than 50 percent is consid suffici the desir upper limit of toxic for mammalian cell mutat test should be at least 80 percent of the correspond control valu toxic can be measur either by assess of clone effici immedi after treatment suspens growth immedi after treatment or by calcul of relat total growth iii test of poor solubl compound there is some evid that dose relat genotox activ can be detect when test particular compound in the insolubl rang this is alway associ with dose relat toxic see note 7 it is possibl that solubil of a precipit is enhanc by serum in the cultur medium or in the presenc of s9 mix constitu it is also probabl that cell membran lipid can facilit absorpt of lipophil compound into cell in addit some type of mammalian cell are phagocyt eg chines hamster v79 cho and chl cell and can ingest solid particl which may subsequ dispers into the cytoplasm an insolubl compound may also contain solubl genotox impur it should also be note that some insolubl compound are administ in vivo as suspens or as particul materi heavi precipit can interfer with score the desir paramet and render control of exposur veri difficult eg where a centrifug step s is includ in a protocol to remov cell from exposur media see note 8 or render the test compound unavail to enter cell and interact with dna the follow strategi is recommend for test relat insolubl compound the recommend refer to the test articl in the cultur medium if no toxic is observ the lowest precipit concentr should be use as the top concentr if dose relat toxic or mutagen is note irrespect of solubl then the top concentr should be base on toxic as describ abov it is recogn that the desir level of cytotox may not be achiev if the extent of precipit interfer with the score of the test in all case precipit should be evalu use the nake eye f use of male femal rodent in bone marrow micronucleus test extens studi of the activ of known clastogen in the mous bone marrow micronucleus test have shown that in general male mice are more sensit than femal mice for micronucleus induct see note 9 quantit differ in sensit to micronucleus induct have been identifi between the sex but no qualit differ have been describ where mark quantit differ exist there is invari a differ in toxic between the sex if there is a clear qualit differ in metabolit between male and femal rodent then both sex should be use in the micronucleus test similar principl can be appli for other establish in vivo test see note 10 both rat and mice are deem accept for use in the bone marrow mironucleus test see note 11 in summari unless there are obvious differ in toxic or metabol between male and femal rodent male alon are suffici for use in bone marrow micronucleus test if gender specif drug are to be test the appropri sex should be use note 1 analysi of the databas held by the japanes ministri of labour on 5 526 compound and support by smaller databas held by various pharmaceut compani has shown that approxim 75 percent of the bacteri mutagen identifi are detect by e coli wp2 uvra but not by the standard set of four salmonella strain although anim carcinogen data are not avail on these compound it is like that such compound would carri the same carcinogen potenti as mutagen induc chang in the standard set of salmonella strain 2 ta1537 ta97 and ta97a contain cytosin run at the mutat sensit site within the relev target histidin loci and show similar sensit to frameshift mutagen that induc delet of base in these frameshift hotspot there was consensus agreement at the intern workshop on standard of genotox procedur melbourn 1993 gatehous et al 1994 that all three strain could be use interchang and that decis is endors here 3 as the mechan of micronucleus format are relat to those induc chromosom aberr eg hayashi et al 1984 both micronuclei and chromosom aberr can be accept as assay system to screen for clastogen induc by test compound comparison of data where both the mous micronucleus test and rat bone marrow metaphas analysi have been carri out on the same compound has shown impress correl both qualit ie detect clastogen and quantit eg determin of the lowest clastogen dose even closer correl can be expect where the data are generat in the same speci 4 the peripher blood micronucleus test in the mous use acridin orang supravit stain was introduc by hayashi et al 1990 the test has recent been the subject of a major collabor studi by the japanes collabor studi group for the micronucleus test see mutat research 1992 278 nos 2 3 the test were carri out in cd 1 mice use 23 test substanc of various mode of action peripher blood sampl from the same anim was examin 0 24 48 and 72 hour or longer after treatment as a rule one chemic was studi by 2 differ laboratori 46 laboratori took part all chemic were detect as induc of micronuclei there were quantit differ between laboratori but no qualit differ most chemic gave the greatest respons 48 hour after treatment thus the result suggest that the peripher blood assay use acridin orang supravit stain can generat reproduc and reliabl data to evalu the clastogen of chemic base on these data the melbourn workshop conclud that this assay is equival in accuraci to the bone marrow micronucleus assay 5 apart from the cytogenet assay in bone marrow cell the largest databas for in vivo assay exist for the liver unschedul dna synthesi ud assay a review of the literatur show that a combin of the liver ud test and the bone marrow micronucleus test will detect most genotox carcinogen with few fals posit result tweat 1994 unstabl genotoxin and certain aromat amin are problemat for all exist in vivo screen the choic of a second test howev should not be restrict to ud test becaus other assay may be more appropri eg 32 p post label dna strand breakag assay etc depend on the compound in question 6 the bone marrow is a well perfus tissu and it can be deduc therefor that level of drug relat materi in blood or plasma will be similar to those observ in bone marrow this is support by direct comparison of drug level in the two compart for a larg seri of differ pharmaceut although drug level are not alway the same there is suffici correl for measur in blood or plasma to be adequ for valid bone marrow exposur 7 laboratori in japan carri out genotox test have much experi in test precipit and have identifi exampl of substanc that are clear genotox onli in the precipit rang of concentr these compound includ polym and mixtur of compound some polycycl hydrocarbon some phenylen diamin heptachlor etc collabor studi with some of these compound have shown that they may be detect in the solubl rang howev it doe seem clear that genotox activ increas well into the insolubl rang a discuss of these factor is found in the report of the in vitro subgroup of the melbourn confer kirkland 1994 8 test compound in the precipit rang is problemat with respect to defin the exposur period for assay where the cell grow in suspens after the defin exposur period the cell are normal pellet by centrifug and are then resuspend in fresh medium without the test compound if a precipit is present the compound will be carri through to the later stage of the assay make control of exposur imposs if such cell are use eg human peripher lymphocyt or mous lymphoma cell it is reason to use the lowest precipit concentr as the highest concentr test 9 as the induct of micronuclei and chromosom aberr are relat it is reason to assum that the same condit can be appli for use male anim in bone marrow chromosom aberr assay the peripher blood micronucleus test has been valid onli in male rodent the collabor studi group for the micronucleus test 1992 as has the ex vivo ud test madl et al 1994 10 a detail collabor studi was carri out under the auspic of the japanes environment mutagen societi the collabor studi group for the micronucleus test 1986 this studi indic that in general male mice were more sensit than femal mice for micronucleus induct where differ were seen they

month to over seed or rese sinc the intens heat and dryness take their toll on newli sprout grass seed and water should be done not light and sever time daili but perhap two or three time a week depend on the weather do it for good long soak say 20 minut but do not allow runoff this allow the water to get down to the root to provid a deep lawn rather than a shallow one that is more vulner to

appropri edibl such as cherri tomato chard or strawberri wont be terribl time consum but if you get realli fanci your go to devot all your free time to this he warn so what doe a basic patio garden consist of for a dose of greeneri you can bring in some long planter full of shrub and hedg with pot palm some ivi and dwarf tree this will not give you a whole lot of color but it is not a whole lot of troubl either you can even rig up a drip irrig system use time releas fertil and you dont have to do anyth except come home and have a cocktail robert say with a laugh it realli isnt that hard to set up to add some reliabl color the patio garden can plant royal blue brunfelsia which bloom heavili in the spring to midsumm with purpl flower ivi geranium indian hawthorn azalea fuchsia begonia and impatien these are all perfect for the semi arid orang counti climat differ color shrub such as the shini xylosma which has light green leav for contrast can also provid ornament varieti as can the

such as spong rock redwood or orchid bark near the coast you may have to water onli onc or twice a week with an inland locat like brea four time a week may not be too much micro climat are also veri import if the pot are in direct sunlight more water is need in partial shade less plant that get a heavi dose of afternoon sun are more like to dri out than those that get morn sun for the hotter area of the counti such as the canyon marigold zenia petunia and bluefloss flower do veri well say susan brozowski color specialist at sherman garden to soften the climat the patio can be equip with trellis shade cloth or lath which allow some light but filter out the harshest sunshin shade plant such as australian tree fern or ficus tree can form a canopi for light sensit plant such as other varieti of fern to tell how often a plant need water look at the soil feel it touch it if it is moist it has enough brozowski say overwat can lead to fungus rot so if anyth underwat is best also irrig is prefer to overhead water becaus wet leav and flower can develop all kind of diseas such as powderi mildew never water bloom flower direct robert say matur plant have well develop root system that form into a ball which can get quit dens and thirsti solid root drink a lot more so you may have to fill a pot five time befor the plant has drunk it fill robert say usual you should water until it start come out the drainag hole in the bottom of the pot but this is not alway an indic that the plant has suffici water if the root ball has becom too dri and shrunk the water may be drain down the side if so the whole pot can be immers until the root ball has loosen up sinc the contain plant cannot draw nutrient from the ground frequent light fertil is recommend regular garden varieti brand can be appli everi 2 week or so to replac the nutrient that have drain away plant need more nutrient dure time of growth and bloom but less or none when they are in their dormant stage dure colder period day are shorter dure the winter and less light mean less photosynthesi and less new growth you can even kill plant by tri to forc growth with fertil or by prune dure the winter robert say but now is a good time to prune and fertil for maximum growth when a plant outgrow it contain the garden has two option shift it to anoth pot or shoulder it ie prune the root ball there actual are plant that are introvert such as the cather lili that thrive when their root are tight compact they do not take well to be move to larger quarter a good rule of thumb is to replant to a pot larg enough to leav an inch or two of fresh soil around the root mass contain can rang from redwood basket to clay ceram and plastic pot and moss line wire basket redwood is pleas to the eye but has a short life span it look good for about 1 1 2 to 2 year robert say and after 3 or 4 year it start to fall apart brozowski add saw off olivewood or oak whiskey barrel make fine home for tree dwarf and otherwis the root ball can be shoulder with a machet to get it to fit and then trim period with proper shoulder a ficus tree can thrive in a whiskey barrel which can last 5 or 6 year you can even buy caster and roll it around the patio robert suggest the metal band can be paint with rust inhibit paint and the wood can also be paint for longer life clay and ceram pot have almost unlimit life span and can be seal on the insid with a tar mixtur to hold the moistur a potteri seal glaze can be appli on the outsid to give it a shine and discourag discolor from salt buildup which give pot a musti white film that is virtual irremov all pot should have a drain hole in the bottom which is kept from get plug by placement of rock and pebbl in the bottom around the hole you can get by without drainag if you have a

the qualiti of our loan portfolio is no doubt go to get wors if peopl dont have money they simpli arent go to pay we just dont know exact how much of our portfolio is go to be in that posit dollar account for about 15 per cent of the liabil of the mexican bank system so net incom will suffer from exchang rate loss as well as from increas one time charg for bad loan but analyst say 1994 balanc

metropoli that of ancient athen itself much obscur by near 2 1 2 millenium of histori intern emin as a historian of ancient greek philosophi vlasto who recent turn 83 has pioneer current think about one of the citi state most illustri citizen socrat roam the marketplac in his well worn coat button hole merchant and youth with his insist question socrat brought philosophi from heaven to earth in the acclaim word of the roman orat cicero at a time when other thinker were either specul on the natur of the cosmos or cultiv the esoterica of metaphys socrat began his analys of human conduct and in so do help to lay the philosoph foundat of western cultur vlasto who is also greek has spent more than 30 year patient strive to better understand the idea of his countryman whose life span 70 year from approxim 470 to 399 bc the fruit of his labor are now twofold last month the octogenarian philosoph becam the recipi of a 375 000 macarthur foundat fellowship award for creativ endeavor by the john d and catherin t macarthur foundat and in the process tie two former winner for the record of oldest honore in addit next spring his scholar explor will culmin in the public of his book socrat ironist and moral philosoph cornel univers press and cambridg univers press in england accord to specialist in ancient greek philosophi vlasto like socrat has done much to human the field at a time when emphasi is be place on the logic valid of argument rather than the substanc of thought he has shown that philosophi can speak with a public voic and address problem that are of concern to everyon say alexand nehamus professor of philosophi at princeton univers and a former student of vlasto along with british philosoph gel owen vlasto say nehamus establish greek philosophi as a serious field of studi in america previous philosophi in america was unhistor and concern more with solv contemporari problem vlasto show there was relev in the solut of problem bequeath by ancient philosoph he say in the 1950s vlasto form the general accept view of socrat as a negat thinker who point out contradict in other peopl think say nehamus his new book he believ is go to chang the way socrat is be seen within philosophi it vlasto revis vlasto but at the same time it vlasto revis common sens becaus what he thought about socrat for the past 30 year came to be what everybodi thought about socrat vlasto who regret that scholar have come to depict socrat as a dull moralist now present a dynam posit figur whose view had a charismat influenc on the youth of his time and have an immedi relationship to our own in the late 20th centuri he would be a brilliant debunk of hocus pocus in issu of public moral we could use a whole platoon of peopl like socrat say vlasto who bear on his cane to eas himself into a live room chair suffer from bone cancer which has left him frail he nonetheless speak forc with the sort of fearless assert and brisk iron gust of humor that are said to have character socrat the most import singl thing about socrat is his insist on clear think say vlasto there a tremend amount of fuzzi think today particular on the topic of moral which allow ecclesiast dogma to be slip in on us like the question of contracept and abort vlasto who attack anti abort argument with alacr find the idea that a fertil ovum within a day of it fertil is a person is simpli absurd compound the wrong of reason he say is the fact that this dogma has been foist off on a nation whose constitut proclaim the separ of church and state socrat would have had a field day point out these absurd he declar as the critic of the public conscienc socrat say vlasto would have a plate of issu on which to speak donald trump he would realli press him as to whether he can find happi by pile up endless quantiti of money and possess the slash of fund from social servic and concurr support for militari defens the onli way we appli modern technolog which can produc unlimit quantiti of wealth is by run into militari crise and then divert vast amount of money to the product of illth which is the opposit of wealth the ethic of the ronald reagan era he was a great joker he had no compass for other less fortun than himself these are the kind of question socrat love to address vlasto state the problem which real human be have to face in real life furthermor the media would give him the opportun to reach an audienc of million rather than a scatter of individu socrat would be a prime subject for tv talk show say vlasto he had someth of substanc to say and he would say it with wit and ironi and fearless the most import moral lesson that socrat taught and one to which socrat student have not previous given proper attent vlasto believ is his reject of the principl of retali an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was a veri well establish principl of moral in greec he say far stronger than it is in today societi with greek common supplic the god to take vengeanc on their foe yet socrat held that if your onli reason for hurt someon is that that person did a nasti thing to you that is total unjustifi vlasto say this is the principl that wrought havoc in the ancient world set athen and sparta in a near 30 year war of retali similar it was to refut the principl of retali that socrat who was sentenc to death for impieti and the corrupt of the citi youth chose to drink the poison hemlock the state method of inflict death rather than accept the escap from prison that his friend had prepar the argument that was made to him was the athenian have done you dirt theyv condemn you unjust so you should feel free to do whatev is most advantag to your person safeti say vlasto instead socrat obey the law punish of the citi which he recogn had allow him the freedom to question tradit platitud for most of his life a freedom he would not have enjoy in sparta it is such an act of integr that separ socrat from american notabl of our day vlasto think although there are some celebr thinker he find peopl with true integr are quit rare in our societi i cant think of a contemporari socrat his style was in diametr opposit to popular contemporari celebr consid ugli by greek standard of aesthet he was slight pop eye and snub nose with larg flare nostril the better to take in fresh air he would joke vlasto say though as his pupil plato wrote he was all glorious within and rather than trumpet his import say vlasto he was alway run himself down in some way he invent ironi vlasto say hed come up to you and say oh you look like a veri wise ladi to me now what do you think about this and that and pretti soon it would appear that your wisdom was a littl bit over rate he was suspici of polit refus to becom entangl with wealth and felt his life mission command by god was to examin himself and provok self examin among the citizen of athen he use languag with strike virtuos engag young men in debat on the bench of the citi gymnasia at the same time that they develop their physic power but if socrat flourish as a conspicu celebr vlasto point out it was becaus he was part and parcel of a societi in which intellectu prowess was high prize the word and the act of philosoph as it is known in western civil are greek in origin as is the idea that fundament principl are all suscept to ration critic all of them vlasto say the greek had a much liveli intellect than appear in our young peopl whose mind are stupefi by tv and other essenti passiv entertain which dont call on them to exert their mind the general atmospher of the age is not critic in our societi we have this success bug consequ vlasto say one adopt the convent sign of good behavior and becom veri wari of depart from establish habit this in turn result in the fact that peopl are buffalo by all these uncrit dogma which vlasto think is the sourc of so mani of our problem today vlasto own critic thought was form at an earli age in the particular socrat manner of one on one tutor which he

constitu of nucleic acid are known to be acut toxic by themselv but like protein and other normal constitu in food may caus indirect advers metabol effect if consum exclus at high dose over a long

calendar i have plant perenni in big red letter next to the month of march this is becaus i have such success plant them at this time of the year true they can be plant at just about ani time in the fall winter or spring but in march they wast no time in becom someth they grow fast and strong and seem to bloom almost instant they do not do this all of their own i do spend a great deal of time and effort prepar the soil dig it up and mix in organ amend and hand of granular fertil and i water quit often for the first month but they quick take hold and are soon establish and readi to flower the peak of flower come in may a glorious month and continu into june and i make sure to plant some perenni that will bloom in summer and even in earli fall onc establish they take littl work i fertil everi coupl of month and water about onc a week or less plan your water if the water has you worri becaus of the continu drought and the chanc of ration this summer consid that perenni tend to need less water than most annual and certain less than a lawn which is one reason i convert part of my lawn to an expand perenni bed if this knowledg doesnt assuag your concern consid plant perenni in one compact area where they can be water while the rest of the shrub and tree in the garden learn to get by on less most can and a bed of perenni is certain worth pamper i would set asid this area for perenni flower becaus they are such a delight to grow though they seldom flower as long or as profus as annual while most annual bed plant are neat and tidi and veri uniform perenni tend to be more vari undisciplin and wild in appear but their varieti and exuber can be delight and often surpris but plant perenni is not a sure thing some perenni are turkey bloom poor or grow weak so let me suggest some to plant now that are not while i am at it let me also suggest some strategi the idea as i see it is to take advantag of the tremend varieti avail and contrast one kind against anoth to contrast height foliag color or form big leav against littl while the flower color bring the harmoni fast grower for instanc lychni coronaria alba is one extrem a low grow tidi clump of fuzzi gray green leav that will spread in time to about two or even three feet across but never grow abov six inch high except when it flower the small white flower come on slender spike two or more feet tall obvious a plant this low with such except foliag belong up front in the plant scheme the fact that the flower spike are so much taller add a littl unregi spice to the scheme if you have troubl find this perenni tri anoth that look much like it lamb ear lamb ear has even prettier foliag though it is not as long live look poor all winter and last about two year befor need to be replac in compens it grow veri fast spread to three feet by the end of the season it too has flower spike but they are onli two feet tall with near invis pink flower i usual cut them off prefer foliag alon add contrast now for a littl contrast tri that common perenni columbin just behind and off to the side of either the lamb ear or the lychni columbin has leav that pick up the gray in the other two but the effect is of contrast becaus the plant is tall and airi instead of low and dens flower bloom off and on all spring and summer and are love pastel hue on three foot stem start with good size plant as columbin grow slow anoth plant that contrast well is the blue bed salvia salvia farinacea a perenni often grown as if it were an annual it grow a littl over a foot tall and just as wide with slender spike of purpl in my own garden these four perenni grow in front of rose but to either side i plant perenni that colon they spread to form good size thicket one of these is the doubl flower shasta daisi name esther read that grow to about two feet tall and the other is physostegia which grow to about three feet tall shasta daisi the shasta daisi becom the mainstay of the garden in june bloom along with dwarf agapanthus which while common are except perenni nonetheless the physostegia carri the garden into earli fall bloom at that time the shasta daisi add the leaven effect of white to the garden while the physostegia add pink or purpl both are what i call colon perenni becaus they spread underground to make small forest of stem space small plant about a foot apart and they will fill in by summer end each year in winter some must be pull out to keep everyth in bound and to keep them out of the rose these two perenni are veri linear and upright so an appropri contrast would be someth round and bushi if you like bright golden yellow you will find this contrast plus flower all summer and fall in the coreopsi name earli sunris singl flower or sunray doubl flower both make bushi ball of bright green foliag about two feet across and are smother with flower behind all this you can see that a perenni bed must be deep as wide as six or eight feet i plant tower delphinium the subject of last week column and japanes anemon the anemon go where the bed becom shadi and in my garden grow to about two feet tall and send up flower in the fall on spike four to five feet flower are white or a light purpl or pink in less common varieti of japanes anemon i alway stick in some root of liatri or gayfeath which are avail in the bulb section at nurseri now gayfeath make three foot spike of

go to grow ani in the immedi futur this mean we have to count on our own strength to a consider degre what strength are these you cant send soldier out into the field there arent enough of them for

done in mani of the district and of cours you cant get anyth done without order and execut disciplin anoth obstacl today is the outsid crimin racket are make their way into the militari sovkhoz

violat the ministri of defens ministri of intern affair and ministri of secur also have subdepartment servic the main thing that alarm us is that our committe doe not overse the enterpris of the

sanitari epidemiolog servic independ do not take offens but will it realli be more comfort and easier for the specialist under the it wing belyayev you have touch upon the most difficult question in the develop of our servic for year quiet submiss obsequi director have been select and have learn to work in the bureaucrat style in order to pardon the express surviv and remain in their job in the veri same meat combin there is the technolog the critic below and the unsanitari all around and they ask the sanitari inspector what do you want the public to go without meat put yourself in our posit we must feed the peopl and not shut down product as you are prescrib builder deliv home with unfinish work offer the same argument that is whi some sanitari inspector practic never make use of their right to shut down harm or unsanitari product it is veri difficult for our servic director to chang their psycholog they do not want to fight they do not want to it is veri difficult for sanitari inspector to break the habit of put themselv into somebodi posit i have alreadi said that not everyon has been abl to chang his ideolog and get over the old system under the new condit but i also want to mention that we have mani exampl where servic director have made decis base on principl they have made full use of their right to halt violat of public health legisl for exampl there are the moscow perm sverdlovsk orenburg and mani other republ kray and oblast servic lukyanova the press has report inform about the fact that foreign athlet and businessperson especi artist have brought their own

believ emot characterist of male such as larger skeleton facial and bodi hair babi and toddler are of cours much more complic than fetus and more suscept to expect from parent and other so it get

realli dont know what were talk about the seem incess test that goe on in a child school life has produc a wealth of data for gender research but interpret of that data can prove controversi in the past and in veri general term male perform better than femal on math test while the revers was true on verbal test but recent research indic the gap has narrow although it has remain signific in math score and has virtual disappear in verbal score the reason for this are complex and still open to specul expert have point to biolog and sociolog factor that may come into play some believ for exampl that the brain is special with the left brain respons for languag and the right brain respons for nonverb or spatial skill left handed which is believ to correl to right brain domin is more preval in male lead to specul that that may be whi male general do better in math and spatial skill test but more attent has been focus on the differ signal that parent and teacher send to boy and girl in educ

introduc this year these regist a pig number on the comput when it pass through weigh scale farmer can pick up the pig number with an electron wand tap addit inform on that pig into a hand held comput these detail can follow the anim through the slaughterhous to the supermarket shelf allow the consum access to a varieti of inform about the way the pig was rais pig breeder are also take their first

also start a joint initi to sponsor research into how the inform on gene can be appli for exampl they want to isol the seri of gene respons for reproduct this will allow breeder to increas litter size curti say he has bred a meishan superpig capabl of produc 40 piglet a year against a nation averag of rough 21 it would take us about 10 year to get to a point where we are produc 40 pig a year at a

although weidlein point out that other water qualiti factor also could be import his greatest fear is that someon might illeg introduc bass back into the lake upset the delic balanc it would be a

edit water wise right now halfway through the fourth year of drought peopl are be forc to think about water and how they use it in the garden it import to save water now just in case the rain dont return in the fall and we face an unpreced fifth year of drought but even should it pour there are some veri good reason for us to learn some new way with water reason no 1 is cost even if it rain for week even if more water is divert to urban area which at present onli get 16 of the state water with 4 go to landscap irrig even if new dam and aqueduct are built high unlik water will cost more in the near futur it get the water to southern california that expens and water save plant system and techniqu do save money in a test conduct by john olaf nelson of the north marin water district in northern california compar small tradit lawn domin garden to small water conserv garden the water wise garden net a save of 54 on the water bill they also turn up some hidden save a 24 save on labor 61 on fertil cost and 22 on herbicid use becaus these were small condominium garden the total save each year averag onli about 75 but the dollar amount would be much greater in grander garden reason no 2 might be the weather scientist think that the weather will be more errat for the forese futur and drought as well as wet year more like they point out that the weather most of us grew up with in the 1940s 50s and 60s was unusu mild and consist so forget the good old day water could be scarc at ani time and the wise will be prepar reason no 3 is the govern garden who are unprepar might find themselv forc to learn a few new way as some have discov this summer govern is not sit idl by but is busi propos or implement ordin that regul how water is use in the garden pend state legisl assembl bill 325 will mandat that communiti come up with water save landscap ordin most of the water save plan now in effect were develop by water district after legisl six year ago requir them to come up with plan at the moment most ordin in california citi are quit reason limit when you can water or at the most how much you can water but in the wing are propos that tell you what kind of irrig equip you can use and even what plant you can grow plant list are the greatest threat they would tell garden and nurseri what they can or cannot grow say landscap architect lisa iwata one of the organ of the annual xeriscap confer in southern california which promot water conserv garden plant list are scari reason no 4 is chang aesthet this may turn out to be a fad or fashion but at the moment the bright green garden base on and around a larg expans of lawn is out there is a new aesthet in california garden and it is a leaner sunnier look lawn do not domin this look and are often absent instead there are path and patio ground cover mulch and lot of shrub and perenni that are not bright green but oliv green or gray green it is not entir clear if these garden are factual more frugal with water but peopl do water them less and typic with someth other than sprinkler in the north marin studi there was a definit water save of 54 in water conserv garden but most of this was attribut to the lack of a lawn and the grass grown in this part of northern california tend to be the thirsti kind bluegrass rye and fescu not the more drought toler warm season grass preval in southern california reason no 5 is just for the fun of it some of us might resist the new way and new technolog garden is after all a pleasant repast from the techno world we live in just you and the soil work togeth to make thing grow hand in the dirt thumb clamp over the hose but these new way and new technolog can be fun so much so that they can becom a hobbi of their own now when it get too dark to be out in the garden you can pour over brochur leaflet and catalogu studi and learn neighbor and friend will seek you out for your new found wisdom and new way youll know what et evapotranspir is and that a tortuous path is not the pacif coast highway on a good beach day a tortuous path is a new way of prevent drip system from clog youll be abl to speak of precipit rate and polym you may even be abl to convers about comput in the garden becaus they are come avid garden can give you a few more reason to find some new way with water flower that fall over from the weight of water droplet on their leav or blossom diseas on rose and other plant and even some common pest plant that are too tall and need stake young tree that blow down dure santa ana wind plant that die soon after plant or sever year later from root rot these common garden problem can be solv or at least mitig if you adopt some of these new way with water are garden and garden practic about to chang dramat probabl not or at least not immedi lawn are sure to shrink in size and alreadi are santa barbara nurseryman ray sodomka call them the new littl lawn as peopl discov the pleasur of grow other thing in their place but there

water use to hose down driveway or sidewalk may be wast although some now question if use deafen leaf blower to redistribut dirt and pollut they simpli settl somewher els is a wise water save tactic here howev govern has alreadi act and ban the hose down of sidewalk and driveway but water that goe to plant is definit not wast it is a renew resourc after all and water the garden is not an evil act

osvaldo are there indic of an econom recoveri and if so in which sector are these indic emerg at this moment rodriguez well first i want to tell you carlo that straight talk has alreadi made some predict for this year 1994 for the begin of the year to be exact on make those predict we said that this year 1994 was the year when some symptom of econom recoveri would be emerg they would be modest symptom as you said but recoveri after all at this moment we cannot yet talk about econom reactiv i think we can onli talk about symptom of econom reactiv becaus so far some area which have been declin word indistinct of the steelwork industri sime which in 1993 announc that it manag to stop it declin and even manag to pick up somewhat but this show that compar to 1992 there is a recoveri let us consid tourism tourism is today the most stabl sector of our economi it is a sector that has been grow on a year basi with net and gross incom i also think that tourism is have a domino effect on the rest of the economi whi well becaus the tourism industri demand a number of resourc that the countri itself can suppli today these resourc are sought abroad this forc the cuban economi to divert it merchandis toward tourism i was also talk about the steelwork industri this industri has strong invest dedic exclus to tourism but not onli the steelwork industri agricultur must also seek strong invest and suffici product in order to meet all the need of tourism and in addit to this there must be other servic such as launder dri clean water suppli system electr line etc all these thing ensur that the gross tourism incom is redistribut among the rest of the economi santana doe this mean that you see tourism as the sector that is show sign of reactiv rodriguez well tourism in itself is a sector where santana interrupt i am ask this question osvaldo becaus i would not mention tourism as a sector of reactiv but as a fulli consolid branch rodriguez well both thing it is a branch that is consolid itself but in relat to the nation economi grow tourism is a sign of econom reactiv becaus it is onli a sector which togeth with petroleum has been expand all these past year includ these recent crisi year i am happi to rememb the case of petroleum becaus i have almost forgotten the effort made by the petroleum worker the fact that our countri extract 100 000 ton of petroleum last year is anoth symptom of the economi reactiv but this year the work be carri out with some foreign compani name through the so call risk contract must also begin yield result noth has been announc so far but they have been work for a littl more than a year look for petroleum santana suppos we have to make an anlysi of those sector which do you think is most respons for that econom reactiv or at least which do you think is the most import rodriguez well unquestion the sugar industri is the most import of all but the most repres of econom reactiv as i said befor is tourism i have explain the reason for this and i am now go to explain whi the sugar industri is the most import the sugar industri is what has alway maintain the cuban economi what has yield the most import fruit both for the current foreign trade structur and for the previous structur when the socialist bloc was still in effect when our most import sale to the world market includ to the cema market had been by the sugar industri the sugar industri seen in it broadest sens produc not onli sugar but also alcohol molass other byproduct such as bagass now the medicin the cattl feed and mani other product result from the sugar industri but today we are face an energi crisi in addit to the great crisi energi or the lack of petroleum is what has led us to this profound crisi cane has therefor also becom our petroleum i think therefor that we must be care when deal with the sugar industri becaus the futur of cuba must be the sugar industri futur cuba cannot dream of a futur that is not the sugar industri even though we might find a larg petroleum deposit sugar will alway be the sourc of all the thing i have mention santana yes sugarcan is consid the econom activ that can help us most under the current circumst howev is this hope justifi rodriguez of cours there is the sugarcan recoveri program we have to keep in mind that our field have been high exploit which make the soil lose it fertil it is therefor necessari to fertil the land use for sugarcan the lack of fertil first and the lack of herbicid second have result in a signific drop in sugarcan product this hope is justifi becaus we are veri serious work in the recoveri program today the main goal of the basic cooper product unit ubpc is to restor sugarcan product to former level whenev sugarcan product is restor the harvest will of cours regain it rate which had been stabil at the 8 ton mark we have to return to that level of harvest santana you also spoke of the steelwork industri i am still not clear you spoke about this industri in light of the import of product of equip for other industri rodriguez for other industri paus the steelwork industri is capabl of build mill and also mani other type of equip it is capabl of manufactur pump signific invest are be made this industri put out a consider amount of electr and telephon cabl it is also a great provid of spare part it is a tremend produc of steel not onli carbon steel but also stainless steel which is now produc in cuba i believ that the potenti of this industri which has taken year to shape this is not someth done overnight is mark by the special of it worker technician and engin this allow us to use this industri to develop the countri and also as a sourc of export santana onc again on tourism i understand that cuban tourism has perform favor in term of intern market in recent month is this true what do you know about it rodriguez yes i have read about this issu i believ it is veri interest that cuba is alreadi be seen extens by tourist in the caribbean basin it is predict that by the end of the centuri the caribbean will be the world top spot for tourism cuba is not compet with mani caribbean island today there are veri small caribbean island perhap slight larger than the isl of youth that welcom 1 million tourist we are begin to develop we began tourism late we must rememb that it is difficult to reduc that distanc of cours we must keep the us blockad in mind the greatest number of cruis ship in the caribbean and around cuba transport approxim 8 million tourist are base in miami these are american busi the blockad ban all those ship although they skirt everi cuban coast without touch cuban port this undoubt affect us serious i believ that despit this tourism is arriv we have mani european particular german and canadian as heard tourist latin american tourism is also begin to increas i believ that this will fulfil those predict that cuba will welcom 1 million tourist santana in what measur is this reactiv the result of the open to certain foreign capit invest on one hand and on the other the result of the increas in our product and qualiti in the econom effort base on effici and control rodriguez i believ it is a combin of all these thing the foreign capit invest has allow us first of all to access market access technolog and capit this is the case with tourism we said that tourism is one of the model industri of this reactiv foreign capit not onli form part of the tourism industri it also play a role in reactiv other import industri within cuba i believ this has play a role undoubt the increas awar of cuban worker better yet the collect of the need to perform more effici work better and even come to believ that the product must be consum immedi and not be produc to be store away and with poor qualiti becom awar of all these thing has result in higher effici which today cannot yet be seen in ani plan becaus the cuban economi has just complet the process of declin santana how can we guarante the

and learn to work with high level of effici econom and use true econom control there is no need to think that a foreign is need to teach this to us i believ we have foreign here teach us veri interest thing but we can also make our own contribut becaus when you speak with worker they know quit well what need to be done santana we have discuss macroeconom issu when will the reactiv be felt at home rodriguez first of all in term of nutrit i believ this is the first thing that the peopl are expect we speak of symptom and even some comrad have smile and said symptom with the need we have today i have had to explain that the econom reactiv has to take place befor the domest part of the economi will feel the reactiv the first problem at home is food i believ we have to solv this first in what measur can this be solv well this is perhap a subject for anoth program second we need to satisfi a varieti of primari need becaus this crisi has result in the lack of mani thing we could make an

it goe until the configur meet the mission requir thus the problem is both simpl and complex while such an iter process is obvious veri time consum unifi the two world of cad and engin is a real

the scientif disciplin in charg of the various calcul do not share the same represent of realiti cad specialist work on complet model veri similar to the real thing while engin use ideal structur jc amieux in fact this is a problem of multirepresent there are two way around it we can either start with the cad model and simplifi and abstract it in order to build an x number of model correspond to an x number of scientif disciplin or we can begin with simpl structur use in engin and then flesh out the model whi construct a complex cad model when the various group have not come up with a final configur yet while the second solut may appear prefer it creat anoth problem all project soon need to be express through an artist view a realist render whose purpos is the manag of interfac between satellit and launcher between box and support plate between antenna and payload plate not to mention interfac with the outsid world between matra marconi space mms and it custom between mms and it subcontractor it must also be possibl to consult with the latter at ani time dure the project howev the multirepresent problem is not as critic as in other field no one would dream of develop a consum product without know veri earli on what it will look like so there is no singl solut no matter which way is chosen each disciplin is go to stick to it own model and our task will be to manag those model and to make sure they can actual communic jc amieux explain inform technolog challeng mmss first goal was to consolid the comput environ so that all model could communic rewrit all program thousand of line of code would be neither realist nor use say jc amieux we had to come up with other solut direct connect with data structur or the use of communic standard the first approach is onli conceiv if there is access to the data structur which is easier said than done furthermor this doe not necessarili solv problem aris as part of relat with the various partner one can hard compel them to use a given softwar packag the altern rout is that of data exchang standard while it may appear an easier one it has it own set of problem some high special field have almost no standard as for those standard that do exist they are not alway standard some design use their own substandard which make transfer data from one softwar packag to anoth high peril unless again one is in touch with the design of the softwar the ideal solut would be an open and a standard of packag as wide as possibl exchang standard are sheer hell but sinc we are not lock in one place anyth goe say matra datavis market and communic director jean yves guinem who also suppli mms with packag such as euclid for the time be sinc there is no simpl solut mms has chosen one that is a compromis close link with matra datavis have led to an interconnect of the tool use by the design depart and the engin depart the tool have been made compat with the esabas european satellit model languag the result is systema a computer system which consist in a number of integr and interconnect tool and make it possibl for specialist belong to differ disciplin to talk to one anoth howev this is not a central system which a singl oper could use to design a satellit all we did was to interconnect the various depart in order to let them work togeth on the same project explain jc amieux this tool drastic reduc a satellit design time over a 10 year period mms has cut this time by half with spacecraft becom increas complex what remain to be done now is to interconnect the three integr set we have creat the tool the satellit will use to respond to it environ structur orient comput tool and cad tool say jc amieux this is one of the subsequ phase on the road to concurr engin integr from the design stage of all element of a satellit lifecycl human challeng so concurr engin is base on methodolog and tool but there is more in this concurr engin project we start with the tool if there are no tool peopl do not begin to chang their methodolog but becaus they have the tool doe not guarante they will chang methodolog thus as alway convinc peopl to chang their way take a lot of work mms has a power argument howev a critic review of the way peopl work never fail to show that they increas refus repetit and cost work transcrib a model from one standard into anoth is hard product explain jc amieux howev one basic principl must be kept in mind all this work must not be visibl to the end user who must onli think i could not do this befor and now it is both possibl and more effici let us take a project group as an exampl expert of the various disciplin use to meet in the flesh with all their paraphernalia of pen and paper now they can work togeth via the larg screen of a workstat they will have

difficult one this is an inform technolog notion an essenti one for the develop of concurr engin howev there is current no consensus as to what a singl develop environ realli is say jc amieux convent cad cam softwar packag general offer a singl work environ albeit a proprietari one develop a special modul entail call on the packag develop the problem engin want to make such tool their own we develop our concept around matra datavis euclid softwar among other but we now realiz that this was not the best approach to total integr so we talk with matra datavis and this led to a complet revers proposit the cascad softwar packag this product is an answer to singl develop environ concern it is a softwar system a tool kit through which engin will be abl to access all the tool requir in a concurr engin environ jc amieux say in fact the condit have been entir revers it is no longer a softwar packag that is be suppli but the tool necessari to put togeth the appropri system cascad also

from agricultur to the finish product food and otherwis a complex decisionmak process the delay note in set up this fourth framework program are main due to the come into forc of the maastricht treati which usher in european union on 1 novemb 1993 to provid for this delay the third framework program budget was extend in june 1993 by 900 million ecu the treati on european union consider alter the

taken the public 20 year to accept in vitro fertilis ivf and prof edward a distinguish scientist know all there is to know about controversi he has even had to sue for libel he give the impress of one

the maximum possibl freedom for scientif inquiri and the minimum of statutori intervent into what he regard as a human endeavour to satisfi a fundament human desir which is to produc children i ask him how the latest outbreak compar with the test tube babi furor there have been endless controversi all of them headlin news this is onli the latest but could i say that we start the ethic debat in the whole field in 1971 he was refer to an articl he wrote with david sharp an american academ lawyer for natur magazin there he call for elabor of the issu in order to give time for defin and evolv social attitud on which to base rule of conduct for scientist and societi some scientist i said argu their is a pure untrammel disciplin and it not for them to take the ethic decis ive never ever believ that ive alway said that in the earli stage of investig the crucial role are play by the scientist and doctor would you yourself use foetal ovari i would grow them at the present time to the stage befor fertilis he said i would want to know theyr perfect normal befor i take ani further step that will probabl take year then i would probabl fertilis some and grow them as embryo i would not transfer them into the surrog mother becaus there could be consider social backlash to this work in ani ethic debat one must alway put down a period of two to three year for social balanc to be establish the effect of mani scientif develop on societi come as a shock the yuk factor or whatev you call it would you treat singl women i would yes provid they had ethic counsel and there was detail ethic investig of their background patient usual came on referr their background known but he recal that one would be patient turn out to be a lesbian should there be an age limit prof edward quot the biblic stori of sarah and observ that the oldest artifici pregnanc to date was of a woman of 61 or 62 between 50 and 60 the medic risk to mother and child are no greater than those of a younger woman with proper care had there been medic or scientif contra indic i would have said this is out but i have not seen those contra indic it has move from be a scientif question to a social one and i feel veri strong that individu liberti here are be threaten i see no reason whi a woman of 60 should not have a babi i dont know if i would go to 70 or not i alway say ask the question when you know the work can be done should peopl be abl to choos the babi colour if they say they do not let the colour of skin affect their relationship with anybodi that they are non racist then you should not mind if a white ladi wish to have a black babi cant you see ani ethic object not realli if two white patient come and ask for a black babi i would wonder about that but if it a white man and black woman as it usual is and the colour of the child is veri obvious go to be a problem then provid they were counsel i would say veri well what about choos sex again i think i must be veri liber i do not see ani great danger in choos the sex of your children provid certain control are exercis the most serious thing that can happen is that you will get an imbal of sex as in china but the most interest aspect which is never discuss is what the children would say and feel if they knew they had been chosen as boy or girl by their parent edward himself is the father of five girl of whom two are non ident twin he would not howev seek to creat twin to order we discuss the problem of medic consent and i ask him whether paradox as it might sound a child could have right even befor it concept i am increas think so it is quit clear in american law and increas in british law that the foetus has right these right matur at birth he explain and children had been abl to sue for damag in utero even for wrong birth if they emerg grossli abnorm do women have a right to bear their own children the right to have a babi is not absolut there are no absolut but i think the transmiss of generat is one of the most

sophist of debat especi in the hous of lord i think our democraci doe give us the basi for open and fair discuss we have to toler the newspap headlin and the pressur and that by the way is incred difficult and exhaust ing but if you enter a field like this it is part of what you must expect you can no longer work in isol in the laboratori you must accept the implic of your own decis and defend them it is veri wise to take advic from the ethic committe as soon as possibl have you been accus of bend your ethic to suit your profess as far as i know the opinion i gave in 1971 and after have not

their rank and a chang in qualiti there are not a few individu in whom repres of democrat forc have lost confid who serv at various level of the former govern and who have been forgotten by the peopl it is not desir that they return to polit activ in the rank of the democrat opposit they could be obstacl in the struggl for public opinion it is clear that this is a psycholog question and democrat organ must cross this psycholog barrier without fall into intern fragment mani articl in the opposit press have been devot to analysi of the democrat fall from govern last june while most of these were both object and subject basic the object reason were more discuss onli one must not forget the subject becaus the specul on the mechan by which the rank oppositionist were overthrown are narrow there is basi to think that the subject anatomi of the govern chang which took place follow the juli event have not been reveal in my opinion leader of the democrat opposit includ the renew leadership of the apf azerbaijan peopl front must pay attent to this question they were damag becaus of the shrink social basi of the democrat the most difficult and troublesom work will be to reviv this basi this includ the activ on the direct of build a correct idea among the popul about nation democrat valu which have been expos to a certain amount of deform propaganda should not be conduct in the framework of tradit govern opposit contradict but in the sector of explain the natur of the freedom and valu we have mention in other word not propaganda creat a sens of primit confront and imbu with a sens of psycholog superior the question of the transit to a market economi still convey a declar charact it appear that those in the govern do not have too much interest in this the stall of reform and the widespread briberi and corrupt has imped busi structur which had just begun to be form by businessmen and a natur flow of capit in the republ abroad is take place the democrat opposit must be turn into the spokesman of the repres of free econom strive those lead the way in this express will be found but if we wish to make the transit to a market economi if we wish to understand the advantag of this to the state creat the econom ground for social guarante for the poor and the import of econom freedom in societi we must not stint on everi kind of polit spiritu and intellectu aid for the develop of free busi and the reason imped this develop must be explain clear to the peopl if everi opposit organ were to prepar concret program of econom reform and turn these over for discuss among busi circl then it would be an excel proof of the serious of an oppos forc there is much talk about shortcom in the constitut if a constitut commiss were to be organ by the opposit to discuss altern despit the presenc of opposit repres on the state commiss and if they were to prepar an altern draft it would not be bad one could hold a campaign of constitut discuss by the opposit the democrat opposit must reach conclus and activ public clear direct of need reform connect with the question of build the countri becaus this question has been moribund state institut are not oper the democrat must clarifi for themselv how they want to view an independ state at the upper middl and lower echelon and conduct reform for the sake of the nation interest the last govern stall on this issu and was compel to work in structur inherit from the empir a more import question consist of the democrat opposit bring dynam into foreign polici concept in public opinion about foreign contact guarante that they will not ceas to back our independ are weak some step taken by the present govern in foreign polici and the polici follow dure the democrat govern are manifest of this in other word the present govern understand that onli pro russian contact increas the possibl of moscow break up our independ state and as a consequ would drive them from the govern the idea has been wide spread that process in russia influenc the real situat in azerbaijan set asid the correct of this idea the channel of such influenc have still not been clarifi effort by moscow to tie azerbaijan to itself through militarili side with armenia and to preserv it geopolit influenc in the caucasus region rais the obvious question as to whether this is the russian strategi and a visibl side of it polici the way to fight against this are also clear the invis side is no less danger it serv to shake our nation secur from within and serv the obstruct in build the state there is a need for more clarif here in higher and middl level state structur moscow seen and unseen cadr are in action the leadership by keep the former in their posit demonstr that it is follow a compet polici with regard to moscow as for moscow it use them to put pressur on the leadership and to implement concret sabotag scenario if they do not bow to this this is a mechan which preserv the republ under moscow control while at the same time prevent the develop of healthi polit relat within the republ we have to say that this mechan also function in the time of the preced govern in march april and may of last year the futur of this mechan came into question through the activ of western diplomaci from this standpoint the clarif of the subject anatomi of the june event is rather import one question that cannot be forgotten is that the west can increas it own activ in caucasian polit after the restor of democrat law in azerbaijan realiz of this would coincid with the neutral of imperi influenc in the region one can say that ideolog differ between organ of the democrat opposit are slight there is object room for cooper the question of interorganiz liaison must in general be turn into norm of polit behavior and from the spiritu standpoint this is also use for public opinion it is natur that no individu or organ can take respons for pull azerbaijan out of the crisi alon a coalit must be built among the opposit organ

mani these are excerpt from the oral argument befor the suprem court in the missouri abort case privaci right from charl fri repres the justic depart thank you mr chief justic and may it pleas the court today the unit state ask this court to reconsid and overrul it decis in roe vs wade at the outset i would like to make quit clear how limit that submiss is first we are not ask the court to unravel the fabric of unenumer and privaci right which this court has woven in case like meyer and pierc and moor and griswold rather we are ask the court to pull this one thread and the reason is well state by this court in harri and mcrae abort is differ it involv the purpos termin as the court said of potenti life and i would onli add that in the mind of mani legisl who pass abort regul it is not mere potenti life but actual human life and though we do not believ that the 14th amend take ani posit on that question we think it is an utter non sequitur to say that therefor the organ communiti must also take no posit in legisl and may not use such a posit as a premis for regul justic anthoni m kennedi your posit mr fri then is that griswold vs connecticut is correct and should be retain fri exact your honor kennedi is that becaus there is a fundament right involv in that case fri in griswold against connecticut there was a right which was well establish in a whole fabric of quit concret matter quit concret it involv not an abstract such as the right to control one bodi an abstract such as the right to be let alon it involv quit concret intrus into the detail of marit intimaci and that was emphas by the court and is a veri import aspect of the court decis kennedi doe the case stand for the proposit that there is a right to determin whether to procreat fri griswold sure doe not stand for that proposit kennedi what is the right involv in griswold fri beg your pardon kennedi what is the right involv in griswold fri the right involv in griswold as the court clear state was the right not to have the state intrud into in a veri violent way into the detail inquir into the detail of marit intimaci there was a great deal of talk about inquiri into the marit bedroom and i think that is a veri differ stori from what we have here procreat issu justic sandra day oconnor do you say there is no fundament right to decid whether to have a child or not fri i think that that question oconnor a right to procreat do you deni that the constitut protect that right fri i would hesit to formul the right in such abstract term and i think the court prior to roe vs wade quit prudent also avoid such sweep general that was the wisdom of griswold oconnor do you think that the state has the right to if in a futur centuri we had a serious overpopul problem has a right to requir women to have abort after so mani children fri i sure do not that would be quit a differ matter oconnor what do you rest that on fri becaus unlik abort which involv the purpos termin of futur life that would involv not prevent an oper but violent take hand on lay hand on a woman and submit her to an oper and a whole constel oconnor and you would rest that on substant due process protect fri absolut kennedi how do you defin the liberti interest of the woman in that connect fri the liberti interest against a seizur would be involv that is how the court analyz the matter in griswold that is how justic harland analyz the matter in his dissent in poe vs ullman which is in some sens the root of this area of law kennedi how do you defin the interest the liberti interest of a woman in an abort case fri well i would think that there are liberti interest involv in term perhap of the contracept interest but there is an interest at all point howev the interest of the woman is defin at all point it is an interest which is match by the state interest in potenti life kennedi i understand it is match but i want to know how you defin it fri i would defin it in term of the concret imposit on the woman which so offend the court in griswold and which are not present in the roe situat final i would like to make quit clear that in our view if roe were overrul this court would have to continu to polic the far outer boundari of abort regul under a due process ration basi test and that that test is muscular enough as chief justic rehnquist said in his dissent in roe to strike down ani regul which did not make adequ provis i think the import thing to realiz is that when roe was decid it swept off the tabl regul in the major of american jurisdict includ regul recent promulg by the american law institut and declar a principl which said that it was unfair and unreason to regul abort in way that most western countri still do regul abort we are not here today suggest that the court would therefor allow extrem and extravag and bloodthirsti regul and that it would lack the power to strike those down if they were present to it but it is a mistak to think that alon among govern institut viabil of fetus from frank susman a st loui lawyer repres those who success challeng the missouri abort law in lower court mr chief justic and may it pleas the court i think the solicitor general submiss is somewhat disingenu when he suggest to this court that he doe not seek to unravel the whole cloth of procreat right but mere to pull a thread it has alway been my person experi that when i pull a thread my sleev fall off there is no stop it is not a thread he is after it is the full rang of procreat right and choic that constitut the fundament right that has been recogn by this court for better or for wors there no longer exist ani bright line between the fundament right that was establish in griswold and the fundament right of abort that was establish in roe these two right becaus of advanc in medicin and scienc now overlap they coalesc and merg and they are not distinct justic antonin scalia excus me you find it hard to draw a line between those two but easi to draw a line between first second and third trimest susman i do not find it difficult scalia i dont see whi a court that can draw that line cant separ abort from birth control quit readili susman if i may suggest the reason in respons to your question justic scalia the most common form of what we generic in common parlanc call contracept today iud low dose birth control pill which are the safest type of birth control pill avail act as abortifaci they are correct label as both under this statut which defin fertil as the point of begin those form of contracept are also abortifaci scienc and medicin refer to them as both we are not still deal with the common barrier method of griswold we are no longer just talk about condom and diaphragm thing have chang the birth line if there ever was one has not been extinguish that whi i suggest to this court that we need to deal with one right the right to procreat we are no longer talk about two right kennedi do you agre that the state can forbid abort save to preserv the life of the mother after the fetus is say 8 month old susman if i understand the question justic kennedi i think the health right of the woman alway are suprem at ani stage of pregnanc kennedi suppos the health right of the mother are not involv the life or health of the mother are not involv can the state prohibit an abort after the fetus is 8 month old susman yes i am will to recogn the compel interest grant in roe of the state in potenti fetal life after the point of viabil kennedi but that is a line draw isnt it susman yes it is but that is a line that is more easili drawn i think there are mani cogent reason for pick the point of viabil which is what we have today under roe first of all histor both at common law and in earli statut this was alway the line chosen whether it was call quicken or viabil there is littl differ time wise oconnor well there is a differ is there not in those two susman technic between those two definit justic oconnor yes quicken had less of a medic signific it was when the woman could first detect movement procreat interest are inde implicit in the concept of order liberti and neither liberti nor justic would exist without them it is truli a liberti whose exercis is deepli root in this nation histori and tradit i think it is somewhat iron that the sole histor sourc cite by the solicitor general in his brief in an effort to disput this fact is a work by mr jame moor abort in america thirti percent of pregnanc in this countri today termin in abort it is a high rate it is a rate that sometim astound peopl but it is a rate that has not chang one whit from the time the constitut was enact through the 1800s and through the 1900s that has alway been the rate it is signific less than the worldwid rate worldwid 40 of all pregnanc termin in abort abort today is the most common surgic procedur in the unit state with the possibl except of contracept it remain today as it was in the day of roe 17 time safer than childbirth 100 time safer than appendectomi a safe procedur minor surgeri i suggest that there can be no order liberti for women without control over their educ their employ their health their childbear and their person aspir there doe in fact exist a deepli root tradit that the govern steer clear of decis affect the bedroom childbear and the doctor patient relationship as it pertain to these concern tradit of freedom chief justic william h rehnquist it is a deepli root tradit but sure abort was regul by the state in the 19th centuri and in the 20th centuri susman yes but i think it is necessari to go back and examin as the histor brief doe and other work as to the reason those regul were enact similar they were not done to protect the fetus those were not the purpos if you look for exampl rehnquist if you say there is a deepli root tradit of freedom in this area that suggest that there had been no legisl intervent to me what you are that simpli is not the fact scalia let me inquir i can see deriv a fundament right from either a long tradit that this the right to abort has alway been protect i dont see that tradit but i suppos you could also deriv a fundament right just simpli from the text of the constitut plus the logic of the matter or whatev how can you deriv it that way here without make a determin as to whether the fetus is a human life or not it is veri hard to say it just is a matter of basic principl that it must be a fundament right unless you make the determin that the organ that is destroy is not a human life can you as a matter of logic or principl make that determin otherwis susman i think the basic question whether this is a human life or whether human life begin at concept is not someth that is verifi as a fact it is a question verifi onli by relianc upon faith it is a question of label neither side in this issu and debat would ever disagre on the physiolog fact both side would agre as to when a heartbeat can first be detect both side would agre as to when brain wave can first be detect but when you come to tri to place the emot label on what you call that collect of physiolog fact that is where peopl part compani",

{"doc_text": "august 6 1989 sunday home edit a priest on abort woman as the proper moral agent few of us are neutral about abort most american want abort to be legal and safe they respect the freedom of a woman to choos whether or not she is to bear a child but most american are concern that we not creat an abort cultur that abort not becom just anoth method of birth control with 15 million abort each year 4 000 a day the issu becom a profound pastor one for me i know children who are now with us becaus in the honest and prayer struggl with the question of abort their mother some marri some singl decid to carri a child to matur and birth they all have express profound gratitud that abort was a legal and safe option i know women whose live were liter save from unravel emot and who were given a chanc for healthi matur live becaus legal safe abort was an avail choic which they accept as the fierc debat on this unyield dilemma break across the american landscap i want to share some of my convict and my doubt we are bound togeth by a communiti of faith there is space for struggl for conflict for explor for listen and for love those who disagre with us first the legal issu the suprem court landmark rule on roe vs wade in 1973 made abort on demand legal in the earli stage of pregnanc and gave state the right to protect the potenti life of the fetus in later state of pregnanc or as the court said when the fetus is viabl capabl of live outsid the womb the medic and scientif communiti have consist said a fetus is viabl no earlier than 24 week then on juli 3 1989 a divid suprem court open the way for state to limit a woman access to abort allow state to place more and more limit on abort this decis did howev stop short of overturn the roe vs wade rule that made the practic of abort legal in america associ justic harri a blackmun author of the 1973 rule call the juli 3 decis omin he wrote i fear for the futur i fear for the liberti and equal of million of women he said a woman fundament right to choos abort had surviv but it wasnt secur the juli 3 rule is an attempt to forc abort polici out of the court and into the polit arena into 50 state legislatur associ justic antonin scalia wrote that abort is a polit issu more than a legal one so from now on state legisl will grappl with ethic medic and legal complex that even the suprem court couldnt solv walter delling professor of law at duke univers said virtual all the power in legislatur is held by men who will never be affect by the restrict they impos yet their conclus will have a profound effect upon one of the most intim decis in a woman life there is a stori of three profession peopl argu about whose was the first profess on earth the argument involv a surgeon an architect and a politician the surgeon said i had to be first the bibl say that out of the side of adam god took a rib and creat eve that take a compet surgeon the architect said no you are wrong i had to be first becaus the bibl say that out of the chao god creat and fashion this marvel univers the politician said oh no i was first who do you think creat the chao politician in the missouri legislatur are say the life of a human be begin at concept they will requir a test at 20 week to determin whether the fetus is viabl even with the medic communiti agre that all evid say a fetus isnt viabl befor 24 week this is play to the anti abortionist posit that abort are be done veri late politician have been convinc that late term abort are commonplac enough to warrant restrict legisl some anti abort activist have clever creat the myth that women have abort right up to the time of deliveri for frivol reason the fact are clear and otherwis 90 of all abort are done befor the 13th week of pregnanc fewer than 1 of all abort occur after the 20th week and most of those are for urgent medic reason missouri is one of mani state that restrict fund for most abort leav poor women and mani young teenag to scrape togeth enough money to termin unwant pregnanc onli new york california and a few other state provid fund for abort now missouri say no public facil can be use it hit the poor the hardest the rate of abort among women whose famili annual incom is at or below the poverti line is more than doubl the rate for women of the middl class and abov some state also seek to ban abort from all clinic and requir a hospit set now more than 80 of abort are safe and inexpens perform in clinic this hospit requir would quadrupl the cost to about 800 one more effort to make abort less access especi to the poor the constitut guarante a woman the right to exercis some control over her uniqu abil to bear children the high court has now remov portion of that control on the step of the suprem court fay wattleton presid of plan parenthood ask rhetor about these constitut guarante when did it becom a polit question whether women had reproduct right the answer was easi juli 3 1989 and yet as the late associ justic robert h jackson said at mid centuri one right to life liberti and properti depend on the outcom of no elect whether pro choic or anti abort you do not have the right in this divers pluralist societi to forc belief and opinion on other there can never be a just law requir uniform of behavior on the abort issu from my perspect that is what the roman cathol church and the religi right attempt to do on abort the late cardin cush of boston onc said refer to the birth control controversi cathol do not need the support of civil law to be faith to their religi convict and they do not seek to impos by law their moral view on other member of societi may his spirit prevail mani of us have deep religi feel about abort about the moral qualiti of the individu decis involv but i believ it is critic to distinguish how i might judg the act of abort moral and what i believ a societywid polici on abort should be whatev my view the woman must be the moral agent in that decis the moral issu is the sanctiti of life the reason debat is so acrimoni is that both side share the ethic principl of respect for life but the sanctiti of life doesnt end debat for we must deal with two sanctiti fetus and mother let me state two extrem of the debat anti abort forc are declar more and more that human personhood begin at concept then abort a fetus is to them no more accept than ani other form of murder randal terri group oper rescu met last month for a ralli at the first nazaren church in pasadena rescu member are commit to close down abort clinic terri who has been arrest in citi after citi continu to push his caus with increas vigor he say were call on thousand of pro life american to peac blockad these kill center with their bodi to prevent children from die and we will launch an equal forc against state legislatur to chip away at the roe decis legal abort at the other extrem some pro choic forc feel a fetus is a mass of depend protoplasm to be extract without regret abort is mere the flush away of a mass of tissu both extrem fall short when doe human life begin when is there a live human person that is not a biolog fact to be discern it is a theolog percept to say the fetus is not aliv not a live realiti is absurd from the moment of concept it is a grow life but to say at the moment of concept there is a human person is equal absurd i believ there is life at concept life at a special time in it develop part of a continuum that begin in the uterus emerg as a human be at birth pass through childhood adolesc and adulthood and end in death the fertil egg is human in origin and destini it is grow and has the potenti of human personhood though it cannot be call a human person at that earli moment such a distinct is basic even to conserv theologian like dr john rw stott who comment that the decis to abort for reason of a mother health involv a choic between an actual human be and a potenti human be anti abort peopl want to eras all distinct between potenti life and actual life for mani women abort is one of the most import decis they ever make two ethic concern about life are present the sanctiti of the potenti human person and the sanctiti of a mother life her moral decis over her own bodi she struggl with the qualiti of life she could offer the babi at birth the impact of that birth on the exist web of her other respons plus her own mental health and well be i am not pro abort but i am passion pro choic i believ a woman is the proper moral agent to determin the use of her bodi she should have the choic of carri to matur her pregnanc as a theologian i see no way the moral status of a fetus can be of greater moral stand than a woman decid her destini it is a question of individu conscienc i refus to give over the moral issu of abort to a church or the religi right befor 1973 american women often chose to risk their own live rather than have an extra child that could destroy the famili abil to cope or would caus an unmanag crisi in famili life some ghast practic were use when surgic safe abort were not avail the radic natur of method onc resort to speak of the desper involv in unwant pregnanc there is someth vicious and violent about coerc a woman to carri to term an unwant child to forc the unwant on the unwil to use a woman bodi against her will and choic is a kind of legal rape that is moral repugn the grow restrict that state after state will place on abort in mani instanc recrimin it will not reduc the instanc of abort women will continu to put their live at risk to termin unwant pregnanc new restrict will onli put poor women in a more desper place and leav all women who have taken this risk more mental scar for life i cannot believ such action reflect a moral societi is there a way out as a priest and as an ethicist i want to be count as pro choic keep abort legal safe and avail to all but i seek a societi in which abort is less and less necessari so count me among those who favor public polici that will reduc the number of abort without coerc women the onli way that is possibl is to creat a differ kind of nation the societi we seek must have as it primari agenda the right of the born the improv qualiti of life for those who come into this marvel world adequ care and protect from the first stir to the final groan my grievanc is sever with so mani anti abort advoc who demand justic for the unborn but who also advoc dismantl social program that provid a decent life for children onc they enter the world if we are to reduc abort we must reaffirm by work and action the right of the born the societi we seek doesnt flaunt and exploit sex at everi turn vast number of adult today particip in the devalu of human sexual by separ sex from love and commit the societi we seek is one where greater scientif effort goe into develop safer and more reliabl birth control along with a commit to have this contracept inform and these contracept avail to all peopl today 50 of all teen ager are sexual activ i believ that realiti is a veri unhealthi phenomenon in our cultur onli 33 of teen ager use ani birth control method consist 25 of all abort are among the teen age popul condom prevent pregnanc and protect against the aid virus it immor not to act with urgenc in get contracept to teenag who are sexual activ the societi we seek say all life is sacr everywher for if it is cheap anywher it is cheap everywher onli as we see everi human be across this planet as a sacr person to be cherish onli then will we see a societi emerg in which abort is less and less a necessari option so with heart that feel and brain that think let us continu to walk as discipl of the christ and for me at this moment in time that mean to join my life in solidar with women who claim the moral respons over their own

disastr mount nonpay that threaten to bring about the collaps of our economi a new cours howev gaydar appar had not surmis yet that the new cours would also signifi the bankruptci of russian liber as the philosophi of the reform that were implement on his initi the moor has done his work liber has perform it fire brigad function deal a lethal blow to the command economi and open the floodgat to the element of the market and someth els should take it place they are fight against rather than for the pictur of a parti buildup which was undoubt stimul by the parliamentari elect or more precis their result appear to be get clearer it is as if everybodi sudden understood that it is difficult to win elect without parti without their local structur unlik what some promin democrat maintain refer to complet differ condit those of a stabl societi with a structur of long durat and of an american rather than european type parti have not at all becom a matter of the past the struggl against still prevail howev what is noteworthi here the fact that parti of a democrat hue whether newli built up or transform into some kind of new qualiti are still more dispos to fight against rather than for along with other caus this is the effect of the previous stage of the struggl when the strategi of the entir democrat movement was built on the basi of the against principl against the omnipot of the cpsu against real social against the red empir and so on i am tri to understand the new platform of the russian movement for democrat reform rddr as is known it suffer an unequivoc defeat in the elect fail to make it over the 5 percent threshold what conclus have it leader drawn gavriil popov say inde i understood as earli as after august 1991 and the choic of a new cours that voter would flee from the front of the govern that a backup line need to be built which would stop them from flee and draw them toward itself howev we put this backup line too close peopl ran past not onli us but also volskiy travkin and even the russian communist parti they ran all the way to zhirinovskiy what doe this mean if we deciph it it mean that the rddr should have taken up harsh opposit with regard to the rule reform at the same time yet anoth rddr leader anatoliy sobchak stress the movement should be base on a commonsens polici and becom a genuin liber parti if that is so what is liber about about critic the govern in a parlanc approxim that of zhirinovskiy in particular the liber of the rddr as interpret by popov began to merg not onli with a confront with the govern but also with anti western genuin or affect patriot and populist note began to be heard in it neither the pres parti of russian uniti and accord head by sergey shakhray nor the appl in which grigoriy yavlinskiy set the tone can be call liber in the strict sens of the word although they undoubt includ typic liber democrat howev they have the alreadi mention preponder of against motiv in common with the rddr for some it is against the presid and the govern for other it is against russia choic the most power democrat bloc which is current be transform into the russia choic parti head by yegor gaydar is perhap the most liber of all bloc and parti put it stake on owner market liber and in a sens even market romantic an ode to the bourgeoi in the favor mean of the word the preelect slogan of liberti properti and legal are typic liber howev recent the weight of argument against has also increas sharpli in this quarter this has happen due to the emerg of a new front in the struggl against the govern of viktor chernomyrdin present and past colleagu of yegor timurovich who do not share his view on the progress of reform what ideal do we defend liber democraci russian style is in a way a thing unto itself those who view our indigen liber in conjunct with say western analog will certain end up at an impass for exampl when we now refer to the liber intelligentsia the liber opposit and so on we frequent mean the phenomenon to which dostoyevskiy refer in his time and which is characterist onli of us the great writer and philosoph emphas this our entir liber parti the segment of the public with a liber disposit note by ak has pass the endeavor by without particip in it or touch it the parti mere negat and giggl we have mani liber democrat who are onli capabl of make mischief and ridicul anyth and everyth as they view the event in the countri follow august 1991 from the sidelin look down on them not particip in real polit and the affair of the countri in a posit way but mere negat and giggl poison everyth with pessim and hopeless and spread the catastroph sentiment we also have those who no sooner had they touch upon the real endeavor than they got burn and drop it curs everybodi and everyth they are liber maximalist sinc it has not gone their way may the fire of hell consum everyth a version concern the so call conspiraci which has stir up our societi also indic that russian liber is a special phenomenon it was clear from the veri begin that this was a provoc but who brought it into the world let us for now ignor the issu of the sponsor who launch it and who advertis it most extens our liber democrat from the mass media for some reason yegor yakovlev resolv to publish the version in obshchaya gazeta and for some reason yevgeniy kiselev consid it feasibl to first familiar ten of million of tv viewer with it through itogi on the independ televis channel and to subsequ endow the idea of a conspiraci with a certain credibl in a string of other conspiraci in yet anoth edit of itogi use to this end dmitriy furman and aleksandr minkin this is yet anoth exampl of how repres of the liber intelligentsia in a rather tradit manner benefit the forc of counterreform and the adversari of democraci by rous our societi and spread the catastroph sentiment we ourselv provok and fertil the soil for the appear of zhirinovskiy and we ourselv are later overcom by hysteria and panic natur blame the author for everyth we truli do not know what we are do put it plain the ralli abil of liber is poor for a long time i fail to understand whi the leader of our democraci did not get around to explain to peopl what kind of societi we want to build what our new ideal were and so on after all our fellow citizen may be suffer even more from uncertainti lack of confid in the futur and what to them appear to be hopeless than from econom hardship later i understood that rais the issu in this manner is in principl unaccept to them the liber it sicken them are ani addit explan need given that we live by the law of common sens that the market economi will sort everyth out and that the mechan of a rule of law state has been set in motion either an excess workload or some other caus is prevent the father of our liber democraci from recal that even the most liber societi for exampl the american need slogan and lofti ideal which mobil and ralli the citizen they do not shun patriot or spit upon the state sinc liber hard has a clear map out posit social ideal at all apart from general concern properti legal and so on and sinc it shun notion such as patriot and statehood and treat even the notion of social justic as cheap social popul it liber cannot becom a foundat for ralli democrat forc the camp of liber democrat is doom to disintegr under pressur from real life we observ this after august 1991 dure the period between 21 septemb and 3 4 octob and on the eve of the elect we are observ this now there is no theoret ethic or ani other foundat on which the democrat forc could ralli except for the fear of a return of totalitarian all appeal to those whom we associ with democrat parti bloc and so on not to feud or splinter and instead to ralli and unit they are all a wast of time a common platform should be develop first or at the veri least the scope of common interest for the struggl for rather than against should be determin everyth in it proper time it would be incorrect to say that russian liber is alien on our nation soil liber is root in russian histori in social thought and movement it is insepar from the superflu peopl and western inde the dissid movement which alway consid the western type of democraci and public life in general to be it model certain was a mighti sourc of liber idea undoubt the sudden flare up of love for the west the unit state in particular as a respons to the hatr artifici fuel by bolshevik play a role too this love made it presenc known as earli as the period of gorbachev perestroyka our naiv belief that the west will help us certain was a factor have renounc confront have remov the iron curtain have made major at time unilater concess to the west they said we deserv the right to have the west respond in kind to help us rise from the ruin of postcommun still the respons to our communist past was the main reason for the rise of liber in russia sinc communism was reject it antipod liber gain favor even more so given our nation inclin to rush from one extrem to the other howev the weak of russian liber also abid here first the hope for western aid were not justifi second a transit from communism to democrat form of exist turn out to be an except difficult endeavor besid this transit implement on the model of a liber market economi favor by the west entail mani unfavor consequ third the principl of liber with their emphasi on civil right and freedom the freedom of human person in all of it manifest began to depreci quit rapid at the stage of revolutionari transit from one social format to anoth against the background of the sudden impoverish of mani peopl the unpreced rampag of crime and correspond the aggrav of nostalgia for the past life in a unit state fourth mani of our former liber includ dissid have turn into propon of authoritarian in other word liber somewhat prematur proclaim itself to have in hand the situat in russia which appar is destin first to go through a differ histor stage nonetheless i believ that the tree of russian liber which be that as it may is deepli root in russian societi will undoubt grow and bear fruit this will happen although not too soon after all yeltsin is right rather than gaydar in general a revolutionari transit from one social system to anoth is accomplish as a rule under condit of rigid authoritarian or dictatorship likewis a new statehood is not at all built on the rubbl of an empir on the basi of liber this is all the more true becaus the entir previous system of social orient and spiritu valu has been blown away million of peopl have liter becom depress the spiritu void has reach threaten proport this is precis the time to creat new myth and new social utopia the time for ani strong remedi to appear with a view to overcom the state of depress of the nation and creat prerequisit for regular social well be if not for enthusiasm nation has turn out to be the strongest idea capabl of play an integr role at the initi stage of postcommunist develop in virtual all former republ of the former ussr to be sure nation is dubious and danger for russia in everi respect first nation would unavoid grow into great power chauvin in this countri which has multipl ethnic group given the underdevelop of the russian peopl ethnic awar second it would rather becom a disintegr factor for russia itself third russian nation if it were to pick up steam nonetheless in the spirit of our abil to be extrem would inevit make our relat with virtual the entir world hostil and would destroy the process of integr within the framework of the cis the idea of patriot statehood our spiritu heritag and our best tradit have alway been genuin integr for russia and are certain readi to be such at present it appear to me that bori yeltsin has grasp or felt deep down the need to make the idea of statehood foremost it was the mainstay of not onli his messag to the feder assembl but also quit of a number of present that follow it is precis with the idea of statehood and patriot among other thing that a path toward social accord must be sought i just do not see anoth idea a strong state is a guarante of overcom the crisi faster a prerequisit for mount a vigor struggl against crime howev it is also the most import condit for the exercis of civil right and liberti if a person is afraid for his life and the live of his famili if he is afraid to go out dure the even hour and has altogeth stop feel secur all talk of democraci freedom and so on turn into irrit demagogueri when yegor gaydar slight the idea of state regul all the more becaus the most power state sector exist and speak scorn about the advoc of state i want to repeat the jocular statement all of us know well yegor you are not right first the opinion of the peopl who in the cours of the elect voic dissatisfact with the result of reform cannot be ignor the real weight of radic democrat in our societi cannot be ignor either second as reform are be carri out we cannot forget about the peopl with all the talk about lobbi and credit infus into the agro industri complex the militari industri complex and the fuel and energi complex we somehow lose sight of the fact that ten of million of peopl work in these sector we must not fail to think about their fate hide behind general about the ineffect of the state sector and the kolkhoz sovkhoz system at time it seem to me that gaydar and some of his colleagu have just forgotten where they live and work in the countri that is call russia million of peopl have frequent agre to certain death howev in the name of what was it for cash on the barrel no it was in the name of an idea but by far not the one known as the american idea a nice hous with amen a lawn affluenc person independ digniti and so on the russian idea is a spiritu idea frequent if not alway it is steep in utopian and the set of unrealiz goal this is the root of mani of our troubl a chang of valu should take place which in turn should be a product of a more ration mass conscienc which is what happen with other european nation in their time this process is alreadi underway thank to among other the new russian howev an entir stretch of social develop will be need for it to be complet noth will work on the fli in a cavali fashion in this instanc or els new valu will be reject and histor progress reform will fail as happen in iran under the shah we are after all a nation of astound extrem just as furious as our grandfath fought the hate capit in the name of the unknown entic social their grandson are fight social in the name of capit have no real knowledg of either one of them the whole point is that appeal to go back to a stern realiti which is base on common sens cannot be as inspir

the ussr subsequ transfer to the govern of sovereign moldova and when the question concern their repay becam a press one businessman birshteyn propos an origin move as a result of which dollar from the repay of the foreign currenc credit debt in the amount of over three million dollar went into the budget of the republ in that manner seabeco is provid the govern with interest free credit our moldovan leu was print in pari and modern communic defens and special equip for the ministri of intern affair were paid for specif by money from the firm the orgeyev canneri is undergo reconstruct and a zone of farm with a complet servic complex is be creat in faleshtskiy rayon on the basi of seabeco design and at it expens the firm provid assist through sponsorship of project in the sphere of public health and cultur as well as aid for those with low incom and for victim of combat oper last year some 50 000 leus over 2 000 dollar and more than 4 000 frg mark were alloc for that purpos koretskiy mister birshteyn without reveal ani trade secret pertain to your futur project let us talk about where your invest will be go birshteyn i am proceed from the fact that moldova is basic an agrarian republ and natur i intend invest capit in agricultur and in particular in the process industri then take into account the geograph posit of moldova it climat and the exist of a diaspora both in the far and the near abroad i believ that it is necessari to develop a tourism industri koretskiy allow me to disagre with your viewpoint concern the agricultur profil of moldova and remind you of the first class potenti of the republ in the machin build and electron industri unfortun these capac are now idl and the industri is in a declin on the basi of your experi could you suggest a way out of this dead end situat birshteyn i am not an electron expert but i am quit familiar with the experi of far eastern countri which creat such a power market in that branch therefor today it is extrem difficult to meet the demand of modern electron that is to win the market but not hopeless how through the product of uniqu unit and bloc call for the effort of high skill personnel in the east as well as in the west everyth is base on high precis automat equip flow line moldova howev would be abl to interest produc with it high skill worker whose labor is relat cheap here it is necessari to look for partner i brought up that question with muravskiy govern koretskiy did you bring it up as a member of the higher econom council of the presid of the republ of moldova birshteyn yes unfortun howev noth happen koretskiy tell me mr birshteyn as chairman of the higher econom council do you see a way out of the crisi in which moldova has found itself birshteyn i would like you to take into account that this crisi has engulf all countri of the so call socialist camp and it is quit natur therefor there is no need to dramat the situat i person believ that moldova will get on it feet befor other cis countri provid there is a stabl polit situat becaus of it geopolit posit econom base and the industri of the peopl these are the power intern reserv which have not been mobil until now but help and invest are need in ani undertak that is the first factor which must come into play sever day ago i help to organ a meet of a larg group of western businessmen with the presid of moldova the discuss concern invest big invest project which open up extens prospect a frank busi dialogu took place in the cours of which the head of the republ express doubt in the current cours toward acquisit of credit to the detriment of invest if the polici of the govern in that area should chang consid it to be my small contribut as chairman of the presidenti council after all the investor bring not onli money into this countri but also what is most import his expertis and knowledg the abil to organ the undertak so that it profit the investor and the countri and this mean the peopl as well in addit to that it allow entri into western sale market which in turn mean the revers flow of foreign currenc is that not advantag for the countri veri mani pilot project were propos at that meet which will undoubt be follow by other it is a good sign when major western firm manifest interest in invest in moldova koretskiy mr birshteyn again base on your experi of cooper with moldova what obstacl do you visual in the way of these vivifi invest birshteyn i believ that the answer is clear to anyon with even a minim involv in busi condit for the develop of busi are need a legisl base is requir which clear differenti the right and duti of the businessman the domest and foreign businessman in order to avoid groundless accus of nation pilfer how can i be pilfer the nation when i am invest my capit in it and build after all birshteyn for instanc cannot take this hotel or plant or a process line with him to canada it was and will remain the properti of this countri my task is that of ani investor which is to ensur that the properti is viabl earn profit and provid employ for peopl we also touch on anoth one of these obstacl the tax polici when tax exceed a reason limit they discourag ani interest among investor to inject their capit into this countri it is possibl to understand the young state which is attempt to satisfi it need through the tax system but not at ani price at ani price is not alway the correct polici life is alreadi suggest to the politician where they made an incorrect step in that sphere and everyth one must think will return to a normal civil path after all they were abl to establish some benefit for agricultur and the process industri that mean not everyth is lost koretskiy let us return to the search of way to resolv the econom crisi for some of our politician the creation of free econom zone appear as a panacea against all econom ill what do you think about that idea birshteyn i will not hide the fact that it appeal to me and i was one of those who voic this repeat except that it was not about the econom zone but about the offshor busi zone similar to liechtenstein and monaco it mean that for local and foreign capit special preferenti condit are creat for develop these condit which are cover in intern law allow the state to develop necessari branch to it advantag and receiv profit for the servic of invest while build and grow richer without invest it own fund koretskiy bori iosifovich you state that you are make your main invest in agricultur of moldova great transform are now take place in the countrysid the reform is destroy kolkhoz and allow joint stock compani to develop along with peasant farm and farmer in your busi deal who do you prefer work with kolkhoz or individu farm birshteyn this question i see is a load one i will answer frank i prefer to work with the state alway all those project which i mention will be carri out togeth with the govern on an equal foot the govern will get it share and our firm will get it share all this will take place on a contractu basi and the result can be check through document at ani time koretskiy excus me but here is anoth load question you work on the basi of the same principl ie direct both in russia and kyrgyzstan which is what gave rise to accus against the seabeco firm birshteyn these accus howev burst like a soap bubbl onc document and fact were present also i find it difficult to understand how it is possibl to level groundless accus from a high tribun without troubl to acquir inform from the ministri of foreign econom relat after all everi figur is reflect in it sinc these document made their appear my stern critic fell silent for those reason i releas an offici statement that i am termin my activ in russia and kyrgyzia koretskiy here in moldova critic was also level against seabeco regard accuraci of inform birshteyn you know i pay no attent to that ballyhoo either here or over there there is no time the accus themselv are so confus and stereotyp that one begin to wonder is it not absurd to say that birshteyn use his privat aircraft ha ha brought over nuclear wast in order to buri it in krikov mine or somewher in siberia someon want to put the blame for all the troubl on seabeco or on ani foreign in order to appear patriot time usual provid the best evalu of such phenomena even the great sinner rutskoy is now free and crimin proceed were initi against his righteous accus editor nezavisimaya moldova has a packet of document and offici paper compil by various monitor organ of the republ at differ time they provid a most thorough analysi of all activ of the seabeco moldova firm cite figur and balanc and reflect the legisl base under oper of the firm as well as audit of the mutual settlement of account with the co founder the onli violat that the auditor were abl to reveal was a delay in deduct of fund into the social fund of the republ for which a fine was levi in the amount of 17 392 moldovan rubl koretskiy by the way about rutskoy your well known flight from moscow to chisinau on your person aircraft was view in the republ in a high vari manner could you shed more light on this unusu visit now sometim after the fact birshteyn as common known there was a war go on at that time and it is the most loathsom thing i have ever known in my life my soul rebel against blood be spill on the land i love against the suffer and grief of the refuge and the overal depress in societi i was inform that the figur of rutskoy was the spark that ignit that war his presenc in tiraspol was view as approv of their cours as a cart blanch know him person i consid it my moral duti to ask rutskoy to come here and help resolv the conflict to my great delight i succeed koretskiy mr birshteyn your faith in male friendship is impress you have never renounc your friend who work in the cpsu central committe after this seem invinc parti disintegr you did not disavow rutskoy either when he was put in jail or ani of the other who found themselv in disfavor what is that a pose self confid a charact trait birshteyn in moldova inasmuch as i know that is call cei sapt ani de acasa seven year of home upbring i was rais in a cultur famili where the concept of friendship keep one word and decenc were place abov all my attitud toward a person whether he is a minist the presid or a driver never come from the desir for person gain mani of my friend as they say had their up and down but that did not alter my attitud toward them becaus am an absolut independ person and treat my attach as i deem necessari without care for the opinion of other or proceed from the polit situat i valu true friendship and know how to prize it koretskiy without beat around the bush tell me how compat are the concept of moral and busi birshteyn i know that educ use the classic of marxism lenin as an exampl has imbu peopl with a certain stereotyp way think in this regard i would like to note that in the busi world real busi decenc and keep one word are valu abov all els that kind of reput is high valu in my busi deal i have alway tri to take the honest path engag in good busi and attain a certain level so that my firm logo would be associ in peopl mind with good qualiti work a few day ago i met a gentleman who thank me for the high qualiti of my sport outfit but good heaven i was in sport outfit some ten year ago this mean that the buyer rememb and appreci it this is veri import and dear to me to earn money just for the sake of money is a bore undertak i have alway want for my capit to bring good to peopl that is whi i have built and will continu to build i am initi new project that will remain after i am gone that after all is also moral the fact that such a style of work doe not appeal to some and they attempt to blacken everyth is also a peculiar form of moral fortun time put everyth in it place passion will calm and they will be forgotten while this hotel and much els will remain and serv the peopl and moldova editor bori birshteyn doe not like be over cautious he is not prone to sentiment and reflect which are so peculiar to the intelligentsia or apprehens which is characterist of entrepreneur of soviet origin his trust natur is combin with a narrowli utilitarian outlook and pragmat mr birshteyn cannot stop and glanc back to show off befor a mirror to brag let us say about his wealth and rest on his laurel he sincer believ himself to be a gentleman who has never harm anyon birshteyn has so littl time for think about himself that he hesit answer question about what color his eye are or how mani languag he speak bori birshteyn speak russian german english yiddish and ivrit and use them all in his work koretskiy a new strata of busi peopl is now form in moldova what error would you warn them against birshteyn against grab and rest that is unpromis it is import to think and act in a broader fashion here i see one of my own omiss which i am hope to rectifi the thing is that moldova has no good school for busi train i manag to establish someth like that in kyrgyzia it is staf by high qualifi foreign professor who teach the abc of modern busi life graduat receiv not onli an intern class diploma but also good knowledg which help them start their own busi i hope that such a busi school will appear in moldova as well editor we howev are hope that not just a busi school as such will make it appear in moldova but a school of moldovan busi in the broadest sens of the word ie our own class of busi peopl who will build busi on the basi of principl propound by b i

suggest aliv henri say so far our test say no henri and other have found that warm season grass are in the same water use ballpark as citrus and decidu fruit tree and most ground cover it not true that lawn are use all the water in the garden and that ground cover use 80 less theyr actual quit close the implic is that you can save a lot of water if you tear out your lawn but to tear out a bermuda grass lawn and replant it with gazania is a wast of time and will not save water henri say im not an advoc of wall to wall turf grass but peopl should make a decis base on fact befor they develop a garden that is lawn coyot brush or pansi but it is not bermuda grass lawn or the tough new univers develop zoysia grass that peopl are plant the current favorit is tall fescu a cool season grass that use quit a bit of water but look veri good sold under a varieti of brand name such as marathon tall fescu were unheard of 10 year ago but today account for 80 of all sod sale homeown have taken to tall fescu not onli becaus they look more like eastern lawn grass and do not go dormant in winter but also becaus theyv heard that tall fescu are deep root and drought resist which they are up to a point they have a better rang of drought toler and can surviv the miss water say mike henri but they cant surviv on 10 inch of water a year like the warm season grass in most case these new tall fescu lawn look better simpli becaus they are new and owner care of their invest are water them more often it quit easi to keep a new lawn look good for three five even 10 year but then the soil becom compact thatch dead grass and runner begin to build up water begin to run off and fertil drop at that point no amount of water is go to make it look good a lawn of redon bermuda grass or of newli plant warm season grass would look as good as a new tall fescu lawn but would requir less water one thing all expert agre on is that midsumm is not the time to make radic changeov if you are think of uproot your lawn or a portion of it wait until the cooler weather in the fall when new plant need less frequent water to becom establish otherwis you use more water begin a new garden than you would maintain an establish one even without threat from citi govern some garden have alreadi said their farewel to front lawn the least use of lawn i got sick and tire of push a lawn mower for almost 80 year say robert a mitchel of los angel who tore out an age bermuda grass lawn and replac it with various succul and ground cover includ gazania and red appl ice plant and shrub all that mow edg fertil and weed got to me but i final did it becaus i think it import to save water i think lawn are pass now his new ground cover are irrig with the old lawn sprinkler onli onc everi two week the lawn was water two or three time a week a few block away michael dula and alison sowden deep six their lawn becaus no matter how much we water our lawn it was never enough it never look good dula say rather than redo the lawn and it rusti sprinkler system they plant an attract collect of drought resist ground cover perenni and shrub it start out as an ecolog thing but turn into a hobbi say dula who with his wife is now tackl the back yard now they water everi three to four week and are convinc that the new plant are definit a lot less work and more fun a lot of garden can sympath with the dula veri few southern california lawn look all that good cooper extens research found that there is about three time as much lawn in the southern california as there should be consid the amount of

dozen of garden everi year still he has found precious few custom for his water conscious idea someon final ask me to do a garden with no lawn they want unusu drought resist plant instead it was real

in or around new subdivis and commerci develop in the rapid grow new communiti from lancast to temecula bright green sod is as promin as banner and flag on open day peopl want a landscap now and sod is an instant solut explain smith and it doe have a lot go for it you can walk on it almost immedi it stop eros hold down dust prevent weed and it is easi and inexpens to instal and maintain unfortun most of the new sod around develop is the tall fescu not the warm season grass sprinkler run endless and water pour down the street but even among develop there are sign of chang bob reed convinc his partner to tri a lawnless garden in front of one new hous in their riversid counti tract it wasnt easi all they could think of was cactus and gravel say reed landscap design john deforest did use cactus and gravel but also all kind of other plant that make the front a fascin tapestri it sure look better than a lawn to my eye say reed it isnt just new condo complex and trendi tract that commit

grass becaus ani other plant would get in the way of an open car door randal ismay primari consult for landscap and water manag consult in los angel and laguna niguel and a strong propon of xeriscap concur with iwata on silli lawn what the heck is a lawn do in the middl of the street nobodi can even walk on it that misus it xeriscap a term coin by the denver water depart in 1980 mean water conserv through creativ landscap say iwata water save garden requir more care thought and plan and initi are more expens to instal but they pay off down the road iwata see xeriscap as a sensibl and necessari next step for california garden mani think xeriscap mean you have to get rid of lawn say ismay wrong xeriscap doe not mean no more turf it mean we stop abus and misus it grass is not appropri in the middl of the street but it certain is appropri in park and in play area you cant ask your kid to go play on the coyot brush that tough drought resist shrubbi ground cover would provid an uncomfort play area inde iwata in fact is wait for autumn cooler weather to plant a small lawn in her own garden so that her 3 year old has a place to play like most of the garden she design her own garden is most landscap with nativ and other drought resist plant a lot of peopl think that xeriscap mean zeroscap she say but that not the idea at all in my garden i have all the plant peopl think they are go to have to give up from azalea to violet and in a few month a lawn but as a whole the garden use veri littl water the ideal xeriscap ismay say and what we strive for would use three time as mani plant while also use less water the idea is to plant more greeneri not less most of those advoc xeriscap do see lawn as part of the landscap pictur if plant wise and less frequent a key step in solv the lawn and water problem is to fine tune water and irrig system peopl who water concret and allow runoff to rush down the gutter give lawn a bad name concreto no crese concret doesnt grow in spanish accuraci is the new word in irrig say iwata it extrem import to put the right amount in the right place she say and help is on the way there are new sprinkler that spray water in a flatter arc so less is scatter to the wind and that appli it at a lower rate so it can sink in and not run off new automat timer work in on off cycl that also give the ground time to absorb the water

think that the biggest lesson we have learn is that our leader at various level lack a clear understand and experi in whether or not it remain necessari to exercis macroeconom regul and control under the new situat of relax price control the develop of a socialist market economi doe not mean the complet decontrol of commod price both our own and foreign experi prove that larg commod price increas are detriment to reform and develop this confer is held to unifi our think and understand sum up experi and lesson and take a further step to make the veget basket work and the grain cotton and edibl oil work meet the requir of socialist market econom structur 1 govern at all level should be veri much concern about and pay attent to improv the peopl live standard in the econom work dure the cours of advanc to a modern power socialist countri we should alway pay attent to two major task the task of feed the peopl and the task of construct and correct handl the relationship between the two feed the peopl mean solv the peopl livelihood problem which is a major task that govern at all level must perform well we must unifi our think and understand with this task in mind strive to do good veget basket grain cotton and edibl oil work and maintain a suffici market suppli and relat stabl price our govern is the peopl govern and the purpos of the peopl govern is to wholeheart serv the peopl to be concern about the peopl vital interest at all time is bound duti of our govern at all level grain cotton edibl oil and nonstapl food are the basic necess of the peopl livelihood we use to say fuel wood rice edibl oil salt soy sauc vinegar and tea were our seven daili necess today we should add veget as anoth necess and as the top necess at present the incom of most of our peopl in both urban and rural area is still quit low and their food expens still account for a larg proport of their total consumpt expens under such a situat the price of grain edibl oil meat veget egg aquat product and other major food item have a direct bear on the peopl consumpt level if food price are too high urban and rural resid will have to increas their basic live expens and reduc other spend and their actual live standard will be affect our parti and govern are the repres of the peopl interest we should take constant improv of the peopl live standard as the object of all our work sinc we are elect by the peopl we should protect their interest a veri import one of the three caus in the conduc to three caus stress by comrad deng xiaop is improv the peopl live standard the other two are develop the product forc of our socialist societi and strengthen the overal capac of our socialist countri the govern at all level should first strive to meet the basic need of all the peopl and then keep improv their live standard onli after we solv well the problem concern the peopl livelihood which they are most concern about will they support us and listen to what the parti and govern say the solut of the problem concern the product and suppli of veget grain cotton and edibl oil is inde a veri import matter and we must not treat it light to correct handl the relationship among reform develop and stabil is the principl which we must pursu to do good veget basket grain cotton and edibl oil work to maintain social stabil is the precondit for deepen reform and promot develop while to do good veget basket grain cotton and edibl oil work is of great signific to maintain social stabil this is a year in which we will take a major step in reform of econom structur a smooth proceed of the reform requir us to maintain social stabil and reassur the peopl a sharp commod price increas will make peopl worri caus social instabl obstruct the smooth proceed of reform and affect the overal situat of econom develop while the broad mass of the peopl are the main forc for reform no reform can succeed without the peopl support of all commod what the peopl could feel most direct is the fluctuat of major food price such as those of grain edibl oil meat veget egg milk and aquat product we must make great effort to maintain a relat stabil in the price of grain edibl oil and major nonstapl food so as to consolid and enhanc the current social situat of stabil and uniti in deepen reform we must simultan consid the interest of all strata in urban and rural area reform conform to the fundament interest of the broad mass of the peopl and they have inde enjoy huge practic benefit of reform in the last decad and more howev a fact dure the cours of reform is that not everi strata and everyon enjoy the same interest and benefit at the same time for this reason we in our work should show special concern for those who have not yet becom well off or even are still lead a quit difficult life to further arous the peasant enthusiasm for product it is necessari to proper rais the purchas price of grain and cotton and the higher price will benefit the peasant howev higher price of agricultur and sidelin product will yield a certain impact on some low incom urban resid particular the worker and staff member of those enterpris that have complet or partial suspend product student of colleg and secondari vocat school retir personnel and peopl in poor region and disast stricken region govern at all level should take effect measur and make effort to help the low incom peopl overcom difficulti in livelihood and ensur that their basic need in life are met 2 ensur an ampl suppli of commod and build a big circul setup develop product and enliven circul are basic condit

effort and forg stabl relat between product and market in order to ensur balanc market suppli make up shortfal in off season and optim the product mix we must not make the mistak of neglect it all year round and start panic buy everywher when a shortfal in suppli emerg trigger price hike in the market local must set asid special fund for construct of nonstapl food grain cotton and edibl oil product base increas input and speed up the pace of construct modern technolog includ plastic sheet the use of straw compost to fertil farmland sprinkl and trickl irrig mechan hog and chicken farm fish farm manufactur of compound feed the use of solar energi and introduct of fine strain from other region or oversea should be util in build the product base we should increas output improv qualiti reduc cost and improv effici by way of technic progress while work vigor to develop product we must establish a big commod circul setup and an oper mechan promot overal balanc free flow of good and flexibl oper nationwid the problem face us today is not shortag but a lack of transport capac to ship the good to the market region in a time fashion creat overstock in produc region and shortag in market area govern in all local must attach import to the construct of transport storag preserv and other basic circul facil to facilit the shipment of veget from the south to the north and grain from the north to the south and from the central region to the west we must truli ensur the free flow of commod and close link product region with market region the ministri of agricultur and intern trade and other relev depart must continu their support for engin project relat to the veget basket with fund technolog and materi govern in all local must take further step to remov all kind of obstacl to circul and stern crack down on gangster and thug in the transport sector except for a small number of essenti checkpoint approv by the provinci govern all other checkpoint must be dismantl railway and other transport depart must give prioriti to the shipment of farm product larg and medium size citi must creat condit to attract out of town veget grower to market their produc in the citi by ensur their safeti and fair trade 3 develop agricultur and sidelin product market and improv market administr to do a good job in the product and suppli of nonstapl food grain and edibl oil it is necessari to pay attent to market construct and the establish of a network which combin agricultur product market center on wholesal market with retail this import experi was gain by some of the larg and medium size citi which have achiev result in build veget basket project in recent year today china has a consider number of wholesal market that are play a posit role howev the develop of agricultur product market still fall short of the need of econom develop and the peopl livelihood a lot remain to be done govern at all level should upgrad expand or perfect the exist wholesal market in a plan way and build a number of region wholesal market of agricultur product the state plan to build sever central level wholesal market for agricultur product in key produc region and major citi in the next few year we will tri to build a network of wholesal market compos of central region and local wholesal market and develop a unifi nationwid market to bring about nationwid circul of commod under the condit of decontrol oper govern at all level must pay particular attent to market manag lift control to enliven oper doe not mean wash our hand of the oper in term of the characterist of product and market agricultur product sidelin product in particular involv consider risk on the other hand they are essenti sensit commod in the market that have a direct impact on the peopl livelihood as such they are unlik to remain stabl if left to the spontan regul of the market alon for this reason the more restrict are lift to enliven the market the greater effort we should make to improv market administr lack of a standard system for market transact lack of market order and assort deceit practic that are found in the marketplac these are conspicu problem face the agricultur product market in mani local and in larg and medium size citi these harm factor have sever affect normal trade in the market we must adopt effect measur to solv them we must stern crack down on illeg element who manipul the market specul or jack up price produc or sell substandard or fake merchandis entrap peopl or swindl them or commit other illeg act we should cut down the intermedi link in the chain of circul to the benefit of the produc and consum industri commerci public secur railway and transport depart must close coordin with each other to take concert action and ensur a notabl improv in market order and maintain a good market order indefinit 4 put in place effect mean for exercis macroeconom regul and control the degre of matur of the market economi is close link to macroeconom regul and control a matur market econom system must have effici way to exercis macroeconom regul and control to meet the need of econom develop it is entir correct to lift price control under no circumst howev should we let up macroeconom regul and control in exercis macroeconom regul and control we use chiefli econom and legal mean but that doe not rule out administr mean when necessari at present the follow three task should be grasp in the regul and control of farm product in our countri first it is necessari to establish a reserv system of grain cotton oil meat and sugar agricultur output is affect by whether and suppli often goe up and down it is therefor necessari to store up appropri reserv to regul suppli and balanc market suppli and demand the recent fluctuat in grain price taught us this import lesson with grain in our hand our heart will not panic it tell us how import it is to have grain reserv grain is a daili necess and grain price have a broad impact a sharp rise in grain price will lead to price rise in other commod when we have ampl grain reserv we will be abl to stabil price this time grain price across the countri were brought down after the state grain reserv administr sold onli a limit amount of grain the central and local author should establish a reserv system of grain cotton oil meat and sugar with determin more effort should be made to improv the administr and use of reserv it is necessari to make a distinct between polici reserv and oper and work reserv second it is necessari to establish a risk fund system for grain and sidelin product a decis in this regard was made at the central confer on rural work and the nation work confer on the veget basket last year accord to the decis all the save of central and local author from the abolit of subsidi for grain meat and veget should be channel to the grain and nonstapl food risk fund moreov more capit should be rais from other sourc to expand the system to an appropri scale the risk fund should serv as a mechan and be use in a rollov cycl way so that it can grow continu the risk fund should be use main to stabil price and protect the produc interest third it is necessari to establish a system of supervis and control agricultur and sidelin product market and to improv inform network for agricultur and sidelin product good inform can help promot product and set peopl mind at rest correct inform can be use by the govern as a scientif basi for enforc effect macrocontrol sinc novemb last year the sale price of grain and edibl oil rose by a great extent in some local and peopl rush to purchas food product one of the lesson we learn was that concern depart did not forese the problem and did not take prompt action commerci and grain depart should consid the work of watch the market and stabil price as their constant task they should play the state commerci outlet role as the main channel of suppli at critic moment in the cours of implement the new tax system the financi and taxat depart should studi way to formul measur to assist state own and collect enterpris engag in the oper of grain edibl oil and other supplementari food product and activ support them in fulfil the task of stabil commod price and ensur ampl suppli of foodstuff in the market 5 further implement the mayor respons system judg from the characterist of commod we can see that meat poultri egg and veget are differ from grain and edibl oil grain and edibl oil can be store for a long time transport to and from distant place and can even be import to adjust the market situat supplementari food product are most fresh and perish item and cannot be store for a long time peopl want to use them daili the characterist of supplementari food product tell us that the solut to the problem of supplementari food product must main fall on local govern i have repeat stress the veget basket problem should be tackl by govern at various local especi larg and medium citi and the system of link mayor job respons to target should be implement make proper arrang for peopl daili life is a mayor primari duti and the most import thing in stabil the whole situat when a citi cannot provid resid with ampl veget basket commod at relat stabl price we will not question the provinci governor or vice mayor but will investig the mayor this is becaus a mayor is the highest administr offici in a citi and has the mean and power to adjust the use of manpow materi and fund to guarante the product and suppli of supplementari food product this point should be includ in the system of link mayor job respons to target we should evalu the mayor work each year and report the evalu result to citi peopl congress and the peopl how can a mayor do a good job in the veget basket project the most import thing is to ensur an overal balanc of demand and suppli of supplementari food product various larg and medium citi should take up respons to ensur an overal balanc of demand and suppli it is necessari to ensur a balanc of demand and suppli in normal time and it is even more necessari to ensur a balanc of demand and suppli of supplementari food product in off season we should see to it that peasant are enthusiast about produc veget becaus they obtain relat high benefit the problem is that we should through the market mechan link veget farmer with consum and ensur free circul of supplementari food product when we talk about seek an overal balanc of suppli and demand we do not mean larg and medium citi should all be self support various citi should develop product to strenthen their self sustain abil and can make up for inadequaci by obtain supplementari food product from other place through market mechan mayor of larg and medium citi should effect shoulder this respons take the initi to do a good job and discov and solv problem in a prompt manner we must never wait and solv problem after they happen becaus in this way our loss will be too larg it is necessari to guarante the area of requir veget garden and strict forbid wanton occup of them at present some citi occupi too mani veget garden for other purpos and do not build new one as replac this is the main reason for the short suppli of veget in some local we must solv this problem as quick as possibl in citi plan and establish econom develop zone we should tri our best to avoid the use of exist veget garden if we must util exist one we should till and cultiv new garden and then use them in build base for produc supplementari food product various larg and medium citi should accord to need establish stabl cooper with other place in produc and market supplementari food product in solv the problem of veget product it is necessari to gradual form a pattern of lay stress on produc veget on the outskirt of citi use suburban area as supplementari veget product base and adjust suppli with other local we must be determin to establish a fund for build veget product base a fund for price risk and a fund for build refriger storeroom and other facil when we can ensur the avail of these three kind of fund we shall be abl to guarante an ampl suppli of veget and relat stabl price in the market the rais of those fund should main depend on various local so long as we strict control the scale of capit construct open less develop zone and build less real estat project we will not have much difficulti in rais these three kind of fund not long ago comrad jiang zemin emphat point out parti committe and govern at all level should attach great import to the veget basket project and work relat to grain cotton and edibl oil i am convinc that so long as the whole parti and govern at all level attach great import to the work and mayor pay person close attent to the work we can certain improv it further",

impli that a panel must have receiv evid with respect to safeti and effect of a devic befor it can make a classif recommend under this premis the burden of provid evid substanti the safeti and effect of a devic rest on the manufactur and the absenc of suffici data may be refer to in a panel recommend as the reason for classif of a devic into class iii see h rept no 94 853 94th cong 2d sess 40 1976 p 40 5 one comment assert that the refer cite by fda in the propos rule classifi the total tmj implant did not exist at the time of the panel meet and therefor could not have been evalu by the panel when make it recommend fda disagre with this comment it is true that some of the inform cite by fda in support of it propos classif of the total tmj implant did not exist at the time of the panel april 21 1989 meet howev the propos rule reflect not onli the panel recommend but also fdas determin regard the proper classif of these devic the propos rule did not state or impli that the panel reli on all the data cite by the agenc in support of the propos rule 6 sever comment suggest that when classifi these devic fda should distinguish tmj prosthes contain proplast tm from those not contain that materi these comment recommend that onli devic contain proplast tm should be classifi some comment state that the risk to health identifi in the propos rule are base onli on data associ with the failur of tmj prosthes contain proplast tm one comment state that proplast tm implant and non proplast tm implant specif cobalt chrome and polymethylmethacryl pmma prosthes should be classifi separ becaus the differ in the materi use in these implant signific affect their safeti and effect sever comment state that surgeon and tmj implant manufactur had observ no specif case of the risk to health identifi in the propos rule in sever patient implant with a non proplast tm total tmj prosthesi some comment state that these risk to health were not observ in patient implant with tmj prosthes manufactur by specif manufactur in contrast sever comment said that these risk were observ often in patient implant with tmj implant contain proplast tm accord to 860 5 c 3 when fda initi classifi a devic it may consid safeti and effect data develop for other devic of the same generic type a generic type of devic includ devic that do not differ signific in purpos design materi energi sourc function or ani other featur relat to safeti and effect and for which similar regulatori control are suffici to provid reason assur of safeti and effect see 860 3 i the transcript of the april 21 1989 panel meet demonstr that the panel consid tmj implant compos of various materi ie silicon proplast tm dural graft fascia vitallium acryl meniscl and silast befor make it recommend with respect to classif evid submit dure the panel meet reveal that similar risk and similar safeti and effect concern are associ with all tmj implant regardless of materi composit base on the evid provid the panel conclud that tmj devic compos of differ materi rais the same safeti and effect question thus the panel conclud and fda agre that tmj implant of all materi should be regul within the four generic type of devic identifi becaus the devic do not differ signific in the safeti and effect question rais and consequ similar regulatori control will be need to provid reason assur of their safeti and effect 7 comment state that one of the health risk identifi in the propos rule loosen of the total tmj prosthesi is direct relat to the health of the bone at the implant interfac these comment assert that loosen of the devic doe not occur unless there is a void of suitabl bone as state in the preambl to the propos rule fda has determin that the screw use to anchor the implant may loosen result in

fda to chang it opinion 8 some comment assert that fda should classifi all the tmj implant into class ii becaus special control would allow the agenc to impos special condit on these devic such as postmarket surveil one of these comment receiv from a tmj implant manufactur recommend that fda classifi tmj cobalt chrome pmma implant into class ii fda disagre with these comment fda believ that insuffici inform exist to establish that special control would provid reason assur of the safeti and effect of these devic fda believ that a pma is necessari to provid such assur furthermor postmarket surveil is not limit to class ii devic thus at some futur time fda may request that manufactur of tmj implant conduct postmarket surveil of these devic 9 one comment urg that the total temporomandibular joint prosthesi and the interarticular implant be given high prioriti in call for pmas one comment disagre state that fda cannot give the total tmj prosthesi high prioriti in call for pmas when the panel recommend low prioriti anoth comment express concern that manufactur of these prosthes will not have to submit pmas to fda for at least 21 2 year and will be permit to market the devic in the interim pursuant to section 501 f and 515 b of the act tmj implant manufactur may continu to commerci distribut their devic without file a pma for 30 month after the effect date of the final rule classifi these implant into class iii or until 90 day after fda issu a final rule requir premarket approv for the devic whichev is later moreov section 515 i of the act show a clear congression intent that fda move forward with requir the submiss of pmas for all preamend devic thus regardless of the prioriti assign for call for pmas eventu pmas will be requir for all class iii preamend devic that are not reclassifi furthermor it should be note that a panel recommend is onli a recommend that fda may adopt or reject fda believ that it is appropri to requir pmas for all tmj implant as soon as possibl under the act 10 two comment object that the glenoid fossa prosthesi and the mandibular condyl prosthesi should not be classifi into class iii becaus the panel did not recommend that they be classifi into class iii subsequ to issu the propos rule the panel reconven on februari 11 1993 and recommend that the mandibular condyl prosthesi and the glenoid fossa prosthesi

of orchard must be all the more increas and the fertil of soil enhanc so that fruit product dure the period of adjust can be increas by 30 percent he said that the work in grow veget and basic fertil manag must be improv so that per chongbo yield can be increas consider and that the stock breed industri must be further develop to increas meat product by over 30 percent so that the problem of meat can be solv smooth the speaker talk about put great strength in fulfil the polici that light industri is the best to all the more defend reinforc and modern the light industri plant dure the period of adjust so that it potenti can be suffici manifest to normal product at a high level therefor textil product must be increas by over 20 percent shoe product by over 10 percent and food process industri must be all the more develop so that the peopl dietari life can be all the more abund and diversifi the speaker said that the consist polici of our parti and the republ govern is to activ investig and mobil local raw materi and sourc and inner reserv of the plant and enterpris in product of peopl consum good so that they can be use effect he continu to say that the weight of the product of peopl consum good through local raw materi in the local industri sector must be at a level over 70 percent and export base must be firm maintain through the mass movement to activ find sourc for export so that more foreign currenc can be earn suchul wonchonul chokkuk chajanaeo tomanun oehwarul poltaedaehaeso malhaetta the speaker talk about normal product at a high level at chemic plant and various

the immun system the cigb genet engin and biotechnolog center is one of the most import center work to develop an aid vaccin in a 62 000 squar meter facil near havana over 600 scientist most of whom are young produc 160 differ product 30 of them develop through genet engin it scientif staff has expertis in all of the modern methodolog necessari includ genet engin molecular biolog and immunolog and advanc biochemistri and it has the most advanc research and product hardwar in the world as reveal by an inspect tour of it lab and industri facil dr manuel limonta the director of the institut and of it scientif board state cuba will have an aid vaccin by 2000 or earlier he say they have a work group that is develop a vaccin against aid use genet engin technolog to prevent the diseas this is a strong group which has alreadi been work on this program for a long period of time and the group has produc signific result limonta did not describ these signific result but from other sourc we deduc that they have manag to isol and character the specif viral strain respons for hiv and that they are now in the laboratori test phase the cigb director express confid that they will manag to bring aid under control immunolog and state categor we are go to develop a vaccin dieterich steffan befor the french or american do limonta i do not know if it will happen befor but i believ it may be befor 2000 that is my person belief i think it may be earlier than that or it may be around that time that is my view of the matter if it were not dr limonta make this pronounc it might appear somewhat rash but limonta is a heavyweight in this field and his person achiev and those of the institut he direct lend author to his assert in support of this the director of the cnic nation center for scientif research dr carlo gutierrez say that limonta and his team practic live in their lab when they are tri to solv someth they are extraordinarili dedic to the work they are do and if they make such a statement they are capabl of do it he recal their achiev with interferon as an exampl when limonta work with a small team of young research propos produc interferon in cuba peopl were talk of a minimum time frame of three to four year they did it in 42 day a truli record time as everyon recogn on the lengthi list of the success of the cigb and it director mani achiev in close collabor with other cuban scientif institut there are near 160 differ product that have been develop by the cigb includ about 30 produc through genet engin from start to finish these are recombin product to convey an idea of what this mean dr limonta explain that in what is known as the third world cuba is the onli countri that has develop from start to finish product through the use of genet engin which are known and regist product and which are export such product have not been develop in ani of the other countri even in countri that are much larger than cuba like china or india just in 1993 the us patent and trademark offic in washington regist three patent for the cigb by so do it recogn the origin of the product and that cuba is the onli countri with the technolog and the methodolog to produc them it also recogn that the qualiti of these product meet the food and drug administr standard the most stringent in the world and grant cuba the exclus right to produc and sell these product in us territori for 17 year these product includ a prevent medic for myocardi infarct call estreptoquinasa regist as no 07 703 778 the first vaccin for mening bc develop anywher in the world 07 754 918 and the invertas sucros enzym which convert sugar into fructos for estreptoquinasa cuba with the except of one us firm is the onli countri that has produc this medic say limonta he explain that this product can dissolv clot in coronari arteri this medicin is capabl of elimin clot in a high percentag of patient when it is administ immedi after the infarct and it prevent the infarct from progress so it act as a prevent for myocardi infarct the patent registr for this product has alreadi been appli for in over 40 countri they are go to grant it for we know that we are the onli one who have develop an origin process to make this medic get a patent of this type reflect the high technolog capabl of our institut in this case the technolog is genet engin studi of the drug produc in the unit state have demonstr that it biolog effect is similar to that of the cuban product howev the cuban medic is much cheaper than the us drug estreptoquinasa was also develop in record time from the time when the idea was first conceiv until the product was regist as a medic onli four year elaps on the averag in cuba product are develop in less time than in us and japanes compani we have a studi done by us and japanes scientist that say that we are 13 time more product than they are in term of the time requir to complet a product and put it to use while compli with all the legal requir in practic this higher product coeffici may mean for exampl that a us or japanes product which requir 10 year for research and product may be develop in seven year in cuba the explan offer by the cuban scientist for such a surpris phenomenon is complex but they all agre that the educ and scientif philosophi of the revolut of which these young peopl are the result is the key factor anoth spectacular success of the cigb is what is known as nerv growth factor which is still not known elsewher in the world say limonta becaus nobodi els has been abl to develop it this medic a protein is use to regener nervous system damag and it could also be use in a diseas like alzheim the product has now enter the industri product phase which will enabl it to be use in clinic trial genet alter anim and plant anoth line of research the cigb is pursu is the genet modif of anim and plant to date they have produc transgen mice rabbit and fish their goal is now to produc a genet alter cow limonta explain that in these anim a new trait or genet inform is introduc in the fertil ovum which the anim assimil as it own and transmit hereditarili in this way genet chang can be produc and new speci can even be creat the specif object is to make mammal milk in this case cow milk also produc medic the cow is an excel milk produc laboratori if we can introduc in this laboratori the intellig enabl it in addit to milk to also produc specif protein then we could have for exampl interferon product in cow it all seem quit simpl we would not need a complex and cost industri interferon product process which requir the use of ferment equip close monitor etc the entir process would be done sole in the anim we would extract the product from the milk and the milk would then be use normal dieterich steffan that sound like scienc fiction limonta yes but it is go to happen i am absolut sure of it we have alreadi done it we have obtain medic in rabbit milk dieterich steffan do intern specialist know this limonta the one who read intern public do first we did this with mice to test the methodolog then we use rabbit to improv the methodolog and produc medic that was again success and now we are work to produc medic in larger anim in cow we have not done that yet but we are go to growth hormon manuel limonta also discuss the cigb progress in the control and use of growth hormon we have work on fish and in this area we realli have one of the most advanc group in the world we introduc the genet inform contain in the growth hormon in fish this caus the fish to grow veri rapid they do not reach a larger size than normal but they do so more quick becaus they incorpor their food better the time save can be half or an even larger percentag compar with the normal growth period the fish in this case tilapia a carp are still not reproduc in larg quantiti but the fundament step has been taken in the field of anim health they have creat for the first time anywher in the world a vaccin against cattl tick for which the patent is now be regist in brazil argentina mexico and other countri the develop of a vaccin against porcin colibacillosi a diseas whose mortal rate among newborn pig is 100 percent is anoth notabl scientif achiev at the present time a more advanc version of this vaccin is be develop in the area of plant health the use of biotechnolog has result in the increas of plant resist to specif pest a transgen tobacco has been produc which resist the manduca septa moth an insect that destroy the tobacco leaf with this genet modif the moth is kill without damag the leaf this is accomplish without alter the plant characterist a potato that is resist to one of the three type of virus that affect it seed is anoth cigb achiev they are now work to develop resist against the other two they have also produc a genet alter cabbag with a moth resist gene they have also develop a transgen sugarcan the first time in the world that a genet alter sugarcan has been develop to have a sugarcan that is more resist to some pest other achiev one of the cigb big achiev is the recombin vaccin against hepat b which is now use in over 20 countri in cuba it is given to all newborn as part of a nationwid program anoth complet new product now regist in cuba and some other countri but which is still not avail on the market is skin growth factor which is use to treat burn some other import product includ human monoclin antibodi for treatment and in the industri area new enzym one of these enzym is invertas sucros which transform sugar into fructos when fructos is use to sweeten or to improv flavor the amount of sugar need is reduc by 20 to 30 percent the method and technolog use for it industri applic are exclus cuban against aid on the second front against aid it diagnosi cuba has three differ techniqu the first was develop by the aid research laboratori the second by the cigb and the third by the cie immunoassay center in discuss the cigb techniqu dr limonta comment that uniqu diagnost method have been develop for exampl we have the aubio system in which a drop of blood deposit on a plastic strip react with a seri of genet engin compon we deposit on the plastic strip structur similar to the protein of the compon of the virus membran plus a gold base dye when the drop of blood come into contact with the plastic strip a chang in color is produc which indic simpli by sight whether the person has been infect this system has also been develop for use in diagnos toxoplasmosi hepat c etc and it use is now be expand to other ill it offer the advantag of not requir special equip to mix the blood and read the result and doe not even requir a technician or electr current as the result is visibl in ordinari natur light a differ method has been develop by the cie it has substanti improv the classic method of immunodiagnosi by reduc the amount of the blood sampl and reagent by 10 percent the efficaci of this diagnost method ultra micro elisa hiv has been demonstr in mani countri as well as in intern evalu by the aid refer center affili with the world health organ and paho pan american health organ for exampl in brazil canada and also in cuba itself now the cie is market an aid diagnost kit in mani countri which anyon can buy in drugstor the kit contain a paper filter a pipett to extract a blood sampl from the finger and a form the blood sampl is allow to dri on the filter the person select an anonym person code and list it on the form for exampl abc 345 and then send the dri blood sampl to a laboratori an autom reader like the cuban suma read the test and determin with a margin of accuraci of virtual 100 percent whether that person is hiv posit the person later call the laboratori give his anonym person code and receiv the result with absolut confidenti and privaci this system is now use in mani countri includ spain where it use has been approv by the ministri of health and consum affair the market price is on the averag between 20 and 30 percent less than the price of other product and the cie provid technic personnel and technic analyt or instrument assist as need this is veri conveni say the cie director of qualiti control dr rene robaina becaus when an institut like a blood bank need assist we are there we provid complet attent that includ everyth from the lab setup personnel train and later assist anoth advantag of this person aid diagnosi regist intern under the name of hipertest is that the paper filter contain the blood sampl can be sent by mail or messeng as it is high stabl onc it is dri it will last for month without the accuraci of the diagnosi be alter the hipertest is not sold in mexico but this could be done perfect well we simpli have to find a transfer mechan say robaina similar for exampl to what we have in the form of joint capit ventur in russia brazil colombia spain china ghana etc the test is produc exclus in the immunoassay center the filter paper which must have an extrem homogen qualiti is import from germani the chemic reagent also come from the world market while the biolog reagent are most produc in cuba the technolog is exclus cuban at the cnic medicin are be develop against diseas that occur becaus of the weaken of immunolog defens caus by aid we are work on medic to allevi aid we still cannot cure it say dr carlo gutierrez but we can tri to get rid of the other diseas we know there are medic that have slight lengthen the live of patient and we are tri to do that we are investig the possibl of a combin of those medic and we are now at a more advanc level than laboratori test from the laboratori we then go to bench test then to the pilot plant and final to the industri plant we are now at the bench test stage if we can produc this medic we could extend patient live more vaccin the finlay institut with an area of 23 000 squar meter unequal in latin america and one of the most modern in the world has 650 employe it develop the world first vaccin against mening and in 1990 it was award a gold model by the unit nation world intellectu properti organ for this achiev this vaccin was develop in bare five year the research had to work with live microorgan creat a high risk of infect as there is no other vaccin we took all possibl hygien precaut explain dr concepcion carma director of the institut and coordin of the research group that develop the vaccin but we had to work with larg volum of bacteria we are talk of kilogram of live bacteria that were grown in larg 300 liter ferment vat and that was a real risk the first volunt who use the vaccin were the research themselv becaus as a matter of ethic polici we believ that what we could not put in ourselv we could not ask anyon els to tri and when we test the vaccin in children we appli the same ethic standard our own children were the first one who use the vaccin onli later did we go to field test explain the doctor this vaccin is now be use in a number of latin american countri argentina chile colombia etc where mening is preval in brazil over 20 million dose have been administ without ani sever advers reaction be report in the cuban trial the vaccin demonstr an efficaci of 83 to 98 percent anoth import line of research is the anticholera vaccin which has alreadi undergon laboratori test with import result when the anim test is complet the three phase of trial with human be will begin follow by field test which will have to be done in some latin american countri as cuba is the onli countri in the hemispher where cholera doe not exist against myocardi infarct at the entri to the cnic in havana the visitor can read a statement by fidel castro the futur of our nation necessarili belong to men of scienc in this institut which is the leader and promot of cuban biotechnolog that quotat has becom a realiti as it major achiev attest among them is ppg policosanol which combat one of the princip risk factor for infarct high cholesterol level ppg which began to be market in august 1991 was develop from compon found in sugarcan whose solut have properti that reduc certain type of cholesterol at this time 200 000 cuban are use ppg regular and the result are posit in term of the patient physic psycholog and even sexual reaction the medic has now been approv for use in 12 countri and it patent applic is pend in 22 more countri each pill cost 1 and the minimum recommend dosag is one tablet a day other product whose action is similar to that of ppg the estatina mean unknown are from 15 to two time more expens they are also tri to extract from sugarcan the raw materi to produc phytosteroid in order to manufactur steroid hormon the basic element of anticontracept pill the cnic has develop the new product beyond the laboratori stage which includ test with anim and it is now in the pilot plant level anoth of the island natur resourc that is be use in biomedicin and biotechnolog is cuba coral reef sinc the cuban revolut has been care with the nation ecolog the coral are practic free from pollut dr gutierrez feel that the coral in human medicin are better than synthet materi becaus synthet materi introduc molecul that may be detriment to the human organ so at least in secondari aspect natur materi outperform artifici materi scientif studi have reveal that certain speci of coral are materi that can be use for transplant or graft due to their great biocompat with human bone tissu both becaus of their ideal architectur a porous structur that is tridimension interconnect and becaus of their physico mechan and biochem properti calcium phosphat ozon therapi a treatment develop by the cnic that is uniqu in the world is the use of ozon therapi in treat retin pigmentosa which if left untreat lead to blind with the use of ozon therapi the advanc of the diseas has been halt and patient sight has been improv we have been see patient for two year say dr gutierrez and they have not gotten wors but improv this has not been done anywher els in the world origin the equip that convert oxygen into ozon was import and cuban then develop innov applic for ozon for both therapeut and industri use at the cimeq medic and surgic research center ozon therapi is be use to dissolv compon of blood clot after five year of anim experi the treatment was appli to human be for coronari and cerebr diseas the techniqu is still in an experiment stage but it is now be use for arteri obstruct in the lower extrem as an altern to dilat or laser treatment the result have been present at intern confer in vienna pari brazil and uruguay anoth import line of research that the cnic is pursu is the use of monoclin antibodi for diagnos plant diseas for exampl there is a product that diagnos the tristeza babesia virus which attack citrus crop this diseas doe not exist in cuba but purchas of citrus fruit requir proof that the fruit doe not have this diseas by use this diagnost tool this is easi to demonstr medic equip for diagnos in clinic neurophysiolog of the central nervous system computer equip has been develop like the neuronica or medicid the neuronica is use to measur visual and auditori percept and brain wave dure sleep the medicid is veri use in analyz the nervous system and cerebr function cerebr map for exampl it provid a computer readout of electroencephalogram eeg and display the result on a monitor due to the us embargo cuban have produc all the comput program for this equip which is now in use in mexico the diram is anoth computer devic that provid a rapid microbiolog diagnosi in four hour it determin with reliabl the type of infect and it pattern of sensit to antibiot antibiogram a diagnosi that requir 72 hour when convent method are use by indic the most effect antibiot for a specif infect it avoid the develop of bacteri resist the ineffect use of antibiot and fatal outcom in serious infect becaus of the short analysi time the small volum that it requir and it low cost it is possibl to corrobor the result as often as may be desir anoth advantag of the system is that it can be use not onli for sampl of isol and purifi strain of bacteria but also for direct specimen from blood or urin cultur in first world countri equip with similar function doe exist but it is four to five time more expens the diram is faster and cheaper and cuba is now abl to export it the cie has develop the suma ultramocroanalyt system for the low cost analysi of laboratori sampl this is primarili use in the diagnosi of infecti diseas in blood bank in epidemiolog and for various health program the suma is the result of 18 year of research and the cie in havana the produc of the equip has suma laboratori in europ asia africa and latin america the equip is use to detect aid hepat b meningococcus alphafetoprotein etc in cuba the suma is use for the prenat diagnosi of virtual all pregnant women to detect congenit malform like neural tube defect and hypothyroid dengu and cholera the pedro kouri tropic medicin institut which is respons for protect the cuban popul from epidem of infecti diseas has kept ani infecti diseas from africa from spread in cuba despit the return home of ten of thousand of cuban soldier to do so high effici diagnost tool have been develop there is a diagnost system for dengu fever which is now in use in mani latin american countri report dr alina llop this rapid detect diagnost kit for antibodi is sold commerci as a kit and this is uniqu on the intern market similar kit have been develop to detect streptococcus group b which provid result in three hour in addit analys of mening infect and cholera which with convent method take no less than four day can be obtain in eight hour with the new cuban molecular biolog diagnost system cuba is probabl the onli countri in latin america that has these system anoth system of great import for the third world is a new diagnost tool for amebiasi which base on molecular biolog has a 100 percent accuraci rate this obvious elimin the uncertainti inher in convent method there are also other biomed and bioscientif area for exampl the develop of comput for medic imag in which cuba is one of the world leader young scientist the key factor that explain in the wide held opinion of the director interview the spectacular advanc of the cuban biotechnolog school is the prioriti that has been given sinc 1959 to educ and public health thank to which they now have a critic mass of young scientist of high qualiti creativ and disciplin the human factor is actual the onli element that differenti the cuban biotechnolog school from advanc laboratori in the unit state europ and japan all high tech laboratori use the same technolog equip which explain whi a visitor who enter the technolog facil of the cuban research and product center will find the same type of swiss bioreactor huge japanes electron microscop german tomograph equip and french mass spectromet that their first world counterpart have and the same thing is true for the chemic and biolog raw materi that are not produc in cuba the polit determin of the cuban state the effici network of cooper between research and product institut the unusu combin of basic and appli research as well as the strong insist that the product must meet intern standard of qualiti are all factor that have contribut to this success becaus of the us embargo cuban scientif institut have necessarili had to work with european and japanes multin with us corpor remain outsid the commerci develop of this enorm cuban potenti howev it is probabl that the us busi elit will not toler this exclus for much longer instead it will probabl opt as it did with vietnam to cooper with cuban biotechnolog and that will be the raison detr for put an end to the embargo cuba continu emerg from isol throughout latin america and europ the reconcili with the miami exil and the extraordinari intern reform are all lead in the same direct so if the cohes of the cuban model can resist for the next two or three year cuba will becom with the except of costa rica the onli latin american nation project with solid foundat enabl it to leav underdevelop behind and emerg from the backyard of the unit state for review

adopt of russia new militari doctrin evok a larg number of question in the mind of servicemen and not onli them and although all polit analysi best serv it purpos befor the fact even now it still probabl not too late to analyz the essenc and mean of the document that has becom the basic formula for the countri defens such a document has of cours been need for a long time this need aris direct from the state desir to chang it intern structur ideolog and mutual relat in addit all of russia citizen need to final be given an idea of what is happen with the militari in our countri and of what the author intend to do and not to do in shape our new militari polici and obvious the process of fundament transform in all sphere of state activ should be reflect in militari doctrin such a document was draft accord to plan in some respect and spontan in other militari doctrin matur gradual in staff work in the forc in seminar held by militari vuz higher educ insitut depart and in the research program of scientif center thousand of peopl work on it and just in 1993 six doctor and over 20 candid dissert were defend a number of scientif discoveri were made and hundr of interest propos were offer in the cours of prepar of the new militari doctrin the doctrin author had probabl been task to gather togeth and general the result of the labor of militari specialist howev the document account for none of the propos origin at the local level the convict and interest of the peopl who are to implement the doctrin the militari themselv were left unaddress which is whi it has come to be wide held in moscow academi that the new doctrin was adopt so sudden that by the veri fact of it exist it would keep ani other concept from make an appear for exampl one propos a profession armi as we know ani armi can man itself by two principl voluntarili or by compuls the russian armi has tradit form on the basi of the compulsori principl follow the lead of journalist and scientist three year ago mani general began bold say that it is imposs for a compulsori armi to becom a profession one but now the idea of a profession armi is brought to mind at the top with increas rariti cozi offic in the staff build of the old test armi which prefer to fight not with abil but with number have been found for all of the progress general the idea of strict select and high qualiti train of servicemen has been reduc to clumsi half measur like servic by enlist men on the basi of contract support neither social nor econom the contract servic program has transform into a joke discredit the veri idea of a profession armi in russia contract servic has attract chiefli those who are seek easi money or are at odd with the law both the special and the general educ train of these soldier is so low that the textbook command usual use for train in the troop are over their head press peopl into contract servic the militari commissariat fulfil the plan dictat to them from abov at ani cost even go so far as to deceiv both the contract soldier themselv and the offic under whose leadership these peopl will have to serv someth said by one of the command of a battalion man by such a conting has now swept through a good half of the armi so what did that militari commissar do make a deal with a prison camp chief the so call combin principl of man the arm forc proclaim in the new militari doctrin enabl the militari leadership to enlist the state human resourc without ani sort of qualiti control take it cue not from conscript need but from a reluct to complic it life the general dont understand that sign contract with will person isnt enough the entir system of select and combat train of soldier has to be chang fundament such a requir conflict with the fundament histor evolv method by which our troop have wage war russian general have never paid attent to loss generous fertil the futur with the bone of their soldier and this scienc of win is perhap the onli thing in which the continu of the generat of russian general clear express itself howev there is one other more import circumst the subconsci notion that the armi serv as a prison for a part of our peopl continu to foil attempt to creat profession arm forc in our countri the isol potenti of the barrack has been expert util in russia sinc day one when in past centuri a revolutionari situat evolv in finland or poland the emperor defus it by mass conscript of youngster from the restless region into the armi but we went even further conscript are conduct regular from all region it has gotten to the point where all of our men serv in the armi and all are made equal in the rank and it was onli in our countri that the word simpl sound so much like prais while complex special was perceiv as someth negat the individu was compel to conceal his uniqu and was asham of his individu keep his opinion to himself gradual he lost his abil to hold an opinion he forgot how to think he ceas think the ideal warrior how could you refus such easi to manag soldier but let return to the militari doctrin first of all let defin the locat of this document in the coordin of the countri sociopolit life in 1993 let consid the chronolog octob the tragedi at the white hous novemb the presidenti edict approv the fundament principl of militari doctrin of the russian feder decemb the nation referendum on the new constitut and elect to the russian parliament such a sequenc of event make you wonder the question that aris right away is this what should come first the fundament law of the state or it militari doctrin the answer is obvious first we adopt the constitut and then the militari doctrin if that were what happen we would certain have heard loud demand to reconcil the fundament principl of the militari doctrin to the constitut postul it would not be easi to ignor such demand at ani level of author but were the sequenc of adopt of the document to be chang as was done in our case the militari doctrin would becom a given claim prioriti of it principl over constitut principl the hand of politician in militari action have been unti for all time the arm forc turn out to be independ of the constitut and militari affair are depend screen from public scrutini the inconsist between the actual tenor of armi life and constitut norm is so astound that it requir separ discuss the new russian constitut no matter what critic it may endur nonetheless doe devot a sizabl amount of room to the individu declar the right and liberti of the individu but real militari life is character at the moment object lawless and lack of freedom the militari doctrin take no account at all of human right in ani of it premis labor is free each shall have the right do whatev he wish with his work abil and to select his natur of activ and occup compulsori labor is forbidden state articl 37 of the constitut but in the meantim the armi continu to stand on involuntari labor and the militari doctrin confirm man predomin on the basi of the compulsori principl for the forese futur or each shall have the right to freedom and inviol of the person arrest shall be base onli on court rule declar articl 22 of the constitut read this we would have to assum that our armi disciplinari regul have now been rescind and onc again the home is sacr no one shall have the right to enter a home against the will of person resid therein this is from articl 25 of the russian constitut but accord to the disciplinari regul the barrack offic dormitori are not home and privat and ncos offic resid therein are not protect by the constitut there are mani exampl of this sort also among them is a high signific one accord to articl 27 of the constitut anyon who is law present on territori of the russian feder shall have the right to travel freeli to peopl know what militari servic is like ani comment would be superflu in this regard a strang pictur develop with one hand the state give normal right and liberti to the militari as well as the rest of the citizen of russia but with it other hand it confirm a document in which these right are not foreseen which document is to be follow by a militari chief and by subordin perhap articl 45 of the constitut which state that each shall have the right to defend his right and liberti by all mean not prohibit by law our armi will becom a strang spectacl when some will be law infring upon the right of other while those other will be law defend them after all of this i have this great urg to call the militari doctrin a polit propaganda document orient on object far from those of strengthen the countri defens capabl but let wait a littl let think on this a littl more first let agre on the basic concept militari doctrin is defin as a system of view adopt by the state for a given period of time stipul in the doctrin itself upon the essenc natur and goal of possibl war and upon the program of prepar for it by the state and the arm forc the fundament principl of militari doctrin are base on the societi social and polit structur the state of it economi and the geopolit situat of the countri and it probabl adversari the militari doctrin of all state have been written on the basi of this matrix which is then fill in with the content of the polit program of the govern and rule parti of these state militari doctrin take on a mean of it own onli when the concept central to it come into be a probabl adversari then the defens program acquir it special militari orient and develop with regard for the forc and resourc of the potenti oppon it establish what forc and resourc it need for war and in prepar for it militari doctrin simpli has no mean when a probabl adversari is not defin you cant prepar for war against an unknown adversari without know the direct from which the blow might come it is imposs to organ militari profession train carri out defens measur select armament system posit the forc determin their combat readi and assign militari reconnaiss task it is imposs to set the upper limit of the materi need of the state and the armi for prepar and conduct warfar when the probabl adversari is left unnam claim by the general offic and leader of the militari industri complex upon ani given percentag of the nation incom would be justifi but in the new russian militari doctrin the probabl adversari isnt even defin approxim the author of this document believ war and militari conflict to be the main danger to stabil and peac but almost all offic with whom ive discuss the doctrin shake their head at this in bewilder doe this mean that war is what creat the danger of war but look at thing object can we realli say that russia is threaten by no one have absolut tranquil and intern harmoni realli settl over the world are there realli no countri with interest opposit to those of our state make territori econom and even polit claim upon us and where id like to know are the nuclear missil of the usa franc and england still aim and what about china arent they still aim at us isnt this also true of convent missil as well onc upon a time an adversari did attack russia catch our peopl and armi by surpris becaus the polit ambit of certain individu preclud the possibl of a profession militari approach to defens the one true lesson of histori is that no one is learn anyth from it the soviet union militari doctrin believ the develop capitalist countri and chiefli the unit state to be the probabl adversari this provid the possibl for purpos develop the economi and militari scienc and carri out polit train of the troop the correspond armi mental evolv and the profession skill of fight a specif indic adversari were practic over mani long decad by inertia mani command continu to develop these same skill in their subordin while realiz deep within their soul that such independ activ contradict all of the state polici today but what are command to do noth new has been propos to them noth differ is be taught to them noth specif is be said when ask in a recent train exercis in a certain siberian divis whom they would most like go to war with one out of everi three privat didnt have an answer while one out of everi five after some hem and haw final name the unit state or iraq or germani or china or georgia or abkhazia the most interest thing is that all of them could be right after all in addit to the tradit mission the new militari doctrin presuppos peacekeep oper station the arm forc of the russian feder outsid the countri such action are alreadi a realiti and there are serious apprehens that they could occur with much greater frequenc in the futur and then our youngster will be go to new afghanistan new angola new karabakh they will go to render intern assist to rescu some govern to correct someon mistak they will go to their death rectifi death by death whi is a probabl adversari not indic in our doctrin could it be that the countri leadership know who he is but is afraid to anger him while not be afraid to anger it own armi or have accomplish a uniqu radic revolut in all militari scienc could it be that the presid of russia and his ministri of defens have decid to the keep this oppon secret from their own armi or could it be that have no polit cours to follow no ideolog valu our politician are hope to be good friend with everyon in the intern arena there are mani supposit but there is still onli one question do the author of the new militari doctrin realiz that by not indic a probabl adversari in it and thus ask their countri and armi to prepar for war with ani old state we are will or unwil put the entir world on our list of potenti foe militari doctrin has two side sociopolit and militari technic the former embrac issu pertain to the econom social and legal principl of accomplish the goal of a futur war this side is determin by the societi main polit object but we didnt have such object at the moment of approv of the doctrin they were formul later on in the constitut therefor the militari doctrin was unabl to express the view of the state on the possibl natur of war and militari conflict or defin the principl and direct of develop of the arm forc we will find noth on the list of measur to be carri out up to the second millennium that would offer evid of the serious of plan to reform the armi and get combat capabl modern forc as a result the militari technic side of doctrin is a more utilitarian concept it includ question of the strategi and tactic of combat activ the equip suppli to the arm forc and their profession train this side of doctrin legal the complex mutual relat of armi structur with the militari industri and scientif complex and with the central and local administr and in a sens document process that have been take shape over the cours of year and decad the militari technic side of doctrin cannot object come into be befor all of these relat are fulli evolv and stabil have they alreadi stabil in the russian armi are all tie set up and work in exemplari fashion can the qualiti of the person and financi support provid to the armi today be taken as the model but the section of the doctrin that expound the concept of activ in the militari technic area is especi surpris this section is present in the new militari doctrin as if it author bear not even a suspicion of the state economi devast of the extrem deep financi crisi or of the social cataclysm had economist gone over this document befor it was cast in stone by politician and the militari had they ask their tradit question what the bottom line what is the bottom line of oper restor of the extrem expens militari infrastructur the new airfield the transport net the compon of the air defens and missil system the militari post what will be the cost of withdraw forc back into this countri and accommod them of introduc a new man system of particip in region militari conflict of make personnel chang in the arm forc and of maintain retir militari personnel whose number are continu grow with the armi reduct and that far from everyth everi item everi word of the new militari doctrin mean billion upon billion of rubl have lost much of our order of battl with the disintegr of the ussr our armi is present in a woeful state there was a time when it was built upon the principl of integr of support all theater of militari oper with unifi air defens system and air forc of conduct combat oper with regard for the possibl of the navi and strateg missil forc these principl have now been violat such an armi no longer exist troop and equip of the strongest first line district depart togeth with ukrain and belarus which total devast the complex structur of the countri entir defens and laid bare the western sector the tragic event in the caucasus in the dnestr region and in azerbaijan and tajikistan sever all line of communic almost entir thus depriv the dozen of unit station in these region of the possibl of conduct combat activ these format are feel the shortag of personnel more and more keen in turn the absenc of resourc and of proper person condit make it imposs for the ministri of defens to reloc ground forc and form some sort of workabl system out of them the strateg missil forc have found themselv in a situat in which a signific fraction of their launcher are on the other side of russia border moreov all such facil requir the constant attent of specialist whom no cis countri but russia has imagin what await the launcher in the absenc of constant mainten and how is such mainten to be carri out abroad how are these facil to be transfer to the other countri if they are control from a singl center how much resourc will it take to reorient the flight assign in order to plug the hole form in our countri nuclear missil shield still despit everyth and owe exclus to the heroism of their own offic the russian missil forc are maintain their combat readi the countri air defens system which has been ravag by numer reorgan is in dire need of radic improv of all of it technic resourc and of more effect coordin of it action with other arm forc strateg aviat suffer from a shortag of fuel and personnel and it chronic lack the resourc for practic train of specialist torn apart by conflict the navi is desper tri to preserv it uniti and fight capabl and to reject the old combat equip other insist it must accept the armi has been strangl by hous and person problem offic havent been paid for sever month there are not enough enlist men and mestnichestvo dedovshchina harass and favorit flourish in the unit servicemen uproot from russian soil have lost all hope of return to their motherland the are in despair the one thing they have been capabl of is arm defens of their children their wive and their famili against band of nationalist in these time have taken upon itself the inordin burden of maintain order along the border of the former ussr russia is current maintain more troop abroad includ border guard than ani other countri in the world after the civil war at the begin of the period of the new econom polici lenin reduc the armi from 5 million to 550 000 that is by almost 10 time but this took more than just a singl year as of the moment of their establish by an edict of the russian presid date 7 may 1992 the arm forc number around 3 million person by 1995 their numer strength is suppos to be not more than 2 million but such a downward progress is not to be observ on the contrari the administr machineri of the russian ministri of defens seem to have alreadi surpass that which exist in the soviet armi in term of both number of worker and quantiti of general grade posit the equip situat is also critic of the five and a half thousand tank in the russian armi around a thousand are practic unus dure the next year half of the tank will becom obsolet from a militari standpoint there is noth with which to replac them of 7 000 infantri fight vehicl and 6 500 artilleri system over a third requir immedi overhaul the full thousand of our helicopt gunship requir immedi repair and mainten this list can go on and on and even so these are noth more than the general statist behind each one of them stand the tragedi of peopl depriv of the possibl of do their work in mani of the unit all of this is believ to be the result of intrigu by our enemi conspiraci and betray here and there we hear appeal for action could it be that our command have an avers to rend foreign uniform with russian bayonet young hot blood lieuten cant understand whi everyon is calm watch as thing of valu that had taken year to creat are be destroy turn insid out and sold for a pittanc in a singl moment how mani pack of chew gum can you get for a gyro stabil strateg nuclear missil launcher or for a mobil armi command post that not an idl question such deal have been made yes russia has alway trade in arm just in the 1980s for exampl the militari industri complex sold over 6 000 tank 20 000 gun 17 submarin and thousand of airplan to foreign countri through it weapon sale the ussr control the geopolit map of the world shore up and set up regim and maintain or reliev tension in certain region but the process was kept under meticul control and the weapon were care account for each cartridg was account the loss of a singl pistol was consid to be an incid of the gravest import one to be report to the main command follow disintegr of the ussr the armi wrote off around a third of all of it militari equip and armament within a year it was scrap hidden and stolen for subsequ sale but in order to sell weapon thoughtless you first have to sell your conscienc who know how mani ten of dollar the conscienc of a russian offic cost today whether the author of the doctrin like it or not the individu along with his own philosophi and interest remain the decis factor of modern warfar it is no secret to anyon that all of the world larg armi invest enorm resourc into shape a sens of patriot in their soldier a system of spiritu valu and particular polit convict no matter what anyon say about depolitic the armi all of this is accomplish through a system of indoctrin which exist in everi armi of everi state indoctrin is an attribut of an armi a mean of control the arm forc i know of veri few except to this rule and when it get down to the larg arm forc and countri there is but one except russia the destruct of our old system of militari indoctrin is almost complet and it is continu listen to what im say it is not be chang it is not be rework but it is be destroy the former system was of cours oversatur by ideolog it total exclud creativ and it was built on a pure talmud like foundat but at least it was well conceiv and armi indoctrin consist shape the armi cultur which was root in soviet tradit and custom they were express in the form of numer militari custom and courtesi from the simplest salut to the most complex the militari oath taken in a solemn situat holiday parad and so on have becom divest of the ideolog principl of communism the onc perfect system of troop indoctrin immedi lost mean and transform into the tatter cloth of the armi this process was help along consider by organiz measur direct at the former main polit director hatchet job reorgan and personnel chang in the director for educ work with personnel persecut of polit worker in the forc and mani other clumsi action by arm forc reform togeth with the old system of indoctrin the armi reform did in all of militari cultur no one gave ani thought to what was to replac it the russian armi doe not have it own intern militari cultur it is attempt to uncondit inject new polit mean into old armi custom and courtesi and it is trade soviet flag for russian one but all of the custom all of the courtesi are rigid determin by their tradit communist content and noth new is be ad and without intern armi cultur it would be naiv to discuss organ and combat readi of the arm forc no one has yet suggest a system for the armi under which peopl would be brought togeth not by a depend upon an idea but by the idea itself and without uniti without uniti of thought it is imposs to have a modern armi let me also add that all indoctrin is insepar from the train process becaus offic and general didnt know how to indoctrin their subordin or in what they have lost their possibl for teach them militari affair per se in organ high qualiti fashion how did it happen that the undermin socioeconom and moral tenet of the armi went unreflect on the page of this import state document how is the high import formula of defens go to work how about the formula of victori the import thing now is whos victori over whom what make the new militari doctrin fundament differ is that it give the presid and govern the right to use the arm forc to fight not onli a foreign but even an intern foe to put it simpli this militari doctrin give the armi permiss to shoot at civilian to use mighti armi weapon against them it may be possibl that they will now begin give combat decor for this the unpreced level of freedom that the author of the doctrin give to the militari polit leadership or leader in independ choos the adversari both outsid the state and within it is simpli frighten the militari has been given unlimit possibl and it has been shown unpreced trust but thank god this is no joy to offic they have no wish to shoot at civilian no matter what their convict no matter what their behavior if someon violat the law we have the militia the omon special purpos militia detach and the secur servic whi the militari the armi is suppos to fight anoth armi and not anyon els this uniqu featur of the militari doctrin explain to some degre all of it preced contradict if the arm forc are to be use to fight an intern enemi the absenc of mani concept from the doctrin familiar to militari peopl is fulli natur and justifi a ministri that is bent on forc and take aim into it own countri has need of neither the sociopolit nor the militari technic side of polici a ministri of this kind has other object a differ system of prepar true in civil countri the armi doe not perform intern function in czarist russia for exampl such function were perform by a gendarmeri and it did quit well without militari doctrin but even in instruct follow by the gendarmeri the probabl adversari the potenti violat of the peac was clear defin he was an anarchist or a social democrat a socialist revolutionari or a bundist do those who wrote this present doctrin realiz that by not indic ani probabl adversari within the countri they have thus wit or unwit finger all polit parti all social group as the probabl adversari of the arm forc and doesnt that mean all of the russian peopl", "score":

ordinari diet session on 4 march live text ever sinc my govern was form in august 1993 i have work for the three reform of polit reform administr reform and econom reform under the banner of respons chang with one era end yet the emerg shape of the era to come yet unclear we have no choic but to take the initi in identifi new path so as to ensur a bright outlook for the futur have chosen the path of chang and it demand that we remak polit the economi and our societi those of us respons for govern at this histor junctur have a duti to forg ahead no matter how great the difficulti polit reform was this govern first prioriti issu and the passag of the amend to the polit reform law repres a major step toward the attain of new and respons polit make everi effort to ensur that the law are implement smooth i intend with the consent of both hous of this diet to appoint the member of the hous of repres elect district advisori commiss soon and then onc their recommend are receiv to prompt submit legisl to this diet for the actual redistrict of cours i need not remind you that the real basi for root out polit corrupt and reestablish trust in polit fundament has to lie in each and everi politician have a strong ethic sens it is sad inde that there are still widespread suspicion of structur linkag between money and polit as seen in the so call construct scandal and i believ it would be inexcus should we fail to enact more effect anticorrupt measur and other system reform polit reform is the framework within which we can achiev respons chang and we have onli just reach the start line for those real reform where polit must take the initi realiz how littl time there is until the 21st centuri it is clear that we must move steadfast toward creat a societi of qualiti and substanc that will have the intern communiti trust in lay the foundat for a new era of develop it is first imper that we demolish those system and practic that are no longer compat with the need of the time now that we have made some progress on polit reform it is essenti that we make a determin effort for econom reform and administr reform both for ourselv and so that we can fulfil our respons to the intern communiti i thus intend to take up the gauntlet of new reform not forget the essenti spirit of this reform govern the thing that the peopl most ardent desir now is an escap from this grim recess although there are some bright spot the overal pictur remain one of uncertainti and dead ended and we cannot take our econom futur for grant within this we must pay special attent to the grim employ pictur it is thus crucial that we deploy all possibl effect polici measur in a concert and time manner to work our way out of this situat thus it was that we recent drew up the comprehens packag of econom measur amount to an unpreced 15 trillion yen includ incom and resid tax cut and addit measur under the third supplement budget dovetail this into the budget for fiscal 1994 we must now achiev seamless fiscal expenditur and get the economi on the road to recoveri as soon as possibl along with ensur strong growth for public work spend and local govern project in consider of the state of the economi the fiscal 1994 budget propos repres a determin effort to promot social infrastructur improv in prepar for the advent of the age societi includ prioriti invest in hous water and sewer system park environment facil and other area impact direct to improv the qualiti of japanes life everi possibl consider has also been paid to polici to support hard press farmer and small businesspeopl and to stabil employ given the critic state of the economi i veri much hope that this budget propos will be enact as soon as possibl in addit to cyclic factor and the collaps of the specul bubbl this recess is said to have been exacerb by structur factor in that mani of those econom structur that use to work so ration are no longer effect dynam develop in the privat sector the main player in the japanes economi is essenti if we are to resolv this problem and the ensur long term develop i am confid that the privat sector will face the current difficulti unflinch and will be abl to overcom them and it is to encourag and support these effort that we must promot econom reform that clarifi the medium term outlook will be conduc to busi restructur and the creation and develop of new industri look specif at deregul we intend to move toward make nonregul the norm and regul the except in the econom sphere and to be constant review social regul so as inter alia to expand busi opportun and broaden consum choic and to enhanc purchas power by reduc the dispar between japanes and oversea price we will take dramat action with the prioriti on those area that relat to promot the more effect and appropri use of land and encourag hous construct that stimul the creation of new busi in inform telecommun and other area that relat to reduc the dispar between japanes and oversea price in such area as distribut and energi and that affect import promot at the same time we will work for the rigor enforc of the antimonopoli law to elimin those anticompetit practic that are a caus of japan higher price and that inhibit the creation of new busi opportun and foreign access to japan administr reform is an urgent issu that cannot be avoid as we seek to reform japanes socioeconom structur and make them better suit to the new era while there is general agreement that japanes administr structur and system function effect for our develop from the end of the war until recent these structur and system have not alway been abl to respond adequ to the strike transform in the socioeconom climat and the major chang in popular need it is imposs for administr alon to stand unchang when there are such major chang take place in polit and the economi seek to establish administr that is fair transpar and abov all has the popular interest as it first prioriti now is the time for us to initi radic surgeri on our administr structur and system start with deregul as an interfac between the government and nongovernment sector and consid noth sacr i intend to reexamin all of those system and structur that have not kept up with the time and to promot sweep reform includ redelin government and nongovern role redefin the relationship between the central and local govern and correct the impedi pose by our over compartment bureaucraci as well as to make an effort for the greater disclosur of administr inform so far we have spent an enorm amount of time on discuss at various venu includ the second extraordinari administr research council and the administr reform council howev it is also true that there has been critic say that not enough has been accomplish in administr reform while we are submit legisl to this session of the diet to establish a committe on administr reform i have resolv that the question befor us is that of how to achiev effect administr reform and am determin to promot visibl administr reform while i believ that our decis to implement the largest ever incom tax and resid tax cut was both necessari and justifi given the current econom situat that doe not give us licens to be irrespons about the veri serious fiscal situat that will exist at the end of fiscal 1994 includ nation bond outstand in excess of 200 trillion yen and a substanti overhang of local govern bond it is imper that the peopl understand that we cannot let the fiscal situat deterior uncheck and cannot leav futur generat sever indebt if we are to avoid impair the economi vital and are to respond appropri to the need of the time even with an age societi it is essenti that we press forward with fiscal reform and continu to work to ensur sound fiscal manag and further effort will be need to creat a fiscal structur in which the valu of nation bond outstand doe not continu to rise and rise at the same time we must also work for the smooth manag of local financ as well thus it is that in tandem with administr reform we are promot thorough ration and priorit of expenditur on tax reform we are work to promot discuss on the broad rang of issu involv includ the nation burden and the tax system tax cut and how to financ them and how to distribut the tax burden appropri and equit and hope to reach a consensus soon and to get the relev legisl enact by the diet by the end of the year so as to institut a balanc tax structur combin incom consumpt asset and other tax and to achiev a vigor and affluent welfar societi i would like to make specif propos in the three area of i structur societi for boundless creativ individu ii structur the foundat for a life of abund and qualiti and iii structur societi so that older mean more vigor look at the world to come i suspect the groundswel of divers individu will give birth to new cultur and econom activ and that will in turn becom the fountainhead of new vital at the same time this will constitut an import foundat enabl japan to behav and to contribut as a respons member of the intern communiti now is the time for us to achiev new advanc in scienc and technolog educ and inform telecommun so as to achiev this new develop scienc and technolog is the drive forc for the economi and the stuff of dream for the futur creat an environ in which scientist and engin can engag creativ in the work they love is thus an indispens invest in the futur it is often said that japan lag behind in basic research and lead edg research but i believ japan should play a leadership role includ intern cooper in space life scienc the environ energi and other research area look ahead to the 21st centuri thus it is that in addit to enhanc research facil and the inform infrastructur i want to further improv the provis for research and develop includ educ for boundless creativ peopl and intern cooper at the same time i would like to make japan a societi that radiat cultur a societi in which each individu region and the state project rich distinct cultur that japan can be proud of intern and that work through cross fertil for new cultur creation accord i will work to promot cultur artist and sport activ such as foster young artist and promot cultur activ distinct to each region in addit i will place a high prioriti on promot human resourc develop and intern cultur exchang by for exampl promot the program to accommod 100 000 foreign student by the begin of the next centuri further enhanc languag educ and develop human resourc in connect with our assist program so as to creat a climat of dialogu in which we and our global neighbor can understand and accept our divers better use educ to foster rich individu peopl is basic to creat a high cultur countri there are mani view of japanes educ includ that it is over uniform or that it discourag initi and i want to promot educ reform aim at creat more attract and open educ from the earliest year through univers graduat one of the area in which it is hope that creativ econom activ will open the way to new develop in the year to come is that of inform telecommun with the recent rapid technolog advanc inform is no longer limit by either space or time and it is like that we will be abl to achiev a societi earli in the 21st centuri revolution life and busi as we now know them yet the fact is that japanes inform telecommun has unfortun not live up to expect thus it is that i want to draw up a new vision for the kind of inform societi that we seek from the long term perspect as soon as possibl to make better use of inform technolog in the public sector and to develop a comprehens packag of measur includ promot the develop of inform telecommun network fuse broadcast and telecommun and promot inform educ it should be note that i will also work steadili to support the creation of new busi opportun in the inform telecommun sector by for exampl encourag small busi to go into new field work for flexibl labor market activ the financi and secur market and promot bold restructur japan has grown to be the world second strongest econom power but i suspect mani of the peopl do not yet have a sens of true affluenc in their daili live peopl in the out area feel they have fewer job opportun than in the big citi and that they do not have the same conveni access to cultur and educ opportun and mani peopl in the big citi feel their live are blight by the unafford of qualiti hous the trauma of commut and other problem among the caus here are the overconcentr of function in the tokyo area and the inadequaci of social infrastructur relat to everyday life and it is essenti that we move quick to institut effect polici in this area i believ the import thing here is that each region take the initi in exercis ingenu to creat attract communiti and that we improv the infrastructur for balanc develop throughout japan for this to happen the first point is that local govern close to the peopl must take the lead in solv their resid problem which mean we must make a determin effort to promot decentr includ enhanc local govern financ i thus want to draw up a basic polici outlin by the end of the year detail the basic philosophi the issu to be address and the procedur to be follow includ the possibl of new legisl work for the creation of a multicent countri i also want to promot the dispers of urban and industri function to out area and to encourag the creation of effici high speed road rail and air transport network link hub citi nationwid to promot develop for underpopul and mountain region and more along with work for the further enhanc of conserv and the total rang of disast prevent polici i will also continu to work vigor for hokkaido overal growth and for okinawa develop it is imper that we further enhanc the live relat infrastructur direct relat to provid greater conveni so that all peopl everywher can have tangibl sens of affluenc no matter where they live for exampl we will seek to lower hous cost by promot a dramat restructur of the hous industri hous import and other mean and will work to promot the more effici and systemat use of land space so that peopl can live in bigger hous that feel less cramp and offer greater conveni at the same time it is necessari to steadfast promot improv in road park water and sewer system wast dispos plant and other amen and improv in intrac rail carri capac and other social infrastructur to allevi commut crowd the environment and energi issu are not onli import issu for those of us aliv today but must be dealt with in consider of futur generat and the whole of the global communiti i thus want to draw up the basic environ law and to move to implement comprehens polici as soon as possibl so that we can bequeath a beauti environ and the bounti of natur to futur generat likewis i want in tandem with energi conserv and the faster develop and use of altern energi sourc to promot the peac use of nuclear energi premis upon assur safeti the everyday safeti and secur that we enjoy in our live is an asset that japan can be proud of and preserv this is one of the govern import respons yet just as the crime pictur has late becom quit grim with the increas vicious and ingenu of organ crimin element the increas frequenc of drug relat incid and shoot and the fact that crime has becom less local and more intern we are also record larg number of traffic death i intend to be unstint in my effort to maintain public order and to ensur public safeti at the same time i intend to submit comprehens consum protect and relief legisl includ the adopt of product liabil rule to this session of the diet so as to enhanc consum interest in regard to product safeti from the perspect of put the consum first if there is anxieti about the fact that japan now has the longest lifespan in the world and will soon becom the world first societi to have veri larg number of old peopl and veri few children this anxieti is polit respons if we are to achiev a vigor and cheer welfar societi in the 21st centuri it is import that we draw up a comprehens age societi welfar vision strike a balanc among pension fund health care welfar provis and the other essenti

bode well for the world economi futur that the gatt uruguay round was final conclud last decemb after more than seven year of negoti in conclud these negoti japan accept the draft agreement on agricultur therebi accord rice special treatment regard tariff and subject other agricultur product to tariff this was a most heartrend decis made after strenuous consider in recognit of the broader

space rich in tradit and local cultur water fill paddi and sheav of ripe rice are symbol of japan and rice farm also play a crucial role in land conserv and environment protect thus i believ it is now

the medium term while the road to world peac and stabil is by no mean smooth our cours is gradual becom clearer as the intern communiti pool it wisdom and it effort toward it common goal inde the peac

requir health care provid who administ certain vaccin and manufactur of the vaccin to report specifi advers experi occur within specifi time interv after administr of the vaccin these advers experi report are submit to vaer which is joint manag by fda and cdc and becam oper on novemb 1 1990 a form vaer 1 was develop for these report when the requir set forth in both 600 80 and ncvia necessit report of an advers event licens manufactur of vaccin are not requir to submit duplic report to vaer and fda submiss of the report to vaer is suffici howev licens manufactur of vaccin must compli with the regul in 600 80 therefor ani requir in these regul that are in addit to those specifi in the ncvia must be satisfi for exampl although ncvia doe not specifi the time period for submiss of advers experi report the time period set forth in 600 80 appli to report be submit to vaer 4 request for waiver six comment request waiver from the report requir for specif type of advers experi or for certain categori of biolog product these request for waiver were with respect to part or all of the requir of propos 600 80 in addit one comment request that the final rule specifi the provis for

21 cfr 314 90 the provis for waiver for drug or antibiot manufactur and other interest person should submit request for waiver as provid in 600 90 of the final rule 5 econom assess one comment request clarif of fdas estim of the cost of compli with the report requir of the propos rule of approxim 255 490 the compani estim that it cost in labor and overhead would be approxim 40 000 in contrast anoth comment state that the compani did not anticip that this report requir would signific alter the manner in which compani would share their postmarket inform with fda the agenc assess of cost was made over 4 year ago when both the number of approv biolog product was fewer and cost somewhat less in addit the agenc figur did not take into account overhead and other cost associ with basic manufactur practic everi respons manufactur and distributor regardless of the type of product manufactur implement a mean to receiv inquiri about the qualiti and advers effect of it product as good manufactur practic and as an accept part of do busi therefor this cost has not been includ in assess the cost of this regul the cost assess for this regul onli relat to the specif cost incur by the requir in the regul which are in addit to customari busi practic the cost of the regul are for prepar of the specif report and analys requir by the regul and do not includ the normal oper and overhead cost of do busi the revis econom assess is discuss at the end of this preambl b definit section 600 80 a 1 advers experi four comment request clarif of the definit of advers experi in propos 600 80 a particular the phrase signific failur of expect pharmacolog action whether or not consid product relat one comment state that the word signific has one mean in the definit of advers experi and anoth statist mean in the usag of the term increas frequenc in propos 600 80 c 1 ii and request that the word be use consist with the same mean throughout the regul anoth comment request a definit of signific failur as use in the definit of advers experi one comment request that the definit be amend to requir report of chang in failur rate instead of ani signific failur one comment gave the follow exampl of incid that would be consid an advers experi with ani signific failur a patient who die of acut myocardi infarct in spite of thrombolyt therapi or a patient who die of congest heart failur despit diuret therapi ie death from progress of the indic diseas one comment state that it concur with the agenc definit of advers experi becaus it doe not includ loss of respons as an advers experi the comment goe on to state that loss of immun over time from a vaccin is not logic an advers event the agenc agre that the word signific when use in this context is a sourc of confus and ambigu to elimin this sourc of confus and to encourag the report of all advers experi fda revis 314 80 to delet the word signific from the definit of advers experi in the report requir for drug see 57 fr 17950 april 28 1992 and is revis the definit of advers experi in this final rule by delet the word signific the agenc is retain the propos languag in the definit of advers experi instead of adopt the suggest to requir report onli of chang in failur rate becaus a chang in failur rate can onli be determin retrospect a chang in failur rate is to be report in an increas frequenc report howev a failur of expect pharmacolog action that caus a serious and unexpect advers experi in human should be report within 15 day regardless of the rate of such report the agenc believ that the exampl given may or may not indic a failur of expect pharmacolog action for exampl patient with congest heart failur often have irrepar kidney damag which even the most potent diuret cannot overcom in such a situat congest heart failur would not be a failur of expect pharmacolog action howev the extent of pre exist kidney damag and the degre to which kidney failur may be expect would be demonstr through kidney function test prior to medic therefor fda is not amend the definit of advers experi as request the agenc agre partial with the comment regard loss of respons if loss of immun over time is the expect pharmacolog action of the vaccin then it is not an advers experi if loss of immun is due to a patient compromis immun system this also would not be consid an advers experi howev loss of immun due to an unexpect failur of the pharmacolog action of the vaccin therebi leav recipi suscept to a communic diseas is an advers experi and should be report the guidelin point out that for purpos of advers event report lack of effect is general synonym with failur to produc the expect pharmacolog action certain product are indic for immun through a recommend cours of sever dose to achiev a specifi level of antibodi titer to provid seroprotect in this case lack of effect is synonym with failur to produc the expect pharmacolog action onli when adequ seroconvers is not achiev follow the final dose 2 blood compon one comment note that the languag in the propos 600 80 l 1 and preambl refer to blood compon yet the section of the cfr upon which the exempt is predic 606 170 refer to blood product the comment specif ask whether albumin and immunoglobulin are exempt from the rule and request clarif of the mean of blood compon in 600 80 a fda is clarifi the regul by ad in 600 80 a of the final rule a refer to 21 cfr 606 3 c which defin a blood compon as that part of a singl donor unit of blood separ by physic or mechan mean the exempt in 600 80 l for report advers experi associ with blood compon doe not includ product deriv from pool blood such as albumin or immunoglobulin therefor albumin and immunoglobulin are biolog product subject to this rule in a futur issu of the feder regist fda intend to propos revis to 606 170 concern report relat to blood collect or transfus 3 disabl two comment request that a definit for disabl be includ in 600 80 a as the phrase perman disabl is use in the definit of serious the agenc agre that the term disabl should be defin and is propos a definit in the notic of propos rulemak found elsewher in this issu of the feder regist 4 increas frequenc four comment on propos 600 80 a request clarif of the definit for increas frequenc two comment state that the propos definit of increas frequenc as an increas in the rate of occurr is mislead inasmuch as the rate of occurr cannot be determin by a spontan report system two comment request that the definit of increas frequenc take into account an adjust for product exposur the agenc agre with these comment and is revis the definit in 600 80 a as follow increas frequenc mean an increas in the rate of occurr of a particular advers biolog product experi after appropri adjust for exposur to the biolog product 5 life threaten one comment request that a definit for life threaten be includ similar to that found in 21 cfr 312 32 the agenc agre and is propos a definit of life threaten in the notic of propos rulemak found elsewher in this issu of the feder regist 6 serious three comment note discrep between the preambl 600 80 a of the propos rule report form fda 1639 and the draft guidelin regard the mean of the

determin whether all overdos should be includ in the definit and determin that not all overdos are serious in resolv the discrep in the definit of serious regard inpati hospit the agenc determin that prolong inpati hospit should be includ as a serious advers event fda is propos a revis of the definit of serious to exclud the term overdos and to includ requir or prolong inpati hospit in the notic of propos rulemak found elsewher in this issu of the feder regist the term disabl is discuss in section iii 3 of this preambl 7 signific one comment request that a definit for the word signific which compens for chang in use pattern be includ in 600 80 a the comment is in refer to the use of the term signific in the increas frequenc alert report the agenc agre in part with this comment the agenc consid signific in this context to mean a notic or measur increas in frequenc after adjust for document chang in use pattern howev the agenc is not codifi this definit in 600 80 a becaus signific may have a differ mean in a differ context within advers experi report the guidelin provid clarifi exampl util a formula and tabl to determin if there is a signific increas in frequenc of an advers experi 8 clarif between product defect and advers experi one comment request clarif regard the definit in 600 80 a for advers experi and the report of product defect the definit of advers experi in 600 80 a specifi that the advers experi must be associ with the use of a biolog product in human therefor product defect either discov in the manufactur process or not associ with an advers experi in human are not subject to this regul these defect may be report under good manufactur practic regul cover in 21 cfr 600 14 howev product defect which result in an advers experi in a human are subject to report under 600 80 c review of advers experi section 600 8 b 1 report by scientif paper or competitor one comment on propos 600 80 b state that to place respons on the licens manufactur for review of all advers experi inform pertain to it product from ani sourc includ publish and unpublish scientif paper is both time consum and possibl open to abus by competitor the comment went on to state that if an unsubstanti mail from a competitor alleg advers or unexpect experi the licens manufactur becom subject to the entir 15 day alert procedur includ the need to conduct if not actual report to fda the followup investig one comment ask the agenc to specifi the degre of vigor that licens manufactur should use to pursu report of advers experi in the scientif literatur section 600 80 b is not intend to requir licens manufactur to discov everi publish and unpublish report on it product howev onc a report of an advers experi is made known to the licens manufactur it is the licens manufactur respons to compli with the requir in 600 80 regardless of the sourc of the advers experi report it is accept for the licens manufactur to come to the conclus that the mail or public alleg an advers experi is fals or mislead and report this conclus to the agenc in some case the agenc may take appropri regulatori action against person prepar a fals or mislead report of an advers experi 2 lack of respons

comment suggest that the analysi is not of the increas frequenc of advers experi but rather the analysi is of the increas frequenc of report of advers experi one comment request that the agenc develop improv method for determin increas frequenc that would account for fluctuat in report fda agre that increas frequenc of advers experi report doe not necessarili correl with an increas in advers experi case report are use to alert the agenc about area which may need further investig fda take into account the fact that report rate vari over time in postmarket surveil when analyz the report rate for an individu biolog fda doe not assum that an increas in incid of advers experi will automat trigger an increas in report of advers experi nor doe the agenc assum that an increas in the number of report of advers experi necessarili indic an increas in incid of advers experi the agenc believ that an increas in report rate when taken into account with other relev inform may indic that an

that would regular provid adequ inform about use of prescript drug in pediatr patient as state in the preambl to the propos rule on which this final rule is base howev most prescript drug product still lack adequ inform about their use in pediatr popul for exampl an inform survey done in 1990 by the american academi of pediatr examin label of all new molecular entiti approv between 1984 and 1989 and found that 80 percent had no inform on pediatr use other survey have shown that the label for mani prescript drug state that safeti and effect in children have not been establish and contain

as a result pediatr patient may be expos to an increas risk of advers reaction or decreas effect of the drug prescrib or may be deni access to valuabl therapeut agent the continu absenc of pediatr use inform in prescript drug label may be due in part to the impress perhap convey by the exist regul that pediatr claim must alway be base on adequ and well control studi conduct in the pediatr popul given the mani problem associ with the test of drug in the pediatr popul eg obtain inform consent for test not direct of benefit to the child use of placebo control in a vulner popul studi meet this standard are often difficult to obtain exist fda regul do not in fact requir that control trial alway be conduct in the pediatr popul to support a pediatr use under current 201 57 f 9 the need for

becaus the term children can be interpret as refer onli to a particular subset of the pediatr popul age 2 to 12 year and to make clear that the provis of this rule appli to the entir pediatr popul refer to children in the propos rule have been delet and replac by pediatr popul or pediatr patient the major provis of the final rule are summar as follow the final rule continu to permit a specif pediatr indic ie an indic differ from those approv in adult support by adequ and well control studi in the appropri pediatr popul to be describ under the indic and usag section of the label with the

the drug differ between pediatr and adult respons to the drug and other inform relat to the safe and effect use of the drug in pediatr patient if there are specif statement on pediatr use of the drug for an indic also approv for adult that are base on adequ and well control studi in the pediatr popul they must be summar in the pediatr use subsect of the label and discuss in more detail if appropri under the clinic pharmacolog and clinic studi section appropri pediatr dosag must be given under the dosag and administr section of the label this subsect of the label must also cite ani limit on the pediatr use statement need for specif monitor specif hazard associ with use of the drug in ani subset of the pediatr popul eg neonat differ between pediatr and adult respons to the drug and other inform relat to the safe and effect pediatr use of the drug a pediatr use statement may also be base on adequ and well control studi in adult provid that the agenc conclud that the cours of the diseas and the drug effect are suffici similar in the pediatr and adult popul to permit extrapol from the adult efficaci data to pediatr patient where need pharmacokinet data to allow determin of an appropri pediatr dosag and addit pediatr safeti inform must also be submit where the requir for a find of substanti evid to support a specif pediatr indic or a pediatr use statement have not been met for a particular pediatr subgroup the pediatr use subsect of the label must contain a statement that appropri character the limit such as safeti and effect in pediatr patient below the age of year month week have not been establish if use of the drug is associ with a specif hazard in this pediatr subgroup the pediatr use subsect must contain inform about this hazard or where appropri refer to a more complet descript of the hazard in the contraind or warn section of the label where the requir for a find of substanti evid to support a pediatr indic or a pediatr use statement have not been met for ani pediatr popul the pediatr use subsect of the label must contain the follow statement safeti and effect in pediatr patient have not been establish if use of the drug in prematur or neonat infant or other pediatr subgroup is associ with a specif hazard the pediatr use subsect must contain inform about this hazard or where appropri refer to a more complet descript of the hazard in the contraind or warn section of the label ani sponsor who believ that no pediatr use subsect is appropri or relev to the label of it particular drug product must provid fda with reason justifi it omiss and may propos altern statement s final recogn the hazard that inact ingredi can pose to the pediatr popul the final rule requir that prescript drug label contain statement about inact ingredi that might be toxic to the neonat or other pediatr subgroup iii general comment on the propos rule fda receiv 11 comment on the propos rule from prescript drug manufactur prescrib profession societi organ with special interest in the pediatr popul the lay public and other most support the propos label chang call it time and import an import step to facilit the inclus of inform about use of drug in children in the approv label a signific step toward the goal of includ infant and children in the drug approv process and a way to fill the gap of inform that current exist in the area of appropri drug usag in children one comment for exampl state that provid pediatr use inform in label will help health profession reach ration drug therapi decis for pediatr patient the comment ad ani inform that can be use by pharmacist to assur ration drug therapi in special popul will be a posit addit to drug inform such label will enhanc the likelihood of posit outcom in pediatr patient howev some comment were less support includ one that state while we commend the fda on it initi to improv inform avail to physician and their pediatr patient regard prescript drug use we remain concern that this approach will not measur assist physician most comment also rais specif issu for consider by the agenc these issu are describ below a definit of pediatr 1 sever comment suggest that age breakdown within the pediatr popul might be appropri the pediatr age rang begin at birth and may cover individu as old as 18 year to 21 year encompass the subspecialti of neonatolog and adolesc medicin one comment suggest that the rule defin pediatr as children under 12 year becaus it has been common accept that age 12 year to 18 year may be includ without previous clinic work in that age group the comment also suggest that the rule state the age group when pharmacokinet studi should be done in order to extrapol the result from infanc through adolesc or state whether the age rang will be broken into subgroup with test requir for each anoth comment said that a definit of pediatr would have to consid drug metabol pharmacokinet and interact with various organ and other bodi system the comment suggest that a system by which distinct class of drug are consid differ may be more logic and appropri anoth comment note that pediatr patient are not homogen and that age group show signific differ in function and physiolog function the comment suggest that inform from clinic studi be subdivid by age group and their respect respons to drug suggest age categori of prematur infant newborn children under 2 year of age children 2 year to 13 year and adolesc 13 year to 18 year anoth comment said that individu 16 year to 18 year of age pose particular problem and suggest consult with the american academi of pediatr committe on drug to consid defin age categori or group for pediatr label the pediatr use subsect of label is where inform about use of a drug in pediatr patient is locat and 201 57 f 9 describ in general term the kind of inform that should be includ the pediatr use subsect doe not attempt to resolv the mani difficult issu relat to use of drug in this popul what appear in this subsect eg age group cover will depend on the data avail and the abil to defin result for specif subgroup as a general matter howev the agenc offer the follow guidanc and use breakdown the follow age categori for the pediatr popul are common distinguish although the distinct are inevit arbitrari 1 birth up to 1 month neonat 2 1 month up to 2 year of age infant 3 2 year up to 12 year children and 4 12 year up to 16 year adolesc where possibl data should be analyz by these group but it should not usual be necessari to establish a drug product effect in each group it may on the other hand be import to have some pharmacokinet inform in each group especi the younger age group to guid dose and addit inform such as a specif studi in neonat to establish safeti although the agenc has determin that the term pediatr patient refer to individu from birth to 16 year of age the agenc recogn that for some drug adult studi may be applic to pediatr patient under the age of 16 year who have pass puberti inde a primari purpos of this rule is to allow pediatr label base on adult studi when appropri although in mani case addit pharmacokinet and safeti data may be need to support pediatr use statement in other case particular for pediatr patient in the 12 to 16 year age group there may be less addit data need b applic of the rule to biolog drug product 2 one comment said that it was unclear whether the rule appli to biolog drug product the rule as well as 201 57 in general appli to biolog drug product c pediatr studi 3 one comment note that about 80 percent of drug label current contain languag exclud use of the drug in pediatr patient or limit use onli to specif age group the comment ask fda to encourag sponsor to includ pediatr patient in their clinic studi when the drug is like to be effect for an indic in this popul as state in the preambl to the propos rule fda encourag sponsor to includ pediatr patient in their clinic studi and analyz investig new drug applic and new drug applic ndas to determin whether studi in this popul should be done befor the drug is approv 57 fr 47423 at 47424 under certain circumst the agenc may requir that clinic studi in the pediatr popul be conduct befor market approv see respons to comment number 4 in section iii c of this document if a drug is like to be effect for pediatr use the agenc is make it clear that label for pediatr use may sometim be base on adequ and well control studi in adult with addit pediatr data fda intend that this rule will call further attent to the need for creat and review data on pediatr use 4 one comment ask whether fda intend to requir a sponsor to submit inform for a specif pediatr indic or use if there are avail data suggest that such an indic or use would be permit under the regul the comment said that there may be good reason whi a sponsor might not wish to seek a pediatr indic or use for a drug even when avail evid would support such a use for exampl the drug benefit risk ratio in the pediatr popul might be differ from that in adult or there might be suffici and better altern therapi avail for the pediatr use addit the comment express concern that a drug that has been test in adult may not provid a suffici legal defens against a claim for injuri of a child the comment said that a sponsor should not be forc to assum or be place in the posit of have to defend such an action unless the sponsor believ the data in support of the pediatr use are suffici and that a sponsor should not be mandat or forc by the rule to seek a pediatr use if the sponsor for whatev reason doe not wish to do so anoth comment express concern that fda might delay approv of product that have good exist avail data for safeti and efficaci in adult while accept pediatr inform is develop this rule doe not add a new requir that sponsor carri out new pediatr studi nor doe it requir that sponsor submit label with claim that are inadequ support new 201 57 f 9 iv provid that a pediatr use statement may be base on

state explicit in a guidelin on the need for data in both gender appli equal to age subgroup includ pediatr and geriatr popul fda may refus to approv an applic that fail to contain suffici inform to determin whether the product can be safe and effect use in popul like to receiv it in addit for an approv drug in certain case eg where the drug is wide use repres a potenti hazard or is therapeut import in pediatr patient fda may requir further studi in pediatr popul and appropri label chang as previous discuss an alreadi approv drug may be consid illeg market if adequ inform on safe and effect use in pediatr patient is not obtain and includ in the label the agenc thus expect sponsor to seek supplement claim for pediatr use that are support by adequ data this doe not impli howev that a sponsor should seek a claim for a pediatr use if the benefit of that use do not outweigh it risk the determin of whether to includ a pediatr use statement must be base on clinic data and other use inform not on a vagu concern about liabil 5 one comment said that although the desir to use potenti relev data in the pediatr use subsect of the label was understand such data should not take the place of adequ and well design control studi in the pediatr popul and that fda ultim may have to requir such studi the comment state that fda should requir manufactur to fund research project regard drug safeti and efficaci includ short term and long term side effect in pediatr patient fda agre that clinic studi regard a drug safeti and effect in pediatr patient are desir and the agenc encourag such studi in appropri case as discuss in comment 4 in section iii c of this document the agenc has the author to requir such studi under certain circumst in some case such studi may be requir prior to approv where pediatr use is import and where the adult and pediatr diseas cannot be consid suffici similar in other case the control trial in adult with pharmacokinet and other data as need may support valid pediatr label 6 one comment state that fda should consid other altern to the rule includ a formal review process that collect and analyz avail safeti and efficaci data on a drug use in the pediatr popul both befor and after market approv which through committe review could recommend further test of the drug after it is market if specif pediatr safeti or efficaci concern are found fda believ that the comment has misinterpret the purpos of the rule the rule describ the kind of data and inform that can be includ in label for the pediatr popul in general it is the sponsor respons to collect on a continu basi avail data on safeti and efficaci propos revis label and carri out need studi in some circumst fda has requir pediatr studi prior to approv elicit agreement by drug sponsor at the time of market approv to carri out addit pediatr studi after approv or stimul conduct of pediatr studi after approv when appropri fda make use of it stand advisori committe to help decid whether and when pediatr studi are need 7 one comment state that fda should revis the rule to specifi what data must be provid by manufactur the comment ask what number of pediatr patient would be suffici to determin if there is a differ in age relat respons and how fda will determin that all avail inform about the pediatr use of all avail drug has been includ includ epidemiolog studi fda declin to accept the comment suggest the agenc believ that specifi an exact number of pediatr patient to be studi would be impract due to variat in the pediatr popul and respons to differ drug this is particular true given the various kind of data that can be use under the rule to support pediatr label d drug current under review 8 one comment suggest that drug current under develop or under review by fda should be given special consider to avoid delay in develop and approv associ with implement of the rule fda doe not expect delay in review or approv as a result of this rule fda alreadi examin avail pediatr data under current label regul the princip chang creat by the revis regul is the abil to reli on studi in adult to support pediatr efficaci in some situat e supplement for drug alreadi approv 9 one comment suggest that fda work with manufactur of approv drug to develop a method that allow the manufactur to updat their label in a quick and cost effect manner the comment also said that packag insert do not general reflect current scientif literatur becaus of the problem with current method of updat label the comment said that this had creat situat where prescrib are make decis on treatment modal without the benefit of time inform fda doe not believ that chang in regul are need to allow time updat of label under the current regul applic can propos chang in their approv label fda normal review supplement subject to prior approv in the order receiv effect supplement are rate as prioriti or standard and are subject to perform goal set in connect with the prescript drug user fee act of 1992 10 one comment said that the file and approv of pediatr label supplement from differ sponsor on differ timet could mean that some label for product consid to be substanti similar might be silent with regard to pediatr usag while other might be detail the comment suggest that fda and the american academi of pediatr committe on drug could identifi therapeut class to be relabel first so that fda could review and approv pediatr use label for product from differ compani and coordin implement of label chang for similar agent with respect to effect claim pharmacokinet and safeti data much inform is drug specif and will be review as it is submit therefor the agenc is not adopt the comment suggest the agenc advis howev that in general when a class of drug product is involv fda examin label as it appli to the class f impact on industri 11 one comment claim that the rule place nda holder at a competit disadvantag relat to abbrevi new drug applic anda holder the comment state that the rule would give nda holder the burden and respons for pediatr studi and literatur search but not impos a similar burden and respons on anda holder fda disagre with the comment in part the rule is direct to anyon market a prescript drug and is intend to encourag the inclus of more complet inform about use of a drug in the pediatr popul and about hazard associ with this use the rule permit a new basi for refer to pediatr use but it doe not impos a new requir to conduct studi in pediatr popul to the extent that nda holder have access to data not avail to anda holder they will have more data to examin and more likelihood of have a basi for propos chang to the pediatr use subsect of label the agenc believ this repres onli a modest burden and in ani event see no other way to gain further pediatr inform in label anda holder cannot be requir to examin data they do not possess anda holder are not preclud from provid pediatr use data and are expect to do so under this rule if data are avail an anda applic who believ new safeti or effect inform should be ad to a product label should provid adequ support inform to fda and fda will determin whether the label for the generic and

to pediatr patient without a physician instruct the comment said that requir over complic and lengthi inform on label would discourag the prescrib of need medic fda believ that the comment misinterpret the propos rule and the purpos of pediatr use label the purpos of the rule is to encourag more pediatr use inform in label and to provid practition with more inform on pediatr use 14 one comment said that for certain product eg corticosteroid where class label has been in effect the agenc will have to decid and communic how the pediatr word will be address in most case pediatr label

case the agenc will have conclud that the cours of the diseas and the effect of the drug are suffici similar in children and adult to permit extrapol from the adult data to children the addit inform support pediatr use must includ data on the pharmacokinet of the drug in children for determin of pediatr dosag other inform such as data from pharmacodynam studi of the drug in children control or uncontrol studi confirm the safeti or effect of the drug in children pertin premarket or postmarket studi or experi may be necessari to establish the applic of the adult data to children 15 one comment said fda should revis propos 201 57 f 9 iii to indic that pharmacokinet data are not mandatori in some situat anoth comment state that pharmacokinet data may not be the most appropri way to determin pediatr dose becaus the differ in metabol or in distribut in pediatr patient may support dose that will not necessarili be relat to blood level both comment state that dose for inhal product should not be base on pharmacokinet anoth comment said that difficulti in obtain inform consent use of placebo control and obtain adequ blood sampl for pharmacokinet analysi in pediatr patient are not serious impedi to perform studi necessari for appropri pediatr label the comment said there is a well establish ethic structur within which inform consent may be obtain and placebo control use in the pediatr popul and that current technolog requir onli veri small blood sampl for measur of most compound accord to the comment the primari impedi to do adequ clinic trial in the pediatr popul are the absenc of a regulatori mandat and the exist of econom disincent the agenc recogn that pharmacokinet data are import sourc of inform but may not alway be the most appropri method for determin pediatr dose schedul and may be infeas unnecessari or insuffici other type of data or experi may sometim substitut for pharmacokinet data and other data or experi in the pediatr popul may be need in addit to pharmacokinet data the agenc has modifi the rule to state that the addit inform support pediatr use must ordinarili includ data on the pharmacokinet of the drug in the pediatr popul for determin of pediatr dosag as discuss in respons to comment 4 in section iii c of this document this rule doe not creat a new requir for pediatr studi but the author for requir pediatr studi alreadi exist there are situat in which data on safe and effect use in pediatr patient may be necessari for approv or for continu market of a drug revis 201 57 f 9 doe not creat the requir for pediatr studi but is intend

adult data to pediatr patient but more general to show that the drug can be use safe and effect in pediatr patient section 201 57 f 9 iii has also been modifi to remov ani potenti misimpress that uncontrol studi could demonstr effect 16 one comment question the rule languag about extrapol adult data to pediatr patient the comment said that the exact mechan by which mani psychiatr drug work is not known so that for these drug product extrapol between adult and pediatr popul may be inaccur and potenti hazard the comment note that random control studi of tricycl antidepress in pediatr patient have rais question regard efficaci while safeti issu have been rais base on noncontrol data indic a potenti risk which might not have been clear base on adult data of sudden cardiac death in pediatr patient use tricycl fda agre that extrapol from adult experi is inappropri and thus unaccept in some case extrapol is not necessari under the rule but is an altern to the conduct of adequ and well control studi in pediatr patient in those case where the pediatr use statement is base primarili on adequ and well control studi in adult addit inform support pediatr use is usual need ordinarili includ data on the pharmacokinet of the drug in the pediatr popul for determin of pediatr dosag other inform such as data from pharmacodynam studi of the drug in pediatr patient data from other studi support the safeti or effect of the drug in pediatr patient pertin premarket or postmarket studi or experi may be necessari to show that the drug can be use safe and effect in the pediatr popul 17 one comment said that the preambl to the final regul should clarifi that other inform support pediatr use in propos 201 57 f 9 iii need not be limit to data develop or sponsor by the nda holder but may includ data such as report of studi by academ research in peer review journal that were prepar by person who are not relat to the nda sponsor the agenc believ that no chang is need in revis 201 57 f 9

provis may creat disincent for sponsor to develop better inform on pediatr use of their drug the comment suggest that fda requir mandatori phase in safeti test and appropri clinic studi of pharmaceut in the pediatr popul altern the comment recommend that fda and manufactur work to develop agreement wherebi the manufactur consent to carri out addit postapprov pediatr studi fda believ that the comment suggest action beyond the scope of this rule fda encourag pediatr test and as discuss in comment 4 in section iii c of this document has the author to requir pediatr studi in some case fda will requir pediatr studi for approv or continu market this rule howev doe not add new requir for pediatr studi but rather describ the kind of data that can be use to support label claim f propos 201 57 f 9 vi propos 201 57 f 9 vi renumb as 201 57 f 9 vii provid i f the sponsor believ that none of the statement describ in paragraph f 9 i through f 9 v renumb as f 9 ii through f 9 vi of this section is appropri or relev to the label of a particular drug the sponsor shall provid reason for omiss of the statement and may propos altern statement s fda may permit use of an altern statement 19 one comment assert that the propos did not adequ address the problem of a larg number of drug that have been approv and market for year without pediatr usag inform in their label which are wide use in pediatr patient and for which there is substanti publish literatur regard their pediatr use the comment note that propos 201 57 f 9 vi would impos on the sponsor the respons for provid inform that would promot the safe and effect use of prescript drug in pediatr patient and note that the sponsor may have complex reason for not necessarili want to includ pediatr inform in the label the comment recommend that the final rule includ a mechan that would allow summari inform from authorit publish literatur to be ad to the label of current market drug so this inform would be avail to the pediatr prescrib it suggest that the rule should provid an option permit recogn authorit medic expert or group of expert to provid inform to support pediatr inform in the label in lieu of the sponsor anoth comment urg the agenc to provid for the incorpor of supplement indic into drug label base sole on inform submit by person other than the sponsor the comment said that chang should be made base on studi report in peer review medic literatur rather than reli on submiss by the sponsor the comment state that this was necessari to make the label of certain drug particular anticanc agent conform to the current state of medic knowledg the comment note that fda restrict promot of off label use and third parti payer often take the posit that agent that have no label indic for treatment of cancer in pediatr patient are experiment and therefor nonreimburs even though they may be safe and effect the sponsor is primarili respons for bring forth evid to support label chang a third parti could howev provid evid to persuad the agenc to direct the sponsor to submit a label supplement a studi need not have been conduct by or on behalf of the sponsor in order to support a label chang the evid to support label should continu to be of the type and qualiti that would ordinarili support label statement publish literatur on pediatr use may contribut to this evid and authorit group may suggest approach but the view of authorit group do not themselv repres suffici evid of effect with respect to the comment concern reimburs the agenc advis that reimburs to patient are beyond the scope of the rule and fda author howev fda agre with the under concern that appropri indic be on the label so that practition understand how best to prescrib the drug for the patient medic benefit g propos 201 57 f 9 vii propos 201 57 f 9 vii renumb as 201 57 f 9 viii state i f the drug product contain one or more excipi that present an increas risk of toxic effect to neonat or other pediatr subgroup a special note of this risk general in the contraind warn or precaut section shall be made 20 four comment express concern about this propos requir one comment said that the data relat to the toxic of excipi includ preserv are inconclus make the requir inappropri the comment state that fda should encourag collect and analysi of data to enabl specif determin on the use of excipi and preserv anoth comment ask fda to clarifi whether the propos requir that label contain statement about excipi that present an increas risk of advers effect to the neonat or other pediatr subgroup was intend to reflect publish literatur or to be base on studi design to show whether an increas risk exist it ad that it was not clear how or by whom a determin of increas risk would be establish the comment suggest that the final rule state that a sponsor can reli on exist inform and is not requir to conduct addit studi the comment also suggest that if addit studi were necessari anim data be use rather than requir clinic studi in neonat it suggest that a standard list could be develop joint by industri and fda a third comment suggest that a requir that ani label identifi ani increas risk of toxic effect to neonat or other pediatr group should not be interpret as establish a requir that sponsor conduct toxicolog or other studi to identifi or quantifi such risk the comment also state that the preambl to the final regul should state whether the increas risk of toxic effect is limit to those establish by human data or experi or would also includ those base on anim or in vitro model a fourth comment note that anda holder may use excipi differ from those use by the refer list drug the comment suggest that anda holder should be requir to provid specif inform regard excipi use the final rule requir the label for a drug product contain one or more inact ingredi that present an increas risk of toxic effect to neonat or other pediatr subgroup to note such risk in the contraind warn or precaut section of the label if toxic data for the inact ingredi s do not exist or are inconclus revis 201 57 f 9 viii would not requir the label to contain a statement about an increas risk to neonat or other pediatr subgroup howev in such case fda encourag applic to collect and analyz data on inact ingredi and preserv that could repres a pediatr risk these data may includ human data anim data or data deriv from in vitro model fda also note that current regul alreadi requir anda applic whose inact ingredi differ from those use in the refer list drug to identifi and character the inact ingredi in a propos drug product and to provid inform demonstr that such inact ingredi do not affect the safeti of the propos drug product see 21 cfr 314 94 a 9 given these provis there is no reason to believ that the inact ingredi use in a generic drug product are ani less safe than those in the refer list drug the agenc has determin that for the purpos of this final rule the term excipi and inact ingredi have the same mean howev becaus the agenc general use the term inact ingredi the agenc has on it own initi amend propos 201 57 f 9 vii to refer to inact ingredi instead of excipi v legal author fdas

industri produc a wide varieti and larger quantiti of industri good for the countrysid to fill the rural shop with high qualiti household utensil and articl for cultur use as well as daili necess so that the rural popul can buy at ani time whatev good they need in addit it is import to fix the price of industri product suppli to the countrysid and the purchas price of agricultur product reason in our countri the state uniform fix the price of industri product and the purchas price of agricultur product and these price serv as an import econom lever that ensur the product and commerci tie between town and countrysid in a plan way and urban support for the countrysid we must proper fix and appli the price of industri product and the purchas price of agricultur product on the principl of strengthen industri assist to agricultur and urban support for the countrysid to ensur a balanc develop of industri and agricultur and an equit improv of the live standard of worker and farmer we must

the basi of industri develop and take posit state and social measur to provid the farmer as well as the worker with better work and live condit in order to elimin the distinct between town and countrysid and final solv the rural question we must on the strength of the success in the ideolog technic and cultur revolut elimin the distinct in the standard of econom manag between industri and agricultur and turn cooper properti in the countrysid gradual into all peopl properti the basic method of elimin the distinct in the standard of econom manag between industri and agricultur is to bring the manag method of the agricultur cooper economi close to the advanc enterpris manag method of industri as indic by the rural these after the cooperativ of agricultur in the countrysid our parti establish the chuch orient system of agricultur guidanc centr on the counti cooper farm manag committe and ever sinc it has steadili improv it guidanc and manag of the socialist rural economi the realiti of our rural communiti clear show that the system of agricultur guidanc establish by our parti is the most effect way of give industri guidanc and the state materi and technic assist to the cooper rural economi we must build up the counti cooper farm manag committe and other agricultur guidanc organ in keep with the requir of the develop situat and enhanc their function and role to improv the guidanc and manag of the rural economi now that the materi and technic foundat of the rural economi have been consolid incompar and the level of industri and modern of agricultur is rise everi day we must improv technic guidanc to agricultur product decis the technic guidanc of agricultur product is the main task of the counti cooper farm manag committe which give direct guidanc to the product and manag activ of cooper farm in the field the manag committe must establish a well organ system of technic guidanc give scientif and technic guidanc to all the process of agricultur product as requir by the chuch farm method and ensur that the cooper farm make effect use of the modern farm machin and farm materi the manag committe must also build up the state enterpris that serv the rural cooper economi and manag them skil so that they play a greater role in the agricultur product of cooper farm and realiz the state materi and technic assist effect in the guidanc and manag of the rural economi it is necessari to rais the level of plan and ensur the econom effect of product the state plan institut and the agricultur guidanc organ must draw up a dynam and feasibl agricultur product plan and assess it implement substanti so that the agricultur worker display a high sens of respons and great enthusiasm for carri out the plan they must work out an accur well coordin plan of materi suppli and technic assist for the rural economi and suppli all the farm equip and materi punctual as plan the agricultur sector must make strenuous effort to save manpow to the maximum make ration use of the farm equip and materi and increas the econom effect of product the manag of cooper farm must be improv the cooper farm must organ farm work ration to suit the natur and geograph condit and their specif farm situat and coordin correct the farm process the organ of labour and the util of the equip and materi in a comprehens manner so that all the farm oper are carri out qualit in the right season the cooper farm must manag manpow equip materi and fund effici and observ the principl of democraci strict in their manag cooper farm must organ workteam and sub workteam in a ration way and run them effici they should also appli the workteam premium system and sub workteam manag system proper a sub workteam is a cell of communal labour and collect life the sub workteam manag system is an excel mode of product organ and manag method which ensur that the farmer take a sincer part in product and manag as master with affect for the communal economi the superior of the system should be given full rein so as to improv the cooper farm product and manag steadili and cultiv the sens of collectiv among the farmer cooper ownership should be switch over to all peopl ownership with success by consolid and develop the agricultur cooper economi the switchov is a histor event of complet transform the farmer socio econom relationship this is a great social chang nevertheless unlik the switchov of privat ownership to socialist ownership this is a develop of the lower stage of cooper ownership to the higher stage of all peopl ownership in the framework of the same socialist ownership this work must to all intent and purpos be carri out gradual in keep with the matur of all the condit and possibl the fundament prerequisit for the switchov is to rais the level of ideolog conscious of the cooper farmer and consolid the materi and technic foundat of the cooper economi a vigor drive should be launch in socialist rural construct to captur the ideolog and materi fortress and thus train the cooper farmer into revolutionari and assimil them to the work class and put the rural economi on a high industri and modern foot onli on this basi can cooper ownership be elev to all peopl ownership if cooper properti is made the properti of the entir peopl too hastili without suffici ideolog materi and technic prepar it will give rise to an unhealthi tendenc to eat the bread of idl in the countrysid decreas agricultur product and caus a great hindranc to the overal construct of social we have been creat favour condit for switch cooper ownership over to all peopl ownership in the futur by carri out the ideolog technic and cultur revolut in the countrysid while close combin the two form of ownership and steadili improv the lead role of all peopl ownership in conform with the basic principl of solv the socialist rural question the principl elucid in the rural these we must consolid and develop the success alreadi achiev in socialist rural construct and effici perform the task of switch cooper ownership over to all peopl ownership without ani deviat cooper farm should be convert into all peopl properti with the counti as a unit in our countri the counti is the base for link the town with the countrysid in all sphere of polit the economi and cultur and serv as the basic unit for the direct guidanc and manag of the rural economi a counti has the farm machin station farm implement factori irrig administr offic and other state enterpris which serv the rural economi and equip and farm materi are suppli to cooper farm with the counti as a unit therefor cooper ownership must be transform into all peopl ownership with the counti as a unit even after cooper farm are convert into the state farm of all peopl ownership the rural economi must be develop on a counti basi the form and method of convert cooper properti into all peopl properti too must accord with the socialist rural econom system of our countri and the specif situat in our rural communiti sinc a well organ agricultur guidanc and manag system has been establish with the counti as a unit in our countri the most reason form and method is to convert cooper farm in the counti into state farm under all peopl ownership and let the counti undertak their unifi guidanc and manag this will make it possibl to manag satisfactorili the farm which have come under all peopl ownership use and strengthen further the comprehens guidanc and manag system of the rural economi and the materi and technic mean that serv agricultur which have alreadi been prepar in counti in this case the counti cooper farm manag committe may be chang into a state farm manag committe an agricultur guidanc bodi or into an agricultur complex if the manag committe is transform into an agricultur complex rather than an agricultur guidanc bodi this will enhanc it sens of respons and role in agricultur product and improv it industri direct of the farm when the counti cooper farm manag committe is transform into an agricultur complex the state enterpris that serv agricultur and state farm will come under it jurisdict and both the complex and the enterpris and farm under it must oper by the self balanc system and they all will becom involv in the dual self balanc system we have introduc the self balanc system with the counti as a unit in sukchon counti to set an exampl in anticip of the transform of cooper properti into all peopl properti when convert cooper farm into the state farm under all peopl ownership we should somewhat enlarg the size of farm by their reason merger and adjust so as to make effect use of land irrig facil tractor and other product mean in a counti of moder size where the level of manag of the counti cooper farm manag committe and cooper farm is high all the cooper farm and the state enterpris that serv agricultur in that counti may be merg into a state farm with the former cooper farm made it branch farm and the former enterpris it workshop if this is done the cooper farm and agricultur enterpris in the counti will come under a general state farm and may facilit the effect use of manpow land equip and materi the general farm which have been organ as model unit in sonbong and some other counti through the merger of not onli agricultur but also local industri good distribut educ cultur health care and all other local administr and econom function must continu to oper further improv their manag with the develop of the farm of all peopl ownership and with the accumul of experi in the oper of state farm of differ form the number of such general farm may be increas even after cooper ownership is convert into all peopl ownership all state farm should be manag under the self balanc system and the socialist principl of distribut should be thorough implement this is an import requir for manag the state farm of all peopl ownership ration and stimul the farmer product enthusiasm to give full play to the advantag of state farm we must defin correct form and method of transform cooper ownership into all peopl ownership by draw on the advantag of the socialist agricultur system of our style and on the success in the build of the socialist countrysid in such a way as to preserv the exist guidanc and manag system of agricultur without chang it too much and by take each local situat into care consider the work of convert cooper ownership into all peopl ownership should be start on a trial basi in some counti where all condit includ the ideolog level of farmer and the materi and technic foundat of the rural economi have fulli matur and then should be extend to other counti gradual as experi accumul this will enabl us to avoid possibl deviat and loss in the process of transform cooper ownership into all peopl ownership carri out this task smooth and further develop the rural economi without ani turn and twist becaus cooper farm are to be switch over to state farm of all peopl properti on a counti basi the counti will in the futur too play an import role as the base which link town and countrysid and as an all embrac unit of guidanc and manag to the rural economi therefor it is necessari to build up the counti develop local industri further and improv educ cultur health care and public welfar the counti must expand and strengthen the enterpris and the product establish serv the rural economi to speed up the develop of agricultur all the counti must make it their major task to develop agricultur product and improv the live standard of the rural popul and must push forward the construct of socialist countrysid the complet convers of cooper properti into all peopl properti will establish an undivid sway of all peopl properti in our countri we must brilliant fulfil the histor

describ in product label lavi assum that quinin was taken for leg cramp approxim one quarter of the year by each subject by divid the total day of therapi purchas by the total day use per person lavi

not tri to correct for underreport use anoth approach lavi report that quinin has been estim to be the causat agent in approxim 10 percent of all drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia report he note that secondari thrombocytopenia was the princip diagnosi in approxim 4 000 discharg in the 1987 nation hospit discharg survey assum that 10 percent of these thrombocytopenia case were drug induc and 10 percent of drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia case are relat to quinin 40 case could be attribut to quinin assum the popul expos to drug product contain quinin in 1987 was 66 x 106 as calcul

the blood center of southeastern wisconsin over a 10 year period in make this estim it was assum that at least half of all case occur in this popul would have been refer to the laboratori for confirm of diagnosi the agenc note that the estim of the incid of thrombocytopen reaction to drug product contain quinin rang from more than 1 in 1 000 for quinin and quinidin consid togeth to less than 1 in 400 000 this wide rang suggest that a precis estim will be hard to obtain it is difficult to conclud howev that the first estim propos by lavi is correct the number of event use by lavi is the number report to fda in 1987 while no one know the extent of underreport it is believ to be veri substanti for exampl if even a 1 percent rate is assum this would translat use lavi other figur to about 1 in 4 000 peopl the exposur estim could also be consider in error lavi assum the drug was use for one quarter of the year by each person if in fact it was use for one half of the year the number of expos peopl would be half that propos and the rate of drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia would be doubl that calcul the incid calcul base on the nation hospit discharg survey ref 1 employ the estim of popul discuss abov and assum 1 percent of the diagnos of secondari thrombocytopenia were attribut to quinin there is no way to know the accuraci of this estim if it were higher even by a factor of 5 the estim rate would be abov 1 in 10 000 a substanti rate probabl the most credibl of lavi estim is the puget sound base estim ref 2 becaus it is base on hospit diagnos and well document exposur the estim of the incid of qiitp base on the number of document case occur in the popul serv by the blood center of southeastern wisconsin over a 10 year period ref 3 also is base on relat few assumpt and appear reliabl the onli assumpt in this calcul was that twice as mani event occur as were report to the laboratori the estim from these two sourc 1 848 puget sound and 1 3 300 southeastern wisconsin are similar to the estim of 1 1 000 cite by mitchel ref 4 these three sourc provid a reason small rang for the incid of qiitp that can be expect about 1 1 000 to 1 3 000 therefor while the agenc

treat the unblind baselin and washout period as if they were treatment period this type of analysi is incorrect for a crossov trial the relev comparison that should be made are between the treatment

appli to the data howev signific differ are seen in pretreat sever befor the second period analysi of the second period is thus compromis therefor analysi should be limit to the first treatment period week 3 and 4 this comparison doe not show a signific advantag for quinin sulfat over placebo for ani of the effect variabl anoth clinic studi ref 4 use the same studi design as the studi discuss abov except that the dose of quinin sulfat was 260 mg night not the 325 mg night use in the first studi in addit five efficaci variabl were analyz frequenc sever and durat of leg cramp and induct and

observ period two treatment period plus two washout period with the initi baselin valu as a covari the conclus of the analysi was that the treatment effect was not signific p 106 univari analys of covari compar these four observ period were refer to in the statist report but no p valu for treatment effect were provid although a signific order by treatment interact was report also includ in the statist analys of the studi were comparison of the four observ period separ by sequenc quinin sulfat placebo and placebo quinin sulfat which includ baselin adjust mean and comparison between period use duncan multipl rang test these comparison show that signific differ were demonstr between quinin and placebo onli for the placebo quinin sulfat sequenc group ii and onli for three variabl frequenc of cramp qualiti of sleep and induct of sleep howev the adjust mean for the quinin sulfat placebo sequenc group i favor placebo over quinin sulfat for all five efficaci variabl in addit as for the first studi the appropri statist analysi for this type of studi was not done the hypothesi of equal carryov effect was not test and not reject befor ani of the other statist test for treatment effect were perform the result of this studi are not adequ to support the effect of quinin sulfat for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp the studi by jone and castleden ref 5 also doe not provid adequ evid of quinin sulfat effect for this indic the studi was a doubl blind crossov studi of nine patient with four 2 week period of observ a run in period and a washout period in addit to two treatment period of placebo or quinin sulfat 300 mg day the same five efficaci valu as in the second studi abov were evalu frequenc sever and durat of leg cramp and induct and qualiti of sleep no raw data were includ to substanti ani of the statist claim made by the author nor was a protocol includ in the articl of the five primari efficaci variabl onli sever of cramp was claim to show a signific differ between quinin sulfat and placebo p 025 although an analysi of frequenc of cramp after 2 am was also claim to be signific p 025 there was no indic that the time period after 2 am was identifi in the protocol as defin a primari endpoint thus this is assum to be a post hoc analysi done after review the data in general the isol sever find is not convinc on it face in addit the publish articl did not provid suffici inform to permit an independ analysi of the data for these reason the studi doe not provid evid that quinin sulfat is an effect treatment for nocturn leg muscl cramp three studi ref 1 2 and 6 were submit to support the effect of quinin sulfat and vitamin e individu and in combin for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp the freiburg studi ref 1 was a 5 week doubl blind random crossov studi in 24 subject all subject receiv placebo dure week 1 baselin week 3 and week 5 subject in group i receiv quinin in week 2 and the combin of quinin

sulfat was report but no differ in durat or sever of attack was found between these two activ treatment the report describ an obvious improv in frequenc durat and sever of attack between the placebo period and both activ treatment but no statist evid or analysi to support this conclus was provid moreov the comparison of treatment and placebo did not involv random patient group nor was it blind onli the portion of the studi compar the combin product versus quinin was a random doubl blind trial the studi report did not includ the studi protocol detail of the statist analysi conduct or individu subject data the model describ in the summari of the data analysi did not proper separ carryov effect from treatment effect the studi provid no evid from a control trial that quinin is effect

conclud that quinin sulfat alon and in combin with vitamin e at a daili dose of approxim 260 mg was safe and effect in the short term 1 week treatment of nocturn leg muscl cramp the agenc find that there were a number of flaw in the analysi of this studi first the primari endpoint number of night per week with leg cramp appear to have been arbitrarili chosen after the studi was complet none of the efficaci variabl was declar the primari endpoint in the protocol second the studi was of 2 week durat and there was no provis in the protocol for separ evalu of the data from week 1 and week 2 thus there is no basi for the decis to analyz week 1 and week 2 separ in the absenc of such an analysi declar prospect in the protocol in fact an analysi of both week togeth see below doe not show a signific benefit of quinin third an adjust for multipl comparison should have been includ in the data analysi given seven variabl two activ treatment and at least three time point at which data could be analyz first week second week both week the nomin signific differ between treatment at the end of week one would not be expect to retain statist signific if an adjust for multipl comparison were includ in the analysi even consid the retrospect identifi primari endpoint a correct for three look week 1 week 2 and togeth would at least doubl the nomin p valu even without correct for multipl the result do not support the conclus that quinin sulfat and vitamin e alon or in combin are effect for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp first week 2 result fail to replic the result of week 1 no differ between ani of the treatment group for ani paramet were found at the end of week 2 nor was the investig global assess conduct at the end of the 2 week doubl blind period abl to differenti between treatment second a signific treatment by center interact was found for the report superior of quinin sulfat over placebo in week 1 in reduc the number of night per week with leg cramp the result was driven by two of nine center in one of these center the combin product was indistinguish from placebo and in the other the superior of placebo over the combin near statist signific p 10 thus in the two clinic respons for the favor week 1 result of treatment with quinin there was a failur to replic the result report with quinin sulfat alon vitamin e was ineffect in all paramet measur throughout the studi the four retrospect declar secondari endpoint for which statist signific reduct were report in week 1 in the quinin sulfat group compar to placebo were 1 the number of cramp per night 2 the number of night with sleep difficulti 3 the sever of the cramp and 4 the durat of the cramp although a consist benefit on these endpoint would render a find on the primari endpoint more persuas as with the primari efficaci endpoint none of the differ between activ treatment and placebo persist through to the end of week 2 for the reason discuss abov the post hoc week 1 analysi of these endpoint fail to provid convinc evid to support the efficaci of quinin sulfat for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp two addit analys of the result of the studi were submit ref 8 and 9 the first ref 8 was an analysi of the number of leg cramp per day for each day of the studi this analysi show occasion day in which quinin was superior to placebo but is on the whole not help given an entri cramp rate of one cramp episod per night for at least 3 night per week signific differ in ani endpoint would not be expect on a day by day ie noncumul evalu the second analysi ref 9 was of the total cramp rate mean number of cramp per day over the cours of the entir studi period for both the evalu subset of subject and the intent to treat popul two analys were perform on each group in one analysi onli those subject who complet the studi with at least 14 day of treatment the complet analysi were analyz while the other analysi involv the result from all subject with efficaci observ the endpoint analysi for the quinin sulfat and placebo treatment group in the endpoint analys where less than 14 day of treatment was complet leg cramp for the observ number of day were calcul and the mean was carri forward to 14 day none of the four analys reveal statist signific reduct in the mean number of leg cramp experienc dure 14 day of treatment in the quinin treat subject compar with placebo subject the endpoint analysi for evalu patient approach statist signific for quinin sulfat p 06 but the result of the complet analysi for evalu subject and both intent to treat analys were clear negat the total cramp rate over the entir studi is the most straightforward effect measur it did not show a drug effect on cramp while the favor trend on one analysi could suggest activ the studi was alreadi of veri substanti size and should have been abl to detect a clinic meaning respons this studi therefor doe not provid evid of efficaci of quinin

these featur in mind fda consid all of the approach of which it was awar that might be use to regul dietari supplement the agenc tentat conclud that it should adopt an approach that would subject dietari supplement to the same standard that appli to food in convent food form fda state that it was it tentat view that that approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other furthermor the agenc advis that if it adopt this standard for dietari supplement all food will be regul under the same standard fda point out that under the same procedur that appli with respect to claim for substanc in food in convent food form there is a premarket review that ensur that the safeti of the substanc that is to be the subject of the claim has been establish as well as the scientif valid of the claim a claim link a substanc to a diseas whether on a food in convent food form or on a dietari supplement is intend to increas intak of that substanc thus the agenc said it is import to ensur that a claim encourag such increas intak can be safe implement therefor fda propos to adopt the same procedur for health claim for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form 1 avail of dietari supplement 1 a great mani comment primarili from consum rais object that indic that the comment were misinform about the propos regul or that they simpli did not believ what fda state in the dietari supplement propos mani of the comment express consider anger resent and even fear over the propos a larg number of these comment character the propos as an attack against the dietari supplement industri mani of these comment state that fda is plot to ban all dietari supplement a number of comment explain that the propos regul would limit the number of dietari supplement avail to consum by limit the amount of health inform that could appear on supplement label and thus diminish supplement market the comment maintain that fdas propos polici of requir premarket review of a supplement safeti is contrari to the agenc state intent to preserv supplement avail and consum choic some of the comment maintain that mani manufactur would be put out of busi mani of the comment argu that the nation health would be advers affect and that health care cost would increas without dietari supplement to maintain good health some comment contain testimoni that certain dietari supplement were respons for cure and prevent a varieti of diseas includ cancer howev a few comment point out that assert that fda plan to ban dietari supplement are unfound a number of these comment predict that the vast major of dietari supplement will remain in the marketplac becaus about 80 percent of supplement label are alreadi in complianc with the propos provis there is no basi for virtual all of the concern rais in the comment about the avail of dietari supplement noth in these regul will make them unavail to consum these regul focus onli on ensur that health claim if made on the label or in the label of dietari supplement are scientif valid and understand thus the avail of dietari supplement will not be affect by these regul while it is like that some claim may have to be remov from product label as a result of this final rule the product themselv can continu to be market it is true that prohibit the use of claim that have not been author by fda may have an advers impact on the market of some product howev ani such impact is outweigh by the need to assur consum that the claim that are made in label are scientif valid and that they can reli on such claim in fact the onli product whose market will ultim suffer under these regul will be those whose label has born claim that cannot be support by the avail scientif evid the requir that the agenc be confid that the presenc of a health claim will not result in unsaf intak of the substanc that is the subject of the claim is not inconsist with supplement avail and consum choic if a manufactur doe not choos to make a claim about a substanc noth in these regul will affect the manufactur abil to continu to market supplement that contain that substanc fda believ howev that it has an oblig to ensur that befor it author a claim that encourag consum to increas their consumpt of a substanc it have some assur that increas consumpt of that substanc will not be harm 2 fair and consist treatment of all segment of the food industri 2 mani comment assert that fda has not been evenhand in it approv of health claim for use on dietari supplement and on food in convent food form some of these comment maintain that fdas unfair treatment of dietari supplement is evidenc by the agenc approv of health claim involv cancer and coronari heart diseas for use on fruit veget and grain product but not for use on fortifi food or supplement that provid fiber or antioxid vitamin the comment state that fda should author health claim involv particular nutrient for use on ani food that contain those nutrient includ dietari supplement unless there is signific scientif agreement that the claim is valid onli when the nutrient is consum in a particular form to ensur that such an approach is taken in evalu health claim for use on dietari supplement in the futur a few comment request that fda add the follow provis to the end of 101 14 g 21 cfr 101 14 g a health claim that has been approv for ani substanc that is to be consum at other than decreas dietari level shall be permit on all food includ dietari supplement contain the requisit amount of that substanc unless fda determin that i there is signific scientif agreement as defin in subparagraph c that the consumpt of the substanc in the particular food will not provid the benefit claim or ii the food contain disqualifi amount of anoth substanc a few comment contend that fda also has treat dietari supplement unfair by withhold approv of a health claim concern the role of folic acid in reduc the risk of neural tube defect ntds simpli becaus of it concern that allow the claim on food in convent food form would rais safeti issu becaus of overfortif of the food suppli and the subsequ effect on certain subpopul these comment assert that the proper cours of action for the agenc would have been to allow health claim on dietari supplement but to prohibit their use on food in convent food form until the public health concern associ with such use had been resolv howev a few comment support fdas decis to approv particular health claim for use on fruit veget and fiber contain grain while not author their use on dietari supplement or fortifi food with ad antioxid vitamin or fiber these comment note that there are mani compound in fruit and veget that may be involv in reduc the risk of diseas that may not have been identifi the comment assert that befor allow a dietari supplement to bear a health claim author for use on food in convent food form it is import to establish that the supplement provid the same health protect benefit as the convent food fda disagre with the assert in the comment that it has been unfair with the dietari supplement industri with respect to it approv of specif health claim fda believ that the health claim should be consist with the scientif evid avail to the agenc in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2537 2552 and 2622 fda explain whi it was author health claim pertain to 1 heart diseas and diet low in satur fat and cholesterol and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber 2 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber and 3 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that may contain fiber vitamin a beta caroten and vitamin c the agenc also explain in detail whi it was not author health claim pertain to ani specif nutrient ie heart diseas and dietari fiber cancer and dietari fiber and cancer and antioxid vitamin in the case of the antioxid vitamin fda found that although there was suffici evid to justifi a health claim concern the relationship between diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that may contain fiber vitamin a and vitamin c and a reduc risk of cancer the avail evid did not provid a basi on which to attribut the reduct in risk of diseas to ani individu vitamin or combin of vitamin regardless of whether the vitamin is classifi as an antioxid or not see discuss under section iv 58 fr 2622 at 2633 yet becaus of the use of vitamin a as beta caroten and c and dietari fiber in identifi those fruit and veget that correl with reduc cancer risk fda identifi these nutrient as be characterist of the food associ with a protect effect ani one or a combin of these three nutrient can serv as the identifi marker moreov becaus fruit and veget are also character by an absenc of fat and becaus of the identifi relationship of low fat diet to reduc risk of cancer fda highlight low fat intak as part of the dietari pattern associ with decreas cancer risk becaus the mechan of the protect effect of fruit and veget is not known and becaus it is not possibl to determin which of the nutrient or other compon in fruit and veget is caus the observ effect the health claim author by fda focus on fruit and veget as a class of food and their relationship to cancer risk and not on particular nutrient by requir that all character nutrient be identifi as characterist of dietari pattern rich in fruit and veget without specif attribut reduc cancer risk to a singl nutrient or singl type of nutrient antioxid vitamin fda made the claim consist with the scientif knowledg avail to it at the time it author the claim becaus of the rapid evolv scienc base relat to this topic howev fda has continu to updat it evalu of the scientif evid and the degre of scientif agreement on the relationship between antioxid vitamin and cancer as part of these effort fda initi along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public confer on antioxid vitamin and cancer and cardiovascular diseas that was held on novemb 1 through 3 1993 the transcript of that meet has been submit to the docket as a comment on the antioxid vitamin and cancer rulemak along with other comment receiv in respons to the announc of the confer 58 fr 54595 octob 22 1993 fda is review the result of this confer and other scientif evid that has becom public avail sinc the public of the januari 6 1993 final rule on antioxid vitamin and cancer similar in the case of heart diseas and dietari fiber and of cancer and dietari fiber the agenc found that there was insuffici evid to attribut the reduct in risk specif to dietari fiber or to specif fiber compon the agenc did conclud howev that dietari fiber and solubl fiber along with other nutrient serv as use marker in identifi those food for which the scientif evid show that inclus in a daili diet was associ with reduc risk of cancer and of heart diseas 58 fr 2552 and 58 fr 2537 for both topic area the agenc also note the inabl of common use analyt methodolog to detect mani of the characterist that vari among dietari fiber and that may be relat to biolog function eg particl size chemic composit water hold capac with regard to heart diseas other compon variabl associ with solubl fiber in food eg lipid compon may also contribut to a cholesterol lower effect fda found that the inabl to detect mani of the differ among fiber fiber compon and other substanc in food that contain dietari fiber includ solubl fiber and the general lack of conclus as to the mechan of action of dietari fiber and fiber compon were limit factor on fdas abil to draw conclus from the avail evid furthermor fda note that food high in dietari fiber are also general low in calori and total fat factor that are associ with reduc risk of cancer fiber rich food are also general low in satur fat and cholesterol substanc that also affect the risk of develop heart diseas thus some or all of the benefit associ with diet high in fiber rich food could be the result of displac of fat and satur fat from the total diet rather than an effect of fiber per se the agenc state that although the specif role of the numer potenti protect substanc or displac of negat substanc eg fat satur fat and cholesterol in such plant food are not yet understood popul with diet rich in these food experi mani health advantag includ lower rate of heart diseas and cancer thus fda did not author the use of a health claim on the associ between ingest of dietari fiber or specif fiber compon and a reduc risk of heart diseas or cancer instead for cancer fda to be consist with the avail scientif evid and prevail scientif agreement focus on fiber contain grain product fruit and veget as product class similar for heart diseas fda focus on fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber particular solubl fiber becaus of the use of dietari fiber or solubl fiber in identifi the type of food whose consumpt is most like to correl with decreas cancer or heart diseas risk these substanc can serv as identifi marker for select use food even in the absenc of adequ evid of a direct effect of fiber fda is awar howev of the rapid evolv natur of the scienc base relat to these topic area fda intend to updat it review of the scienc by initi in the near futur along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public symposium on dietari fiber and heart diseas and cancer with respect to assert concern folic acid fda disagre that it should have allow health claim on dietari supplement while prohibit their use on food in convent food form while fda did not author a health claim for folic acid and ntds in the final rule on heath claim and label statement for folic acid and ntds publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2606 hereinaft refer to as the folic acid final rule the agenc did announc it plan to work expediti to author a claim if appropri the agenc note that the public health servic phs includ fda had recommend ref 7 that all women of childbear age in the unit state should consum 04 milligram mg 400 microgram g of folic acid daili to reduc their risk of have a pregnanc affect with spina bifida or other neural tube defect fda acknowledg that this recommend evidenc that signific scientif agreement exist regard a relationship between folat and ntds but said that there were factor that prevent fda from author a claim the agenc said that the act must be read as a whole and that section 403 r 3 a ii and 409 of the act 21 usc 348 reflect the proposit that the use of a substanc that is the subject of a health claim must be safe the agenc point out that the phs recommend state that there were signific question that persist about the safe use of folic acid in food as state in the folic acid final rule fda expect that the author of a claim would like result in signific increas in consumpt of folic acid by women in their childbear year and by the general popul becaus manufactur would add folic acid to their product in order to claim that these product were use in reduc the risk of birth defect intak of multipl dose of folic acid from supplement and from it increas presenc in the food suppli could rapid result in intak of 3 to 7 mg 3 000 to 7 000 g per day 58 fr 2606 at 2614 such intak repres increas of 10 fold or more abov current intak in the folic acid final rule the agenc review the safeti consider rais by such increas in folic acid intak includ 1 potenti effect in person with poor vitamin b12 status 2 potenti risk for person take medic that interfer with folat metabol 3 potenti risk for pregnant women becaus of uncertainti about effect of high blood level of folic acid on the embryo dure gestat and 4 uncertainti regard possibl interact between folic acid and other nutrient with increas folic acid intak the agenc conclud that it could not author a health claim on folic acid until the question regard the safe use of this nutrient were satisfactorili resolv in the folic acid final rule the agenc describ the effort it was undertak to address and resolv these concern follow public of this document base on it review of the evid it discuss with an advisori committe and it review of the comment that it receiv the agenc tentat conclud that the safeti problem rais by folic acid can be resolv by set a safe upper limit of intak of 1 mg folat per day for all popul group the agenc announc it tentat conclus in a propos to author a health claim on folat and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 octob 14 1993 in companion document fda also propos to amend the food addit regul for folic acid to specifi the food that could be fortifi with folic acid and the level at which they could be fortifi 58 fr 53312 and to amend the standard of ident for specif cereal grain product to permit the addit of folic acid 58 fr 53305 thus base on this review of the agenc action it is clear that the nondiscriminatori provis suggest in the comment is not necessari when fda has conclud that a substanc has a relationship to a diseas fda has act to author a claim see final rule on calcium and osteoporosi 58 fr 2665 and the propos rule on folic acid and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 in the case of antioxid vitamin and cancer dietari fiber and heart diseas and dietari fiber and cancer the evid did not establish that the name substanc had an effect on the name diseas the evid show that these nutrient were mere marker of food that had been shown in studi to affect the risk of the diseas fda has reflect the scientif evid in the claim that it has author and propos to author ani other cours of action would be inconsist with the act becaus it would result in claim that were both not scientif valid and mislead b altern approach in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 fda advis that a varieti of approach had come to fdas attent about how health claim for dietari supplement would best be regul under the 1990 amend these approach came to the agenc attent by various mean includ the comment on the health claim propos that address the most appropri method for regul dietari supplement testimoni befor congress about implement of the 1990 amend as well as the legisl histori of the 1990 amend fda care evalu each of these approach to determin how they compar with the characterist that fda has list abov a number of comment address the agenc tentat conclus about these approach 1 use of advisori committe in the dietari supplement health claim propos see section ii 1 58 fr 33700 at 33704 fda advis that it had tentat decid not to adopt a committe base approach suggest in comment for evalu the valid of health claim on herb this approach known as the botan ingredi review bir would involv the establish of expert panel under the direct of an oversight committe fda would particip as a nonvot member of the expert panel the oversight committe which would be charg with the respons of review all health claim petit pertain to herb or botan compon would reliev fda of all respons for initi review of these petit each expert panel would conduct an evalu of scientif data pertain to the request claim subject the evalu to peer review and prepar a final recommend about the claim the recommend and all support document would then be forward to fda and the agenc would be permit 120 day to approv disapprov or modifi the report under draft regul prepar and submit for fda adopt by one comment on the health claim propos there would be a codifi presumpt in favor of the committe recommend the agenc base it tentat decis about the bir on it belief that the suggest approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author on health claim becaus of this presumpt in the draft regul submit by the comment under this presumpt fda would be oblig to prove that the committe was wrong if the agenc decid not to follow the committe recommend in such circumst fda could be forc to propos to author health claim that it was not satisfi were scientif valid fda note that there is no basi under the act for such a transfer also the agenc note that the creation of such a committe would be financi burdensom and state that it would be inappropri to commit it limit resourc to a committe with as narrow a scope as that suggest by the comment 3 a few comment address this advisori committe issu some comment voic opposit to fdas tentat decis not to establish a bir these comment disput the agenc assert that the establish of a bir would involv ani transfer of author note that fda would retain full and final discret in approv health claim the comment also disput fdas find that the creation of a bir would be burdensom and cost in light of the agenc limit resourc the comment state that such a find is inconsist with fdas current use of advisori committe for veri narrow subject matter such as over the counter otc antiplaqu product circulatori system medic devic and drug abus the comment state that the use of a bir to help screen petit from the much larger herbal product industri would be an effici econom and scientif credibl way to ration fdas scarc resourc and would also help fda meet statutorili impos deadlin for action on petit that it might not otherwis be abl to meet the comment also assert that the agenc statement that it has the ultim respons to determin whether the petit for health claim is valid impli a mistrust of the integr of the bir process and the involv scientist and reveal an agenc belief that it is the onli author compet to judg the scientif valid of health claim for herbal dietari supplement the comment disagre with such a conclus and argu that health claim petit will onli receiv adequ and full consider from the scientif communiti best qualifi to determin whether they meet the signific scientif agreement standard set by congress through the creation of a bir which would repres the most compet and knowledg bodi in a field that remain larg esoter to fda one of these comment suggest that appropri select for herbal expert panel might includ experienc herbal practition who are familiar with potenti advers reaction to herb as well as medic practition in foreign countri where herb safeti has been studi by govern and industri panel the comment state that the inclus of foreign medic practition would be especi appropri dure the evalu of a claim whose merit are agre upon throughout the world but are not general recogn in the unit state such as in the case of use peppermint tea for it sooth or carmin effect on the digest tract howev one comment support the agenc tentat decis not to adopt the bir process the comment state that fda could well be legal liabl for decis made by the bir that were later shown to have place the public health at risk sever comment call for fda to establish an advisori committe for health claim for dietari supplement where the committe would select expert panel respons for the evalu of propos health claim for all dietari supplement the comment suggest that the expert panel should be compos of scientist and health care profession with expertis on a given nutrient diseas relationship as well as nonvot industri and consum repres these comment contend that one reason for the agenc slow in approv a health claim for folic acid has been it relianc on advisori panel that were not suffici familiar with the research in the area and who had to be educ about the strength of the evid befor they could act some of these comment suggest that fda could retain the author to reject the recommend of the committe as long as it publish it reason for do so anoth comment state that both the dietari supplement industri and fda have been slow to recogn and util a great deal of research that has been done in the area of nutrit and health the comment attribut this slow to a gap between the scientif communiti fda and the dietari supplement industri the comment suggest that in order to close this gap fda should form a committe of it lead scientist to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month or as requir to discuss the latest research in the area of nutrit and health publish in high accredit scientif journal so that the research could be use to creat and support health claim petit the comment suggest that when the agenc committe and the industri reach an agreement on the data fda could author the use of a health claim on the nutrient diseas relationship on which there is agreement fda recogn that advisori committe may make valuabl contribut in assist the agenc to evalu scientif evid about health claim in certain circumst for exampl the folic acid subcommitte of the food advisori committe provid valuabl recommend in support of fda propos to author a health claim for folic acid and propos to fortifi cereal grain product the agenc intend to continu it use of advisori committe wherev the need aris fda believ howev that it should retain the right to decid when the use of an advisori committe is necessari there may frequent be circumst in which evid establish that use of advisori committe is not necessari becaus the evid show that the claim is clear support or clear not support in addit if the agenc were to establish a stand advisori committe for health claim fda would want it to have a broader focus than just dietari supplement fdas view is that claim should focus on the substanc and not the food in which it is found becaus the primari issu is whether the substanc diseas relationship has been establish thus if fda were to establish a stand advisori committe it would be on health claim in general although a number of comment assert that fda lack knowledg of herbal product the agenc believ that it personnel are fulli compet to evalu proper substanti petit concern health claim in this area also if the agenc were to decid to establish an advisori committe it would take step to ensur that the membership of the committe had the necessari expertis includ pertin expertis on herbal product there is an implic in some of the comment that the evalu of the scientif evid support a claim is somehow differ depend on the substanc involv in fact whether a claim is for a vitamin miner herb or other similar nutrit substanc includ fat satur fat and cholesterol the skill need for evalu of a claim are basic the same these skill are found in epidemiologist nutritionist biostatistician clinician and expert in the diseas be address as well as in peopl awar of how the substanc is or should be consum thus fda doe not agre with the implic in these comment fda is interest in have communic with the dietari supplement industri howev the agenc doe not believ that it would be appropri for the communic to take the form of the suggest stand committe to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month while fda believ that regular communic with the dietari supplement industri is like to be use the process by which health claim are author must be a more open and public process than that suggest by the comment certain the 1990 amend envis a public process for claim for substanc in food in convent food form as reflect in section 403 r 4 of the act fda has been present with no convinc reason whi a similar process should not appli to claim for substanc in dietari supplement furthermor fda continu to believ that the bir advisori committe approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author for health claim even though comment on the health claim propos and the dietari supplement health claim propos have made argument to the contrari the suggest regul for health claim that was submit to fda on may 10 1991 and refer to by the agenc in the propos that it has issu state in part b if the committe determin that a propos health claim is appropri for a particular herb or botan either as propos or as modifi by the committe it shall forward it recommend s to fda togeth with all the data and other inform befor the committe when it made it decis c if the committe determin that on the basi of the data and other inform befor it the propos health claim is not scientif justifi for the herb or botan it shall so notifi the propos the propos may then direct the committe to forward to fda all the inform befor the committe with respect to the propos togeth with it conclus and the reason therefor d within 120 day of receipt of the inform describ in b and c abov fda shall either accept the recommend reject it or modifi it base upon the agenc independ evalu with analysi and reason for reject or modif of recommend health claim in arriv at it decis fda may consid data or inform other than that befor the committe there shall be a presumpt to be sustain when the record is view as a whole in favor of a committe recommend under either b or c emphasi ad despit assert to the contrari the last sentenc of paragraph d oblig fda to establish that the committe was wrong in order not to follow the committe recommend ultim therefor there would in fact be a signific transfer of author if the suggest provis were to be adopt by fda as fda note in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33704 there is no basi under the act for such a transfer of author fda doe not question that expert on an industri committe or panel on herb and botan could be help the agenc encourag firm to work through such group for this reason fda revis the provis pertain to petit in the health claim final rule to clarifi that the agenc will consid all recommend by such committe and panel see 101 70 b fda recogn that those petit that have undergon an independ scientif review and receiv endors by qualifi expert group will like be well support petit and could be veri persuas to fda further fda is like to place consider weight on the recommend of outsid expert and it decis as to whether a petit should be grant could be influenc signific by these expert although fda encourag firm to work through group of outsid expert the agenc would be concern if such group were heavili weight with medic practition as one of the comment suggest over relianc on such practition to the exclus of scientist repres other relev scientif descript impli that the herb are to be use for medicin purpos fda stress again that health claim are about the relationship of food rather than drug to a diseas or health relat condit 2 establish of an approach base on a more lenient or the same standard fda propos to subject dietari supplement to the same scientif standard and procedur that the statut provid for food in convent food form section 403 r 3 b i of the act the standard codifi in 101 14 c state c valid requir fda will promulg regul author a health claim onli when it determin base on the total of public avail scientif evid includ evid from well design studi conduct in a manner which is consist with general recogn scientif procedur and principl that there is signific scientif agreement among expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu such claim that the claim is support by such evid fda explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that it know of no standard and procedur for dietari supplement that would both be more lenient than the standard and procedur for food in convent food form and yet still have the characterist that fda consid necessari under the 1990 amend and their legisl histori the agenc state that it had tentat conclud that a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act 21 usc 343 a 1 or that allow health claim base on the exist of substanti scientif evid even though signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim doe not exist would be inconsist with congresss desir to ensur that health claim that are made on food includ dietari supplement are scientif valid fda said that it was concern that if it were to allow claim in the marketplac whose valid had not been establish these claim would undercut the credibl of those health claim that are in fact valid the agenc said that if it were to allow such claim consum would be left littl better off and no less confus than they were in 1989 befor the passag of the 1990 amend fda also express it tentat view that the propos approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other 58 fr 33700 at 33706 4 a larg number of comment assert that fda should establish an approach base on a more lenient standard for dietari supplement some of these comment argu that such an approach is direct by congress and cite a statement of senat hatch one of the primari author of the 1990 amend that a more lenient standard for dietari supplement s is envis one comment argu that by provid for the establish of a separ standard for dietari supplement congress had implicit reject the rigid standard of signific scientif agreement adopt for food in convent food form the comment assert that fda was therefor bound by basic tenet of statutori construct to adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement as such an action would give mean to congresss instruct wherea the adopt of the propos standard would in effect render those instruct meaningless the comment note that court have tradit not interpret provis of a statut in way that would render other provis superflu a number of comment state that use the same standard and procedur for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form is counter to the intent of the 1990 amend becaus congress intend to make more rather than less inform about the health benefit of dietari supplement avail to consum the comment assert that health inform about the effect of diet on diseas is particular import to consum of dietari supplement in decid which product to buy sever comment argu that restrict this inform on dietari supplement will deni million of american the inform that they need to improv their health and to help reduc their risk of dead afflict such as heart diseas and cancer the comment assert that such restrict will cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been save through diseas prevent some comment express concern that restrict the use of proper qualifi health claim base on preliminari evid would encourag inform hungri consum to seek inform about the health benefit of various dietari supplement from sourc such as book and the media which may be unreli and which are not regul by fda these comment argu that adopt a polici that result in consum turn to inform that may well be mislead or outright fals is contrari to the educ goal of the 1990 amend one comment stress that fda should assist consum by encourag them to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet lifestyl and other factor comment suggest that fda should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin all possibl for consum misunderstand or all element of risk associ with increas consumpt of dietari supplement a few of these comment advis that a more lenient standard would be appropri for dietari supplement becaus they are be sold to educ consum rather than to the general popul some of these comment disput the argument that consum could be misl by a more lenient standard these comment note that consum continu to reli on health messag on product such as cigarett and condom despit the fact that the messag have chang over the year in respons to new scientif find other comment state that studi have indic that consum are abl to use various advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner sever comment assert that fda should allow the use of preliminari health claim on dietari supplement and food in convent food form becaus it allow their use on drug the comment state that fdas propos revis of the pediatr use subsect of prescript drug label in the feder regist of octob 16 1992 57 fr 47423 would allow prescript drug that had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children to nevertheless be given to children provid that the drug efficaci claim were qualifi by the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish the comment state that becaus these drug had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children their claim would be preliminari at best and misbrand at worst howev mani comment argu against a more lenient standard and procedur for dietari supplement sever comment stress that the adopt of the propos standard and procedur is support by the legisl histori of the 1990 amend and the ds act one of these comment maintain that while the 1990 amend give fda the option of adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the congression record denot a major opinion in favor of fda appli the same standard to supplement that the act provid for convent food a number of comment also warn fda that hold dietari supplement and food in convent food form to differ standard for health claim would lead to consum confus as the health benefit of nutrient deriv from dietari supplement would be allow to be character as superior to the benefit of those same nutrient deriv from food in convent food form some comment assert that the creation of public confus would direct undermin the intent of the 1990 amend to clear up consum confus about health claim inform and would jeopard consum confid in exist health claim food label and the govern particular public health offici anoth comment assert that adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement could also allow some supplement manufactur to make unsubstanti claim and undercut consum belief in the credibl of the entir supplement industri these comment assert that a singl univers standard would best prevent consum confus by ensur that health claim inform is uniform on all food sever comment support the same standard and procedur on the ground that it would ensur that health claim appear on the label of dietari supplement are base on reliabl peer review reproduc evid a number of these comment state that becaus supplement unlik convent food are taken specif for the health benefit associ with them it is especi import that health claim on these product be reliabl becaus more and more consum are use these product in the belief that the product will protect their health the comment said that these consum were respond to the larg amount of recent evid indic that vitamin miner and other nutrient may play a role in reduc the risk of chronic diseas some comment caution fda that the failur to ensur that health claim on dietari supplement are reliabl would leav consum open to fraud a few of these comment point out that mani consum do not have the scientif knowledg to judg the verac of label claim for themselv and presum that fda regul ensur that label claim are proper substanti one of these comment warn that older american are especi vulner to fraud this comment point out that the elder suffer disproport from diet relat diseas read supplement label more often than other peopl are more trust of salesperson and do less research than younger consum other comment warn that unsubstanti health claim can harm consum by induc them to consum product that are inher unsaf to consum excess dose of some substanc or to forego more benefici form of treatment for a given maladi a number of comment insist that the propos regul will not restrict the flow of inform on nutrit and health to consum one of these comment state that rough 80 percent of supplement label are alreadi in complianc with the propos regul other comment note that educ materi are not cover by the propos regul and that there are mani avail channel through which inform can be freeli dissemin other than food label moreov one comment contend that supplement label are neither intend nor current use to educ the public but instead serv to sell the product to which they are attach some comment state that appli the same standard to both convent food and dietari supplement would creat a desir level play field for all food processor and manufactur one comment state the adopt of the propos standard will provid an atmospher in which all food manufactur can move toward the product of healthier food which will benefit the public health in fdas reconsider of how best to regul dietari supplement one of the most signific issu has been the issu of whether supplement should be regul under a more lenient standard or the same scientif standard as that establish by congress for food in convent food form despit assert by some that congress direct that a more lenient standard be establish the legisl histori of the 1990 amend doe not support such a posit to the contrari as other comment point out and as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim propos 56 fr 60537 at 60539 through 60540 the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2507 through 2509 and the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 congress did not intend that the agenc be forc to adopt a differ standard for dietari supplement instead congress gave the agenc the discret to adopt ani appropri scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement there was noth in the comment that indic that fda doe not have this discret inde as some of the comment point out there was consider support in both the hous of repres and the senat for adopt of the same scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement fda address the posit of member of congress on this issu in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33703 senat hatch left no question about his posit that fda should use this flexibl to adopt the standard and procedur for dietari supplement that appear appropri to the agenc to adopt a more lenient standard howev other member of congress were equal clear about their posit that fda should not adopt a more lenient standard in the octob 24 1990 congression record at s 16608 ref 4 senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state it is my view that there is no reason to do anyth other than util the same procedur and standard for dietari supplement whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud further the hous of repres clear did not support a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the statement of hous floor manag that appear in the octob 26 1990 congression record at h 12953 ref 2 state whatev approach the agenc take it must adopt a system that evalu the valid of ani diseas claim made with respect to these substanc it system must be base on consider of public health and consum fraud as in everi similar decis made by the agenc today we fulli expect that the agenc evalu of diseas claim made with respect to vitamin will be base on sound scientif principl there is a great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim the potenti is just as great for vitamin as it is for other product in our view vitamin and other substanc cover by this provis should be subject to at least as strong a standard as is applic to other food that contain claim that the food will treat a diseas or health condit noth in the ds act or it legisl histori indic in ani way that congress chang it posit about it goal of the 1990 amend with respect to prohibit mislead health claim and improv of the public health through use of valid and understand claim in food label ref 3 although congress left no question that the exact standard and procedur for the regul of health claim for dietari supplement is left to the discret of fda and although congress did not provid direct guidanc concern how fda should use this discret congress did provid consider general guidanc about the intent of the health claim provis of the 1990 amend in view of the fact that this guidanc doe not distinguish between dietari supplement and food in convent food form fda consid this guidanc to be applic to both type of food as point out abov in this respons senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state that whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement he stress that the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 4 the quot statement of the hous floor manag also stress that the agenc approach to regul dietari supplement must be base on consider of public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 2 in addit these quot statement make it clear that congress consid the use of inaccur or unsupport health claim on food label to be harm to the public ref 2 moreov mr waxman one of the hous floor manag state the follow in the juli 30 1990 congression record h5844 what we have sought to do is to permit health claim but onli health claim base on scientif valid inform and we hope by have that scientif valid inform upon which a claim can be made that health claim in the futur will be health and not mislead furthermor as the agenc point out in the januari 6 1993 feder regist 58 fr 2478 at 2526 by enact the 1990 amend congress sought to ensur that health claim would be scientif valid and not mislead see for exampl statement of rep madigan and statement of rep waxman ref 2 experi had shown that mani unfound health claim were be use on food statement of rep waxman ref 2 congress recogn the great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim id statement of hous floor manag in respons to the high potenti for health claim to be mislead congress legisl that ani claim that is not consist with fda regul will misbrand a food section 403 r 1 b of the act state that a food is misbrand if it label or label contain a claim that expressli or by implic character the relationship of ani nutrient of the food to a diseas or a health relat condit unless the claim compli with regul promulg by fda 403 r 1 b emphasi ad by take this approach congress chose to permit onli those health claim on food that fda determin to be scientif valid effect recogn that health claim are so potenti mislead as to be inher mislead appli the same standard and procedur to health claim on dietari supplement as that that appli to food in convent food form will not affect the avail of ani dietari supplement will ensur that health claim that appear in label are scientif valid and understand and will subject all segment of the food industri to regul in a fair and consist manner those comment favor the same standard and procedur for reason of fair control of consum fraud and convey of valid inform about diet and it impact on a diseas or health relat condit serv to reinforc fdas conclus that the agenc propos rule should be final as propos the agenc disagre with argument that use of the same approach for dietari supplement as for convent food would deni million of american the dietari inform that they need to improv their health and therebi cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been avoid as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 in the absenc of adequ data to establish that health claim are valid assert about cost associ with the lack of inform in food label and about the benefit of consumpt of substanc in dietari supplement are high specul and high question fda doe not agre that it should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin the possibl of consum misunderstand fda must weigh the public health impact of permit a multitud of preliminari claim against the possibl that a signific portion of those claim will be determin to be not scientif valid the latter result would like produc a percept among mani consum that food label and health claim even those that are valid are not reliabl to the extent that as a result consum do not chang their dietari pattern to reduc their risk of diseas they will be less healthi and there will be more needless death from diseas and more cost to the nation economi rather than less when fda made this statement the phrase adequ data to establish that health claim are valid was intend to express the posit that until the valid requir of 101 14 c are met cost assert about the benefit of substanc consumpt are high specul and high question in general prior to fulfil of this requir there may often be studi with a wide varieti of strength and weak indic that there may or may not be a valid associ between a substanc and a diseas or health relat condit in decid whether or not to author a claim fda must consid that while benefit may accru from the avail of the claim there is a veri real possibl that signific cost may accru if the claim is author prematur a few studi may often be found about a multitud of associ and mani if not most of those associ will ultim be found not to be valid if fda were to permit preliminari claim about such a multitud of associ the agenc believ that ultim what would be lost is the confid of most consum in the valid of all claim that appear in food label fda believ that the cost to consum of such a situat would prove to be greater than the cost of not permit preliminari claim of greater signific howev is that needless death would ultim occur where consum would not chang their dietari pattern to adopt a more health diet the agenc believ that congress in it enact of the scientif standard in section 403 r 3 b i of the act struck what it believ to be an appropri balanc between the cost and benefit of claim on food in general fda is not awar of ani reason to strike a differ balanc for dietari supplement fda would like to assur all affect parti that the agenc will move as expediti as possibl to permit health claim onc the scientif evid is suffici support to conclud that associ between substanc and diseas or health relat condit are valid although some comment assert that claim base on a more lenient standard would not be confus becaus consum of dietari supplement are more knowledg than the general popul fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that there is noth that limit the purchas of dietari supplement to knowledg consum the comment did not submit justif for fda to chang it posit in this regard assert that use of the same scientif standard for dietari supplement as that establish for food in convent food form is counter to the 1990 amend becaus less inform about diet and diseas will be avail to consum are not correct under the 1990 amend author health claim provid consider more inform about the effect of diet on diseas where the effect are recogn as scientif valid than was the case befor the passag of the 1990 amend in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 fda author claim with respect to 7 relationship see 58 fr 2537 2552 2622 2665 2739 2787 and 2820 also in the feder regist of octob 14 1993 58 fr 53254 fda propos to permit health claim concern the relationship between folat and the risk of neural tube birth defect admit other health claim are not permit to appear on food label and label but congress clear intend through enact of section 403 r of the act that onli valid health claim be permit with respect to concern that consum will be forc to seek inform about diet and health from unregul sourc such as book and the media if fda doe not author preliminari claim fda advis that it must implement the provis of the amend as congress chose to enact them the 1990 amend focus onli on food label and label fda cannot ignor it clear respons under the 1990 amend becaus of concern about the unregul sourc of inform that were mention in the comment moreov while such sourc of inform may lead consum to seek out product contain particular substanc fdas action will ensur that the label and label of those product contain onli scientif valid inform that can dispel ani misconcept creat by the unregul sourc with respect to other concern express by these comment the agenc believ that the specif requir element in the health claim that it has author to date demonstr that the agenc is encourag consum to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet and lifestyl for exampl the specif requir in 101 72 c 2 a requir in part that a claim about calcium and osteoporosi make clear that an adequ level of exercis and a health diet are need in addit to adequ calcium consumpt argument that the agenc should allow preliminari claim becaus of fdas implement of the drug provis of the act have no merit assert about fdas propos action pertain to pediatr use for drug label in 57 fr 47423 are clear wrong the agenc propos action with respect to requir the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish pertain onli to drug for which there is no agenc approv for ani pediatr popul to use the drug in point of fact the agenc propos to requir this statement as a further warn that the product should not be use for pediatr popul thus this action provid no support for author preliminari health claim as fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33706 make dietari supplement subject to the same scientif standard and procedur as for convent food doe not render section 403 r 5 d of the act superflu this section requir that the agenc consid what procedur and standard respect the valid of claim are most appropri this is what the agenc has done the fact that the agenc has found that on balanc the standard and procedur establish for food in convent food form are also the most appropri for dietari supplement doe not render the agenc effort invalid or the under provis superflu the agenc was charg with exercis it expertis and discret and that is what it has done 5 a number of comment provid specif suggest about the way in which a more lenient approach could be implement some comment argu that the approach should be suffici lenient to permit market of dietari supplement without ani restrict some of these comment argu that dietari supplement need no stringent requir becaus dietari supplement could be adequ regul under the requir in section 403 a 1 of the act that the label of a food must be truth and not mislead other comment suggest that fda could requir a warn inform the consum that fda had not substanti particular claim appear on a product one comment suggest that substanti claim could be allow to appear within a specif advisori panel of the label while preliminari claim would be allow to appear onli outsid the panel anoth comment suggest that fda adopt a split label approach in which preliminari health claim would be allow but the agenc would have the right to comment upon them on the label one comment suggest that health claim for which there is substanti scientif evid but not yet signific scientif agreement be subject to a certif and notif procedur rather than rulemak proceed under the procedur suggest by the comment claim could be made for dietari supplement so long as 1 the claim expressli disclos the absenc of scientif agreement as to the relationship 2 the manufactur provid fda with a fulli document certif by a panel of at least three qualifi expert that there is substanti scientif evid support the claim and 3 fda doe not disapprov the claim within 90 day of receipt of the certif when addit inform is need the 90 day period could be extend an addit 45 day under this suggest altern fda would have an opportun to particip in the select of the expert panel one comment request that fda onli disallow the use of those health claim on dietari supplement that are not support by ani evid and that it classifi all other health claim into one of five categori and allow for their use on product in conjunct with a code system indic to consum the level of substanti that the claim has achiev the comment suggest that the highest categori be full substanti the second those claim that have a high degre of substanti as judg by non fda expert but that fda find to be not fulli substanti the third claim that have support in the form of doubl blind placebo control studi publish in peer review profession journal the fourth claim that are support by some evid from in vitro studi anim studi or other studi that do not involv human and the fifth those claim support by anecdot evid in support of it call for various approv level the comment state that simpli categor a claim as substanti or unsubstanti doe not accommod the realiti that full substanti of a health claim consist of cumul evid from mani studi the comment maintain that if fda were to place all claim that have not achiev full substanti into the same categori fda would not be provid a mean for the public to distinguish claim that are near substanti from those that are entir fals moreov the comment state that an agenc determin that a claim is or is not support by signific scientif agreement often reflect a polit decis rather than a scientif one the comment said that fda panel compris a veri small percentag of the scientif communiti that other scientist often disagre with the panel find and that there even may be differ opinion within the panel themselv the comment state that given these condit it is blatant dishonest and mislead to the public for fda to make a general declar that a claim is or is not substanti a few similar comment call for fda to devis a multilevel approv scheme for health claim on dietari supplement that would allow statement concern the tradit use of a product to appear on the label and would permit the label of a supplement that contain a substanc that was the subject of a pend health claim petit to indic that the product was under fda review for a health claim but not to indic the natur of the claim the comment state that the adopt of this approach would encourag manufactur of product that qualifi onli for the tradit use or claim pend approv categori to gather perform and submit research inform to fda in order to reach higher approv level one comment suggest that fda allow manufactur to use facsimil of the fda seal in conjunct with the various rate the comment assert that this approach would encourag manufactur to come into complianc with fda regul quick as the seal would becom valuabl market tool for which consum look when purchas supplement and the lack of a seal would becom a market disadvantag for a compani fda has consid these altern standard and procedur suggest by the comment and find that none of them have the characterist that are necessari to achiev the goal envis by congress in pass the 1990 amend previous in this preambl the agenc conclud that congress intend that fda adopt a scientif standard and a procedur that ensur that health claim that appear in label are scientif valid and understand none of the altern standard and procedur offer by the comment meet this object one of congress primari concern in pass the 1990 amend was the widespread use of health claim whose scientif valid had not been establish ref 1 the purpos of the 1990 amend was to bring that situat under control the problem with the altern procedur offer by the comment is that rather than bring the use of claim on dietari supplement under control they would ratifi the state of affair that caus congress to act as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act or that allow health claim base on the tradit use of the supplement or the exist of substanti scientif evid but not signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim would be inconsist with congresss desir to ensur that health claim that are made on dietari supplement or on ani other food are scientif valid fda point out that if such claim were to be permit consum would be face with a multitud of claim some valid and some not valid fda state that it would be unlik that consum could distinguish between valid and invalid claim although comment on the dietari supplement health claim propos assert that consum would not be confus by a multitud of claim the comment did not actual go further in address how consum would react to such a situat in food label more specif the comment did not provid data to resolv the question of whether consum would be abl to understand gradat of scientif reliabl of claim on food label or whether consum would in fact be left as confus as they were befor passag of the 1990 amend while a number of comment did assert that some studi show that consum are abl to use various advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner the studi were not actual submit in the absenc of the studi fda has no basi upon which it can evalu the assert of the relev of the studi to food label in the absenc of evid to the contrari the agenc consid it more like that consum would be consider confus by a multitud of claim with differ degre of reliabl one of the purpos of the 1990 amend was to end such confus see statement of mr waxman 136 congression record h12953 ref 2 therefor fda reject this assert approach such as those involv a split label or the use of an fda seal would also not be consist with the congression desir for scientif valid becaus manufactur would still be abl to market dietari supplement with claim that were not scientif valid even if fda seal were be use to distinguish those claim that fda consid to be valid there would be a question as to whether consum would be abl to ascertain which claim were preliminari and which were not these approach would not restrict the number of health claim that were of question valid about which congress was specif concern ref 1 thus fda has conclud that it would not be appropri to adopt ani of the altern approach suggest by the comment 6 sever comment suggest that fda adopt the reason substanti standard use by the feder trade commiss ftc see ftc polici statement regard advertis substanti program 49 fr 30999 august 2 1984 the comment assert that under this polici fda could allow manufactur to make claim provid that the natur of the scientif find is accur repres the degre of evid is not misrepres and the claim pass a rough cost benefit test the comment argu that this polici would facilit harmon with the ftc regul govern the use of health claim in food advertis would allow consum to have access to truth nonmislead and reliabl label inform and would still allow fda to take action against those dietari supplement bear health claim that are not proper substanti argument that fda should adopt for dietari supplement ftcs approach for regul advertis are not consist with congress expect for health claim while the ftc and fda are work togeth to achiev as much consist in their approach to health claim as their respect statut allow adopt by fda of the ftc advertis substanti approach would not provid fda the confid congress intend concern the scientif valid of the claim specif as explain abov one of congress main purpos in pass the 1990 amend was to ensur that health claim made in food label are scientif valid no such assur of scientif valid is provid under the standard that ftc must employ under that standard there must be some evid to support a claim but it need not rise to the level of establish the claim valid thus the ftc standard is not adequ for health claim in this context it is appropri to reiter fdas respons to comment assert that it was bound to follow case involv ftcs regul of advertis in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2528 although case involv ftc may sometim be relev it is import to note that fundament differ exist between the regulatori scheme administ by the two agenc congress has long recogn the divis of role between the two agenc ftc concentr on the interest of commerc and econom need wherea the object of fda is the health of the peopl ftc regul unfair competit and trade practic includ food advertis see for exampl 15 usc section 45 and 52 in contrast fda is a scientif agenc empow to regul the food label among other thing under section 403 r 3 b i of the act fda may permit health claim on food onli if it has determin that those claim meet the statutori test for scientif valid the law under which ftc oper do not includ a compar statutori standard thus it would not be appropri for fda to follow the case law involv ftc iii the final regul in light of the forego fda is subject dietari supplement to the same standard and procedur that appli to food in convent food form the agenc believ that this approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other thus the agenc is revis 101 14 and 101 70 to includ dietari supplement a definit in the health claim propos fda propos definit for health claim substanc nutrit valu and dietari supplement to serv as tool for clear establish the scope of the type of claim that would be subject to the regul promulg under section 403 r 1 b of the act in addit the agenc propos a definit for disqualifi nutrient level to establish limit on the level at which certain nutrient that are known to increas the risk of a diseas or health relat condit could be present in a food and the food would still be elig to bear a health claim see section 403 r 3 a ii of the act in the health claim final rule the agenc adopt definit for the term health claim substanc nutrit valu and disqualifi nutrient level that it revis in respons either to comment or to the ds act see 101 14 a 1 2 3 and 5 also fda adopt a definit for the term diseas or health relat condit although the term is use in the definit of health claim and the term serv to identifi one of the basic element of a health claim the agenc had not propos a definit for it the agenc ad this definit to clarifi the coverag of the health claim provis see 101 14 a 6 becaus of the ds act the agenc reserv the question as to whether these definit would appli to dietari supplement the agenc also did not includ a definit of dietari supplement in the final rule becaus of the moratorium impos by the ds act in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda propos to adopt the same regulatori scheme for health claim for dietari supplement that it had establish for food in convent food form to effect this tentat decis the agenc propos to revis the definit of substanc to make clear that it cover both food in convent food form and dietari supplement and to establish a definit for dietari supplement fda receiv no comment on the former aspect of the propos therefor the agenc is adopt it as propos howev fda did receiv some comment on it propos definit of dietari supplement 1 dietari supplement fda propos the follow definit for the term dietari supplement propos 101 14 a 4 dietari supplement mean a food not in convent food form that suppli a compon to supplement the diet by increas the total dietari intak of that compon in the past fda has taken a posit that the term dietari supplement appli onli to supplement compos of essenti nutrient howev fda did not propos to limit the definit in 101 14 a in this way becaus section 403 r 5 d of the act includ dietari supplement of herb substanc that general contain few essenti nutrient in addit the legisl histori indic that the term other nutrit substanc could includ a number of substanc that have not been shown to be essenti or nutrient ref 4 7 one comment commend the agenc for propos a definit of dietari supplement that recogn that these food could have compon other than substanc known to be essenti nutrient the comment assert that the propos definit would appropri move supplement out of the food addit categori fda advis that the comment assert that the definit move dietari supplement out of the food addit categori is not correct a dietari supplement as the definit recogn is a compound food that may includ compound that are food addit whether a compon of food is a food addit or not is determin under section 201 s of the act 21 usc 321 s not section 403 r of the act congress specif provid in section 9 of the 1990 amend that these amend shall not be constru to alter the author of the secretari of health and human servic under the feder food drug and cosmet act thus the compon of dietari supplement that are food addit are still fulli subject to the food addit requir under section 409 of the act 8 a few comment request that the propos definit of dietari supplement be modifi to explicit includ all herbal extract one of these comment assert that the definit should includ process or unprocess plant part bark leav flower fruit and stem as well as extract of essenti oil market as tea powder tablet capsul and elixir fda is adopt the definit of dietari supplement as propos this definit is intent broad to cover the rang of substanc that under the legisl histori could be includ in a dietari supplement and could be the subject of a health claim the purpos of the definit of dietari supplement is not to defin the substanc that may be elig to be the subject of a health claim but to defin the form in which they are to be sold to be subject to regul as a dietari supplement under the scheme that fda is adopt and that congress envis see ref 4 statement of senat metzenbaum the determin as to what substanc are appropri the subject of a health claim is made on a case by case basi base on the factor set out in 101 14 b and the evid present to the agenc the agenc disagre with the comment in one respect howev tea are food in convent food form and thus not includ within the definit of dietari supplement 9 one comment assert the definit of dietari supplement should includ food in convent food form that are fortifi with a vitamin or miner to a level of 50 percent or more of the refer daili intak rdi per serv eg mani breakfast cereal fda doe not agre that such food should be includ in the definit of dietari supplement as discuss in the preambl to the dietari supplement propos 58 fr 33700 at 33707 fda has limit this definit to food not in convent food form to reflect the approach taken by congress in the ds act the manag statement for the ds act from the senat and the hous ref 3 clear state that the moratorium on the implement of the 1990 amend appli onli to dietari supplement not in the form of convent food becaus food in convent food form were not cover by the ds act moratorium the health claim regul alreadi appli to them consequ fda believ that it will reduc confus about the impact of these regul if the agenc limit coverag of the term dietari supplement to food not in convent food form of cours food in convent food form that are formul to supplement the dietari intak of nutrient will be free to reflect their characterist in their common or usual name eg vitamin and miner supplement cereal 2 nutrit valu in the health claim final rule fda defin nutrit valu as follow nutrit valu mean a valu in sustain human exist by such process as promot growth replac loss of essenti nutrient or provid energi although fda did not propos ani chang in the definit of nutrit valu in the dietari supplement health claim propos mani comment express concern about the impact of this definit in conjunct with the preliminari requir in 101 14 b 3 i that the substanc that is the subject of a health claim contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 o and that the substanc must retain that attribut when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim preliminari requir are criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim an indepth discuss of all preliminari requir follow in section iii b of this document 10 some comment urg the agenc to broaden it definit of nutrit valu these comment urg the agenc to recogn that the process by which a nutrient promot health maintain proper bodili function and protect the bodi from the develop of chronic diseas or other health relat condit are in and of themselv characterist of nutrit valu the comment note that the basic function of vitamin e for exampl relat to it antioxid properti in prevent cell damag by trap peroxyl free radic and inhibit the oxid of unsatur fatti acid also the comment point out that fiber doe not promot growth replac essenti nutrient or provid energi but that congress specif requir fda to studi the relationship between various diseas and fiber some of the comment ask that the phrase prevent or repair the negat metabol consequ of life process be ad to the list of process that character the nutrit valu of a food to ensur that such compon can be the subject of health claim a few comment assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit howev one comment maintain that the definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement the comment support it posit by agre with fdas statement in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 that the inclus of the phrase such as in the definit ensur that the three referenc process are exampl of how a substanc may confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list the comment that highlight fdas use of the phrase such process as in this definit is correct fda intend the three referenc process to be exampl of how a substanc may confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list of the function that provid such valu as fda explain in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 the definit of nutrit valu is intend to be veri flexibl the agenc incorpor this flexibl in the definit becaus fda recogn that certain substanc can play a major role in reduc the risk of certain chronic diseas and may confer their benefit through a number of process fda believ that the agenc should evalu the nutrit valu claim for a substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim as describ in a health claim petit on a case by case basi this approach will best ensur that the definit retain it intend flexibl and doe not becom an unintent barrier to author for legitim health claim fda doe believ howev that this preambl should provid guidanc concern how the agenc will determin if a claim nutrient diseas relationship deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc in general the agenc will look for evid that the claim effect on diseas is associ with the normal mainten of human exist if the substanc is use to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit the action of the substanc is clear beyond a normal mainten function and the health benefit would therefor not deriv from the substanc nutrit valu such a substanc would be a drug note also that claim about classic nutrient defici diseas are not health claim see 58 fr 2478 at 2481 fda recogn that mani of the benefit mention in the comment may deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc the agenc broad definit of nutrit valu includ assist in the effici function of classic nutrit process and of other metabol process necessari for the normal mainten of human exist dietari fiber for exampl help to assur normal intestin transit time therebi provid nutrit valu by promot effici bowel function vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag with respect to assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit the agenc point out that the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2501 through 2502 fulli address this matter and conclud that a claim that a substanc can be use in the prevent diagnosi cure mitig or treatment of a diseas or symptom is inappropri for a food see section 201 g 1 b of the act and 101 9 k 1 21 usc 101 9 k 1 fda reach this conclus becaus the relationship of a food or a food compon to a diseas is quit differ from that of a drug the comment make these assert did not provid ani basi upon which fda could conclud that the agenc posit in this matter should be differ for dietari supplement than for food in convent food form as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule the surgeon general report on nutrit and health ref 5 point out that apart from classic disord result from dietari defici of essenti nutrient eg pellagra and niacin it has prove difficult to demonstr causal associ between specif dietari factor and chronic or other diseas eg dietari fiber and cancer the report state develop of the major chronic diseas condit coronari heart diseas stroke diabet or cancer is affect by multipl genet environment and behavior factor among which diet is onli one albeit an import compon these other factor interact with diet in way that are not complet understood in addit food themselv are complex they may contain some factor that promot diseas as well as other that are protect the relationship of dietari fat intak to causat of atherosclerot heart diseas is a promin exampl an excess intak of total fat if character by high satur fat is associ with high blood cholesterol level and therefor an increas risk for coronari heart diseas in mani popul a higher proport of mono and polyunsatur fat in relat to satur fat is associ with lower blood cholesterol level and therefor with a reduc risk for coronari heart diseas becaus of these complex definit scientif proof that specif dietari factor are respons for specif chronic diseas condit is difficult and may not be possibl to obtain given avail technolog ref 5 11 sever comment argu that the definit of nutrit valu should includ level of nutrient that are achiev onli through the use of fortifi food or dietari supplement sever of these comment referenc studi recent report in the new england journal of medicin that indic that vitamin e reduc the risk of heart diseas when consum at level that are almost imposs to achiev through a convent diet but that can be easili and safe attain through the use of dietari supplement these comment assert that it would be inappropri for fda to categor the involv nutrient level of vitamin e as therapeut and to refus to consid approv a health claim simpli becaus the claim concern level of a nutrient abov that achiev in a normal daili diet a few of the comment support this assert by note that the mechan by which vitamin e protect against cell damag when consum at normal dietari level is ident to the mechan by which it protect against heart diseas when consum at higher level the comment maintain that in case such as this one the agenc should approv health claim for use strict on dietari supplement provid that the nutrient is safe when consum at the level at which the claim effect is achiev and the supplement is intend to be consum to optim health rather than as a drug the comment support this regulatori approach by note that the health benefit of calcium occur when the nutrient is consum at increas level that can be achiev through the diet or by supplement and state that vitamin e should not be treat differ simpli becaus the benefici level cannot be reach without the use of dietari supplement similar comment argu that fda should at least avoid establish a maximum level of a nutrient that is consid to be characterist of nutrit valu one of these comment note such an approach result in an extrem fuzzi line becaus the maximum level of a nutrient that is achiev in a diet vari wide from one individu to anoth as an exampl the comment point out that a person who eat ten orang or drink a quart of orang juic per day get more vitamin c than is provid by most current market vitamin c supplement a few comment assert that there is much scientif disagr over what level of a nutrient are nutrit with mani scientist contend that level much higher than the us recommend daili allow us rda fall within the definit a few comment request that fda explicit express in it regul a polici that nutrit valu may involv relat high level of a nutrient a few comment maintain that fda should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it has proof to the contrari in support of this posit a number of comment object to the use of niacin effect on blood cholesterol level in the dietari supplement propos as an exampl of an effect that is not nutrit one of these comment question fdas assert that niacin doe not exhibit cholesterol reduc properti when ingest at the level convent associ with it function as a vitamin the comment state that niacin vitamin effect occur below the level of tissu satur and maintain that the excret of niacin when consum at higher level known to be associ with cholesterol lower effect doe not necessarili indic that tissu satur has occur this comment also disagre with the agenc statement that the occurr of liver damag when high level of niacin are consum indic that the effect of niacin at these level is not nutrit in natur the comment argu that it is quit possibl that niacin continu to have nutrit effect at these level but simpli is overload the bodi normal metabol pathway for rid itself of excess level of the nutrient the comment assert that while legitim safeti concern exist in particular case of excess nutrient intak fda should not use this fact to conclud that high level of those nutrient are inher nonnutrit in natur and are instead pharmacolog other comment express the belief that noth in the propos regul would automat exclud high level of nutrient from the definit of nutrit valu and urg the agenc to includ such level in instanc where they would benefit the public health these comment also agre with fdas decis to review on a case by case basi whether the amount of a substanc is appropri as the subject of a health claim one of these comment state that such an approach would help to ensur that health inform about fortifi food and dietari supplement can be convey without trigger the drug regul fda doe not believ that it is necessari for the rule to explicit state that nutrit valu includ relat high level of a nutrient as some comment point out the case by case approach which as state abov is intrins link with the preliminari requir in the provis of 101 14 b 3 i provid the agenc with consider flexibl with respect to high level of substanc in dietari supplement under this approach fda has not as a general rule establish ani maximum level at which a nutrient would ceas to have nutrit valu furthermor the agenc advis that there is no basi for concern that fda would use safeti concern alon to conclud that high level of nutrient are pharmacolog fda will not do so as some of the comment point out petit for claim that requir that high level of substanc be ingest should have no problem demonstr that the substanc has nutrit valu where the mechan by which the substanc affect the risk of diseas at these high level is the same as the mechan by which it function as a nutrient at normal dietari level howev it will still be necessari as the agenc explain in respons to the previous comment for the petit to show that the substanc effect on diseas is associ with the normal function of the human bodi eg the substanc could not be use to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit in it respons to the previous comment the agenc acknowledg that vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag if there are situat where it can be establish that this same antioxid mechan affect the risk of diseas when the vitamin is consum at level signific higher than normal dietari level such level would satisfi the requir in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc retain it food attribut ie it nutrit valu when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim fda doe not agre howev that it should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it has proof to the contrari it would not be practic for the agenc to bear the burden of determin the mechan by which the claim effect is occur for each petit claim thus the agenc find that it is appropri to requir that petition provid the basi for whi it is reason to conclud that the claim effect is nutrit and not pharmacolog howev the agenc doe not necessarili expect absolut proof on this issu fda will evalu petit on this issu on a case by case basi the agenc has consid assert that the dietari supplement propos should not have cite the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin as an exampl of a high dose effect that is not nutrit fda has again conclud that niacin is an appropri exampl becaus there are signific indic that a nutrit mechan is not respons for the cholesterol lower effect that occur with high level of niacin intak when fda state in the dietari supplement propos that level of niacin necessari to produc the cholesterol lower effect are far in excess of the level at which there is tissu satur for niacin vitamin function the agenc was attempt to explain that for niacin function as a vitamin there is a level beyond which addit niacin will not provid addit function result for that vitamin the term tissu satur may impli either this type of situat sometim refer to as function satur or the type of situat refer to in one of the comment wherein the tissu is satur with a concentr of a substanc and more substanc could immedi spill out into the urin fda was not attempt to assert that the tissu itself was actual satur there is no question that addit niacin will be absorb by cell when the vitamin function satur level is reach in addit to the situat with vitamin function satur there are other indic that the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin do not result from the same mechan as that present by it vitamin function vitamin function satur may be achiev through dietari supplement with either of the two form of the vitamin nicotin acid or nicotinamid howev onli nicotin acid provid at high level the cholesterol reduc effect such effect do not appear with high level consumpt of nicotinamid ref 6 if the same mechan were involv with the vitamin function of niacin as with the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin both form of this vitamin should have cholesterol reduc properti 3 health claim in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda did not propos to make ani modif in the definit of health claim in 101 14 a 1 health claim mean ani claim made on the label or in label of a food includ a dietari supplement that expressli or by implic includ third parti refer written statement eg a brand name includ a term such as heart symbol eg a heart symbol or vignett character the relationship of ani substanc to a diseas or health relat condit impli health claim includ those statement symbol vignett or other form of communic that suggest within the context in which they are present that a relationship exist between the presenc or level of ani substanc in the food and a diseas or health relat condit nonetheless fda receiv sever comment on this definit 12 some comment assert that fda should clarifi the type of statement that will be regul as health claim a few of these comment ask whether statement that indic that a product may be use in maintain good health eg substanc x may be benefici to good health or that describ the biochem function of vitamin miner and other nutrient eg vitamin a is necessari for good eyesight protein help build a strong bodi will be consid to be health claim the comment object to fdas failur to provid clear instruct in this regard these comment assert that the agenc allow of case by case interpret of the regul will hinder industri complianc creat enforc problem for the agenc and caus continu antagon between fda and the food industri fda believ that it provid ampl guidanc on what type of statement constitut health claim in the health claim final rule as the agenc explain in the preambl of that rule 58 fr 2478 at 2479 through 2488 the definit establish that a claim must have at least two basic element for it to be regul as a health claim first the claim must be about a substanc as defin in 101 14 a 2 second the claim must character the relationship of that substanc to a diseas or health relat condit as defin in 101 14 a 6 diseas or health relat condit mean damag to an organ part structur or system of the bodi such that it doe not function proper eg cardiovascular diseas or a state of health lead to such dysfunct eg hypertens except that diseas result from essenti nutrient defici eg scurvi pellagra are not includ in this definit claim pertain to such diseas are therebi not subject to 101 14 or 101 70 if a statement has one of these element without the other it would not be a health claim although it may still be subject to regul under other provis of the act eg the requir of section 403 a 1 of the act that a label statement be truth and not mislead thus all of the statement mention by the comment would not be health claim becaus they do not address a diseas or health relat condit as defin under 101 14 a 6 the agenc has provid a lengthi and detail discuss on what type of statement constitut health claim in the health claim final rule at the page cite abov 12 a few comment ask whether fda would remov or prohibit the publish of book contain inform on health claim and argu that such regul would clear be unconstitut other comment address the issu of whether fdas health claim regul for dietari supplement would appli to advertis one of these comment interpret an excerpt from the report of fdas task forc on dietari supplement as an attempt to disallow the use of unapprov health claim in magazin newslett or other media channel unless the inform has been preapprov by fda that excerpt read the task forc consid various issu in it deliber includ how to assur the safeti of dietari supplement how to limit the potenti for fraud ie diseas claim made on label or through other mean eg magazin articl newslett and advertis the comment further assert that this same intent is reflect in the health claim regul propos in novemb 1991 the comment state that this broad base applic of the health claim regul would sever jeopard the report of health and diseas relat inform in almost everi form of media would inhibit the evolut of scientif knowledg would have a signific negat impact on the public health of america and was like unconstitut fda advis that the provis of this regul pertain onli to a product label and label this regul doe noth to censor the content of book magazin or advertis this regul also doe not in ani way regul the avail of book magazin or advertis howev firm sometim choos to use such materi as label for their product and if use as such the materi would be subject to this regul for exampl sometim firm copi an articl from a magazin and display that articl with a product that is offer for sale under such circumst the articl would be a part of the label of that product what is signific to note is that these regul in no way limit what articl may be publish or what book may be print they limit onli the claim that may be made in the label of food product under the act advertis may provid object evid of what the intend use of a particular product is if the advertis reveal that the product is intend to be use as a drug the product may be regul as a drug in addit claim made in advertis may affect the type of nutrit label that is provid see 101 9 j claim made in advertis howev are not subject to section 403 r 1 b of the act thus the agenc find no merit in the concern express by these comment b preliminari requir for a claim in the health claim final rule fda establish sever criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim the criteria provid that the substanc must 1 be associ with a diseas or health relat condit for which the general us popul is at risk altern the relev of the claim may be explain within the context of the daili diet see 101 14 b 1 2 be a food see 101 14 b 2 and b 3 i and 3 be safe and law under applic food safeti provis of the act see 101 14 b 3 ii these criteria reflect not onli the requir of section 403 r of the act but also the fact that fda is charg with ensur that the food suppli is safe and that the food label is not mislead given that agenc evalu of the valid of a health claim will be resourc intens fda decid not to undertak such evalu unless a petit for a health claim demonstr that the preliminari requir are met while fda had propos in novemb of 1991 that these preliminari requir cover substanc in dietari supplement as well as food in convent food form the provis of the ds act preclud the agenc from appli these preliminari requir to substanc in dietari supplement at the time that the rule was final thus the preliminari requir establish in the health claim final rule appli onli to substanc in food in convent food form the dietari supplement health claim propos contain provis to subject the compon of dietari supplement to the same preliminari requir in 101 14 b that appli to ani other substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim this final rule for dietari supplement retain these provis as propos specif refer to dietari supplement in 101 14 b 1 and b 2 is not necessari becaus the requir in these paragraph appli general to ani substanc and fdas revis of the definit of substanc in 101 14 a 2 includ the compon of dietari supplement within the coverag of this term howev fda propos to add a specif refer to dietari supplement to paragraph b 3 i of 101 14 to clarifi that the substanc may be a compon of a food that is in the form of a dietari supplement the onli comment on the issu agre with the agenc propos revis accord as propos fda is includ in the final regul a refer to dietari supplement in the codifi languag of 101 14 b 3 i specif fda is insert the phrase regardless of whether the food is in convent food form or dietari supplement form into 101 14 b 3 i 1 effect on general popul 13 one comment argu that the propos requir that a substanc be associ with a diseas or health relat condit for which the general us popul or a subpopul thereof is at risk or that the claim be explain within the context of the daili diet would prohibit the appear of health claim on herbal dietari supplement howev the comment did not explain how the requir would have this effect and the comment own analysi of how garlic would or would not meet various propos requir indic that garlic would meet this particular requir fda doe not agre that this preliminari requir will present ani signific barrier to the appear of health claim on dietari supplement to the contrari as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2499 fda intend to employ a flexibl approach in interpret this provis the altern aspect of the provis which creat the possibl of claim about the relationship of a substanc to a diseas or health relat condit that affect veri few in the us popul as long as the petit in support of the claim address that fact and the relev of the claim in the context of the total daili diet evid a determin by fda to provid the widest latitud possibl for propos claim to qualifi under this provis 14 one comment request that fda not limit the diseas or health relat condit that may be the subject of a health claim to those for which the entir unit state is at potenti risk the comment assert that health claim should also be allow in case where dietari factor have been conclus shown to affect diseas or health relat condit for which onli a particular subport of the us popul is at risk eg ovarian cancer in women fda advis that the general elig provis of it health claim regul in 101 14 b 1 do not contain the restrict cite by the comment while these provis contain a requir that health claim pertain to diseas or health relat condit affect the general us popul they also provid that health claim may pertain to diseas or health relat condit for which an identifi subgroup of the us popul is at risk thus ovarian cancer in women would clear be an appropri subject of a health claim 2 compon of food within the context of a daili diet the preliminari requir that a substanc that is to be the subject of a health claim must be a food appear in 101 14 b 2 and b 3 i if the substanc is present at decreas dietari level under 101 14 b 2 it must be a nutrient that is requir to be includ in nutrit label eg cholesterol total fat if the substanc is present at other than decreas dietari level under 101 14 b 3 i it 1 must contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani other technic effect list in 170 3 o to the food and 2 must retain that attribut when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim 15 numer comment express concern about the aspect of the preliminari requir of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in view of the agenc definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 a number of these comment character these provis as an attack by the agenc against dietari supplement some comment assert that the propos preliminari requir would prohibit dietari supplement especi those contain herb from bear health claim comment point out that mani herb such as garlic are special process to remov the flavor or odor from the final supplement product a number of comment explain that such supplement would fail to meet this requir becaus their benefici effect on the bodi often are deriv from substanc uniqu to the plant that do not promot growth replac loss of essenti nutrient or provid energi a few comment also note that mani herb contain insignific amount of vitamin miner and other nutrient some comment assert that the adopt of ani preliminari requir that would automat disqualifi herbal dietari supplement from bear health claim would undermin the intent of congress to establish a nondrug review process for health claim involv herb these comment assert that the 1990 amend clear provid that herbal dietari supplement can be the topic of a health claim furthermor a comment assert that the court of appeal held in nutrilab inc v schweiker 713 2d 335 338 7th cir 1983 that some product such as prune juic or coffe may be consum for reason other than tast aroma or nutrit valu one comment assert that all dietari supplement alreadi meet the this preliminari requir the comment note that a substanc to be consum at other than decreas dietari level may also be shown to be a food by contribut ani technic effect list in 170 3 o the comment state that 170 3 o 20 list one of those technic effect as nutrient supplement and broad defin a nutrient supplement as substanc which are necessari for the bodi nutrit and metabol process fda doe not believ that it is over restrict to requir as it doe in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc be a food or a compon of food for it to be the subject of a health claim section 403 of the act which includ the health claim provis state a food shall be deem to be misbrand emphasi ad thus section 403 r of the act describ the circumst in which a food will and will not be misbrand if it bear a health claim it is therefor appropri for the agenc to make it incumb on the propon of a health claim to demonstr that the substanc that is to be the subject of the claim is a food or compon of food fda disagre with the comment interpret of the nutrilab decis as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2499 2500 the nutrilab court adopt a common sens definit of food under section 201 f 1 of the act when the statut defin food as articl use for food it mean that the statutori definit of food includ articl use by peopl in the ordinari way most peopl use food primarili for tast aroma or nutrit valu nutrilab 713 2d at 338 other court have follow suit see unit state v undetermin quantiti of cal ban 3000 776 f supp 249 254 55 ednc 1991 american health product co v hay 574 f supp 1498 1508 09 sdni 1983 affd 744 2d 912 2d cir 1984 by describ tast aroma and nutrit valu as the primari reason for consum food the nutrilab court acknowledg that a food consum for one of these reason might sometim also be consum for an addit purpos 713 2d at 338 give prune juic and coffe as exampl of food that may be consum on occas for reason other than tast aroma or nutrit valu under nutrilab howev a substanc whose use do not includ tast aroma or nutrit valu is not a food in 101 14 b 3 i fda incorpor this common sens definit of food and the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o which reflect the fact that the definit of food in section 201 f 3 of the act includ articl use for compon of food as a preliminari requir to ensur that a substanc that is to be the subject of a health claim is in fact a food this preliminari requir is fundament becaus both the compon of a food that is the subject of a health claim and a compon of a drug have a characteriz relationship to a diseas congress recogn this fact by creat an except from section 201 g 1 b of the act in the definit of drug for food that bear a claim author under section 403 r of the act thus it is crucial to the continu viabil of the act itself that the choic of the test that determin whether a claim that character the relationship of a substanc to a diseas can be made be base on the appropri factor under the act that choic turn in part on whether the substanc is a food therefor fda has reflect in 101 14 b 3 i the judici recogn characterist of a food in this regard interest person should not presum that inclus of the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in 101 14 b 3 i mean that substanc that may be classifi within one or more of the categori of food addit in 170 3 o automat meet this preliminari requir the classif within 170 3 o are of a general natur to reflect the use to which food ingredi are put all of the classif pertain to the effect of the ingredi on food eg by affect the textur of the food rather than on the human bodi onli a substanc that is use for the technic effect in 170 3 o 20 that of a nutrient supplement has the potenti to have a use effect in the bodi becaus of the characterist that caus it to be use in the food the nutrient supplement categori includ substanc which are necessari for the bodi nutrit and metabol process as the comment themselv recogn not everi compon of a dietari supplement has such an effect in view of the agenc broad flexibl definit of nutrit valu fda doe not find ani merit in argument that the provis requir that a substanc be a food should be remov to the contrari fda believ that these provis will benefit the public health by allow the agenc to devot it limit resourc for review of petit to those that are appropri for consider under the health claim provis of the act accord fda consid these provis essenti element under the framework that it has creat in it regul for the regul of health claim and fulli consist with the act fda disagre with the comment character of it action as an attack against dietari supplement fda believ that the combin effect of 101 14 b 3 i the preliminari requir that a substanc be a food and 101 14 a 3 the definit of nutrit valu will not present dietari supplement with ani unreason barrier for agenc evalu of potenti health claim for compon of these product without question these provis do restrict health claim to effect on a diseas or a health relat condit result from the nutrit valu of substanc howev as one comment point out the current definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement one observ that might bear make in this context is that congress has given the agenc a statutori structur with which to deal in relev part that structur divid the world of substanc that have a relationship to diseas into food and drug congress place the health claim provis on the food side of the ledger fda is charg with implement those provis in accord with the act and applic legal preced fda has announc it intent to implement the health claim provis as flexibl as possibl but at some point the agenc simpli cannot be as flexibl as some of the comment have suggest at that point the agenc would start to erod the scheme that the statut has establish for drug the agenc cannot do that if congress intend someth that goe beyond the scheme that fda has establish in these final regul then what is requir is a chang in the law itself 16 mani comment object to the aspect of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc retain it food status ie it nutrit valu when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim almost all concern was direct toward consumpt of substanc at level signific higher than those present in the daili diet some comment urg fda to evalu propos health claim involv relat high level of nutrient on the ground that categor prohibit them would deni american benefici inform rather than educ them on how to alter their diet to achiev optim health other comment state that fdas categor refus to evalu such health claim becaus of the nutrient level involv would direct violat both the proxmir amend and the congression intent behind the 1990 amend these comment note that the 1990 amend provid for the appear of health claim on food and state that subject to certain condit the proxmir amend prohibit against regul a vitamin supplement as a drug sole becaus it exceed the level of potenc which the secretari determin is nutrit ration or use guarante the regul of vitamin as food regardless of the level of nutrient that they suppli the comment also state that congress envis the approv of such health claim as it was awar that dietari supplement substanti in excess of the us rdas were routin be consum by american and it chose to direct that fda conduct a review of antioxid vitamin cancer claim with dietari supplement in mind other comment further assert that fda was attempt to circumv the proxmir amend and creat maximum potenc level for all supplement by establish an upper limit for nutrit valu fda doe not agre that ani conflict with section 411 of the act is present by a requir that to be the subject of a health claim the substanc must be a food that is consum primarili for it tast aroma or nutrit valu there is noth in the health claim final rule or in the regul establish by this document that will affect in ani way the avail of dietari supplement or consum freedom to choos to purchas them rather the regul that fda is establish are intend to ensur that ani health claim that may be made for dietari supplement are scientif valid this is what section 403 r 5 d of the act direct fda to do noth in these regul would necessarili prevent a supplement from bear a health claim when it contain a level of a substanc that exceed the level achiev in the context of the daili diet to the contrari the final rule concern calcium and osteoporosi for exampl which was publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2665 permit a calcium health claim for dietari supplement and requir onli that the supplement label advis consum in appropri circumst that there is no known benefit from consum more than 200 percent of the recommend daili intak for calcium section 411 of the act doe not author health claim for dietari supplement or in ani way affect fdas author under section 403 r 5 d of the act to regul such claim under section 411 a 1 b of the act fda may not classifi a dietari supplement as a drug sole becaus it contain a vitamin or miner at a level that exceed the level of potenc that the agenc determin is nutrit ration or use noth in these propos regul would do so absent a claim fda will not consid a dietari supplement to be a drug becaus it contain vitamin or miner at level abov those normal found in food howev a claim on a product is an indic of the product intend use if a claim reveal that the product is intend for a use other than for it tast aroma or nutrit valu then noth in section 411 of the act would requir that it be treat as a food 17 mani comment address the circumst under which dietari supplement should be consid drug a number of these comment refer to the follow agenc statement in the health claim final rule comment 49 58 fr 2478 at 2501 a product that is intend for medicin effect that is intend for use in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas is a drug and not a food thus there is no basi under the act for fda to permit health claim for herb whose onli known use is for medicin effect health benefit of such herb may appear in the label onli in accord with the drug provis of the act although a few comment agre with this statement mani comment express categor opposit to the classif of ani herb or other dietari supplement as drug while most of these comment did not offer reason in support of their posit one comment express concern that such a polici would be ground for fda to categor ban all such supplement as unapprov new drug sever comment note that mani herb have tradit been use both as food and drug and ask for assur that fda would not automat regul such herb as drug other comment argu that herb should alway be regul as food where they are consum for their nutrit valu some comment stress that intend use as state on it label should be the determin factor in decid whether a supplement should be regul as a food or as a drug as an exampl one of these comment state that a supplement market for a specif therapeut use eg a vitamin c tablet sold to cure cancer is appropri regard as a drug while a supplement sold to be taken over a period of time to reduc the risk of develop a diseas eg a vitamin c tablet sold to be taken daili to reduc the risk of cancer should be regul as a food the comment assert that this approach is consist with fdas determin that a supplement contain larg amount of niacin should be regul as a drug when consum to lower serum cholesterol anoth of these comment emphas that a consum use of a legal label product should not have ani weight in determin whether that product is a drug as an exampl the comment note that fda doe not regul either fiber or water as a drug as long as their label doe not bear drug claim even though consum may use them to facilit bowel movement or to prevent mitig or treat dehydr respect a few comment suggest that fda determin whether a substanc is a food or a drug by it chemic composit the comment assert that while the boundari between drug and supplement is fuzzi at time drug are typic synthet molecul that are of a uniqu and patent natur while dietari supplement consist of natur nonpatent materi anoth comment state that fda should exempt substanc taken to treat a symptom of a diseas from regul as drug as the act defin as drug onli those substanc use in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of the diseas itself earlier in this preambl fda explain that these regul do not affect the avail of dietari supplement again these regul affect onli the food label and food label fda has no intent of ban all dietari supplement of herb or similar substanc as unapprov new drug fda will carri out it respons to regul inappropri claim but the agenc will not attempt to restrict the sale of dietari supplement to consum unless the supplement present safeti concern with respect to the specif word for use in label statement fda advis that statement that a product may be effect in the cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas will make the product a drug howev statement that a product may reduc the risk of develop a diseas or health relat condit may or may not make the product a drug exact how a substanc diseas relationship is to be character is one of the issu that the agenc will address in decid whether to author a health claim and how to ensur that the claim describ the signific of the substanc in affect the diseas or health relat condit fda point out that as a general matter mere use term such as reduc the risk instead of prevent will not automat make a claim a health claim and not a drug claim fda will make a case by case assess base on all relev factor in determin whether a claim is appropri subject to the health claim regim the agenc also agre that the main focus in decid whether a product is subject to regul as a food or a drug is the intent of the vendor and not how consum use the product although how consum understand claim that are made can be use to determin vendor intent fda advis that there is no provis in the act for the agenc to exempt statement about symptom of diseas from caus product to be regul as drug although such statement may not be claim that the product will treat the diseas that caus the symptom the statement clear pertain to the mitig of diseas by address the symptom caus by the diseas section 201 g 1 b of the act provid in part that articl intend for use in the mitig of diseas are drug similar there is no provis in the act for fda to exempt natur nonpatent materi from the definit of a drug in section 201 g of the act fda advis that it not true that all natur materi are not drug it has been estim that about 25 percent of the drug current prescrib by physician are plant compound and that an addit 25 percent are relat to plant therefor fulli half of the drug common use can be consid plant deriv such common use drug as digitali aspirin quinidin atropin and hundr of other were onc consid herbal thus the agenc find that it cannot reli on the distinct of whether a product is natur or synthet in decid whether it is a food or a drug 3 safeti section 101 14 b 3 ii provid that to justifi a claim for a substanc that is to be consum at other than decreas level the substanc must be a food or a food ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi whose use at the level necessari to justifi a claim has been demonstr by the propon of the claim to fdas satisfact to be safe and law under the applic food safeti provis of the act the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33709 explain this show can be base on 1 a demonstr that the substanc is general recogn as safe gras within the mean of 170 30 2 a list of the substanc as gras in 21 cfr part 182 or as affirm as gras in 21 cfr part 184 3 a food addit regul or 4 a sanction or approv grant by fda or the unit state depart of agricultur prior to septemb 6 1958 if the safeti and law of the substanc is not expressli recogn in an fda regul the burden will rest on the claim propon as a prerequisit to fdas evalu of the health claim to submit all the scientif data and other relev inform requir to demonstr safeti and law in accord with applic petit requir fda will withhold review of the health claim until it is satisfi on these point 18 mani comment object that the propos safeti provis are unreason a few of these comment specif assert that herbal supplement would almost univers fail the propos safeti requir becaus most herb are not gras for use as a dietari supplement are not approv food addit and are not the subject of prior sanction or are the subject of prior sanction that have been waiv furthermor the comment complain that fdas process for act on gras affirm petit is notori slow and extrem cost the comment maintain that the propos safeti requir would discourag manufactur from submit health claim petit for dietari supplement would delay the approv of such petit and could well amount to a total ban on health claim for certain dietari supplement the comment suggest that fda requir safeti determin onli for those substanc with no histori of safe use and provid that the absenc of known safeti problem will be suffici proof of safeti for substanc with a long histori of use other comment urg fda to be flexibl in it determin of safeti for substanc in dietari supplement a number of these comment stress the import of fda recogn that safeti can be determin sole through the histor use of such substanc some of the comment note that mani compon of supplement particular herb have been use for hundr or thousand of year without safeti problem the comment also note that herb are use safe throughout three fourth of the world as a princip mean of medicin the comment declar that regulatori author in great britain germani japan and mani other nation have research various herbal supplement and found them to be safe when consum at the level of use like to be contempl under a health claim petit one comment also note that inform concern accur dosag indic contraind and qualiti control measur are also avail in past edit of the us pharmacopeia and nation formulari these comment urg fda to accept all relev data on the safe use of herbal dietari supplement includ foreign studi and monograph that evid the safeti of these product one comment declar that fda is legal bound to consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state when review the safeti of herb one comment assert that fda should evalu the safeti of vitamin and miner in term of their effect on the normal popul and not on those consum with unusu condit or sensit the comment acknowledg that such consum need clear label ingredi statement as well as educ on food to deal with their problem the comment assert howev that these consum should be held respons for some degre of self protect the comment maintain that this approach is consist with the agenc polici on person with allergi to food compon a few comment assert that the safeti of a dietari supplement should be defin in term of whether or not harm may occur under the condit of use defin by the supplement label rather than in term of an arbitrari cutoff such as the rdi the comment maintain that a systemat review of all compon of dietari supplement is not necessari and suggest that the agenc undertak safeti review on a case by case basi where it believ a potenti safeti concern might exist sever comment assert that fda is not equit in it concern for the safeti of dietari supplement as compar to the safeti of other product regul by the agenc some comment assert that the safeti record of dietari supplement is far better than mani fda approv food addit such as aspartam against which accord to the comment the agenc receiv and ignor thousand of consum complaint annual other comment assert that fdas intens interest in the safeti of product would be better focus on prescript drug which are respons for over 1 2 million death annual as compar to the no or few death attribut to the consumpt of dietari supplement howev sever comment support fdas propos to requir that petition for a health claim for a substanc in a dietari supplement demonstr that the substanc is safe and law the comment agre with the agenc that such a requir is implicit in the act and that the label law in no way diminish fdas respons to ensur the safeti of food fda conclud that the preliminari requir that the safeti of a substanc be demonstr should appli to substanc in dietari supplement in the same manner that it appli to substanc in food in convent food form the amend to the act enact by the 1990 amend cannot be implement independ of the remain portion of the act see section 9 of the 1990 amend the act must be consid as a whole and fdas respons for ensur the safeti of food is explicit provid for in other section of the act see section 201 s 402 a 1 and 2 and 409 of the act as the agenc explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos the fact that the act contain such explicit safeti author is particular signific becaus the agenc will be specif author the health claim that will be made in view of this affirm action fda author of a health claim place the agenc imprimatur on the claim moreov the claim will encourag consumpt of the substanc it would be a violat of the agenc respons under the act to author a health claim about a substanc whether it be in a dietari supplement or in food in convent food form without be satisfi that the use of the substanc is safe certain fda would have almost no assur that it would be protect the public health if it permit as some comment suggest all substanc except those that are actual known to caus safeti problem to be the subject of health claim it would be a great and tragic ironi if substanc that were the subject of health claim becaus of one effect caus injuri becaus of anoth this is the situat that congress sought to avert by includ section 403 r 3 a ii in the act fdas preliminari requir is fulli consist with the principl that underli that section the fact that some herb and other ingredi of dietari supplement have been use for thousand of year doe not necessarili justifi a conclus by fda that their use under all condit is safe but it may first fda need a basi for conclud that such use was in fact without harm effect second fda need a basi for conclud that consumpt of ingredi in a supplement carri a health claim would be in amount compar to those consum safe in the past the propon of claim for such substanc are certain free to demonstr that the use of those substanc is general recogn as safe base on their common use in food prior to 1958 the agenc note howev that the use of mani of these substanc has been primarili as a drug tonic or folk remedi rather than as food see 53 fr 16544 at 16545 may 10 1988 this fact is confirm by some of the comment summar abov as drug the level and frequenc of use of these substanc may have been signific differ than the level and frequenc of use that will result from their use as food although the agenc will consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state fda still need to review data on the ident of the substanc the safeti of the substanc the use of the substanc in food the context of it use and the frequenc of use in the countri where use of the substanc occur see 50 fr 27294 at 27295 juli 2 1985 evid that anoth countri has studi the safeti of an herbal supplement and found it to be safe would certain be relev and should be submit to fda it is import howev that as much of the evid that provid the basi for the countri determin as is possibl be submit to fda although formal recognit of safeti by fda admit can be lengthi and expens such formal recognit is not requir under this preliminari requir in respond to concern rais by comment suggest that fda recogn manufactur privat gras determin the agenc state in the health claim final rule the follow concern 101 14 b 3 ii 58 fr 2478 at 2502 through 2503 fda acknowledg that the gras affirm and food addit list process can be lengthi thus fda design 101 14 b 3 ii to provid flexibl with respect to the type of show of safeti that is necessari to make a substanc elig to be the subject of a health claim gras affirm and food addit list are but two of the procedur by which a substanc may meet this preliminari requir fda intend to consid the basi of manufactur independ gras determin where such determin are submit with petit for health claim and may use it discret to accept without formal affirm the independ determin of gras where fda believ that such action would be appropri as fda point out in the previous comment howev the agenc would not be fulfil it respons under the act if it were to permit a substanc to be the subject of a health claim without satisfi itself that the use of that substanc is safe although fda will consid all manufactur independ gras determin where the basi for such determin are submit with petit for health claim the agenc advis that it will general not be possibl for fda to judg whether gras determin base on complex scientif evid are valid within the short timefram mandat under the 1990 amend for health claim petit instead agenc agreement with an independ determin that a substanc is gras will be most like where the substanc is an ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi that was in common use in food prior to januari 1 1958 in a similar context howev where such agreement occur the agreement doe not constitut gras affirm instead the histori of common use in food coupl with the fact that fda know of no reason to question the safeti of the food ingredi mean that the substanc will be treat as if it is an unlist gras substanc as provid for in 170 30 d and 182 1 a 21 cfr 170 30 d and 182 1 a in the manner provid for in the food ingredi list in 21 cfr part 182 58 fr 2478 at 2503 under this final rule this statement is fulli applic to substanc in dietari supplement the agenc believ that this polici on independ determin that a substanc is gras demonstr that fda will be flexibl in assess conform with the safeti preliminari requir fda disagre with assert that the agenc should evalu the safeti of dietari supplement in term of onli the normal popul it would be unconscion for the agenc to adopt a polici of ignor advers effect some of which could be life threaten of ani food includ dietari supplement on vulner segment of the popul furthermor there is no basi under the act for such a polici fda doe attempt howev to find the most practic solut to assur consum of a safe food suppli for exampl the agenc general doe not base safeti decis on atyp popul subgroup that will use the product where there are subgroup of consum eg consum with certain sensit that could suffer advers effect from consum the product fda may place certain restrict on the use of the product or reli on label solut such as

in an unreason manner by demand too much support evid on substanc diseas relationship befor approv health claim sever comment insist that fda is misinterpret the requir for the scientif standard for

assert that the dispar treatment of food and drug is especi unfair when the enorm differ in safeti factor between dietari supplement and untest prescript drug is consid some of the comment assert that

claim in the preambl to the propos regul some comment maintain that fda should not requir a unanim or near unanim consensus among expert in order to find that there is signific scientif agreement concern a claim a few of the comment point out that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend clear indic that such a level of agreement is not to be requir other comment urg that fda consid the requir for

support this interpret befor the us hous of repres subcommitte on health and the environ other comment maintain that the requir for signific scientif agreement onli requir agreement among a signific number of qualifi expert one of these comment request that fda includ a provis in the regul that the standard of signific scientif agreement is not one of unanim to prevent confus among manufactur and

health claim despit it inclus in the languag of the 1990 amend becaus the mean of the phrase is ambigu the comment suggest that fda should simpli consid the total of public avail scientif evid to

manufactur perform control clinic trial to prove the valid of a claim to the contrari as discuss in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2506 the scientif standard for health claim is less

conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda agre that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend make clear that congress did not intend in call for signific scientif agreement about the support for a claim to requir that such agreement repres a full consensus among scientist the hous report ref 1 state the standard doe not requir that there be a unanim agreement among expert instead there must be a signific agreement among expert but it doe not requir that everi expert in the field approv or agre with the claim the agenc share the comment concern that a requir of consensus would mean that some valid health claim would not be author and by restrict such claim would counter congress intent that health claim support by a signific scientif agreement be made avail to consum the agenc never intend to requir that claim be support by a consensus among scientist and has not done so the agenc is sensit to the comment percept that the scientif standard particular the phrase signific scientif agreement is subject the agenc believ howev that ani standard involv the evalu of scientif evid and opinion deriv from that evid must be somewhat subject fda in propos not to defin signific agreement among expert in the novemb 27 1991 56 fr 60537 at 60548 propos note that each situat may differ with the natur of the claim substanc diseas relationship the agenc believ that in decid whether signific scientif agreement about the valid of a claim exist it is necessari to consid both the extent of agreement and the natur of the disagr on a case by case basi the hous report ref 1 make clear that congress intend the signific scientif agreement standard to be a flexibl one by point out that in review scientif studi fda may give greater weight to the studi that it find more persuas the hous report also clarifi that the overrid consider in assess whether to author a claim should be the secretari level of comfort about the valid of the claim the agenc believ that this clarif provid clear guidanc for the applic of the standard and thus it is not incorpor the chang request by the comment in the codifi languag of the regul fda doe not believ it has in ani way been unfair in it approv of health claim to date earlier in this preambl in respons to comment 2 fda explain whi certain specif health claim were not approv nevertheless the agenc statement in the dietari supplement health claim propos that it had author claim on 7 of the 10 nutrient diseas relationship is correct in the case of 3 of the relationship howev the claim were author for food rather than specif nutrient in these case as explain previous although there was suffici evid to attribut certain diseas risk reduct to the consumpt of certain food and those food are mark by signific level of the nutrient in question there was insuffici evid to attribut ani diseas risk reduct direct to consumpt of the nutrient themselv fda doe not agre that it should defin signific scientif agreement as agreement among a major of scientist familiar with the issu commission kessler statement about signific scientif agreement be 50 or 60 percent agreement were intend to show the contrast between this term and the term consensus not to provid a specif definit of signific scientif agreement there is simpli no bright line that fda can draw in this area ultim the agenc must exercis it scientif judgment arriv at after input from the scientif communiti the agenc doe not agre that signific scientif agreement should be consid to have been achiev when a credibl health author particular an agenc of the us govern recommend the consumpt of a nutrient becaus of it relationship to a diseas or health relat condit while fda recogn the signific of such recommend congress charg fda with the respons

regardless of whether the food are in convent food form or dietari supplement form 26 one comment assert that fda should allow health claim author for use on dietari supplement to also appear on otc drug product that provid high level of a particular nutrient eg calcium osteoporosi claim on calcium carbon antacid tablet fda receiv a comment similar to this one on the health claim propos this comment provid no basi for the agenc to provid a differ respons to this comment than it did in the health claim final rule as explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2500 multipl use product that are both food and drug present a difficult set of compet concern for the agenc such product are like to be both an otc drug and a dietari supplement most otc drug product are develop to address some type of acut medic problem that is expect to be of short durat if the problem persist it is import that the person with the problem know that it may be more sever than he or she otherwis thought and that he or she should seek medic attent label on such product therefor includ instruct to use the product for a limit period of time and if the problem persist to seek medic intervent thus the time limit on use of the product are import to the health of the user dietari supplement on the other hand are develop for inclus in a daili diet at level that are consist with dietari use and may often be consum throughout most of a person lifetim label on dietari supplement contain no instruct for seek medic intervent or for limit the durat of consumpt of the supplement rather under the new regul dietari supplement will be abl to bear nutrient content and health claim which focus the consum attent on the advantag that consum the product will have in help the consum to maintain a healthi diet moreov where the supplement bear a health claim the claim will contain inform about how long term ingest of the supplement may promot health where dietari level and therapeut level differ as is general the case and is in fact the case with antacid and calcium supplement an appar conflict is creat when both food and drug label appear on the same product in the case of the drug label consum are given direct for use that involv high consumpt dure a limit time period in the case of the food label consum are given direct for lower consumpt with no time constraint even though label instruct may identifi those direct for food and drug use in separ locat fda is concern that consum will incorrect assum that the therapeut dosag is appropri for dietari use and that the direct for food use will undercut the warn in the drug label to seek medic care if the condit persist where the label is not proper follow signific advers consequ may result the agenc know of no broad approach that it can use to harmon a nutrient content claim or a health claim with drug label a drug that is label with instruct for use that both limit and do not limit consumpt would be misbrand under section 502 a of the act 21 usc 352 a if it fail to contain a materi fact that is how to reconcil these conflict instruct howev fda doe not believ that it would be appropri to preclud such claim under all circumst such claim may be permiss if a firm can demonstr that dual claim can be made in a manner that will neither misbrand the product nor creat a safeti problem the agenc suggest that anyon desir to make a health claim or a nutrient content claim that compli with section 403 r of the act on a product that is both a food and a drug contact the center for drug evalu and research otc complianc branch hfd 312 fda 7500 standish pl rockvill md 20855 to discuss whether it would be possibl to put such a claim on the product and still compli with the drug provis of the act g petit 27 a number of comment urg fda to streamlin it procedur for approv health claim in order that dietari supplement manufactur may includ the most current reliabl inform on their

obvious oversight in the exist regul ie the establish of a firm deadlin for a propos rule but no firm deadlin for a final rule the comment also contend that paragraph j 5 is necessari to address fdas failur to act prompt to approv claim that are base on the recommend of public health author such as it failur to approv a health claim for folic acid in accord with the recommend of phs agenc fda advis that it failur to specifi in 101 70 j a deadlin for the public of a final rule regard the use of a propos health claim was not an oversight section 403 r 4 a i doe not requir that the agenc adher to ani deadlin for the public of a final rule while fda could establish such a timefram by regul it doe not believ that the adopt of such a requir would be prudent the comment period follow the public of propos rule is a critic step in determin whether a propos regul is appropri for adopt in the instanc of health claim regul signific inform concern the valid of the substanc diseas relationship under the propos health claim may be submit by interest parti dure the comment period also the comment period may bring to light a previous unforeseen potenti for the use of a health claim if adopt without modif to be mislead to consum or to creat serious potenti threat to the public health the agenc has no way to guarante that it will be abl to adequ resolv such problem within the suggest timefram in such instanc if face with a specif timefram fda would be forc to either deni an otherwis valid health claim petit or to approv it without erect the regulatori framework that it believ necessari to ensur that the public health is safeguard therefor fda is not adopt the suggest time limit on the issuanc of a final rule howev the agenc advis that it commit to issu final rule on health claim petit as quick as possibl consist with the issu present and the agenc avail resourc with respect to suggest for shorter timefram for certain petit fda advis that the agenc abil to meet timefram is influenc by mani factor such as work prioriti and avail of personnel fda consid the statutori timefram for assess the valid of health claim and for issu a propos regul to be extrem short given the need to evalu the total of avail scientif evid on a substanc and a diseas or a health relat condit given the agenc limit resourc it would not be practic to shorten these timefram further howev fda point out that although action on petit for most claim will requir virtual all of the time provid by the statutori timefram noth would prohibit the agenc from act in less time than the timefram provid if it is possibl to do so thus it is like that a petit for a claim on a well accept substanc diseas relationship would be review more expediti than one for which scientif agreement is not as clear 28 a few comment urg fda to consid the limit label space avail on mani dietari supplement in develop model health claim the comment state that concis model claim will provid guidanc to manufactur on how to convey health claim in succinct statement that compli with all of fdas requir and will thus help ensur that the health claim present to consum are clear and comprehens fda realiz that there is a limit to the amount of inform that can be present on a food label howev the agenc believ that it must ensur that consum understand that factor other than dietari intak of the nutrient may bear on the substanc diseas relationship given the imper of ensur consum understand of a messag that must be present in a veri limit space the agenc is face with the difficult task of determin what inform is necessari in a claim and what inform is not fda believ that it regul in subpart e of 21 cfr part 101 repres an accept balanc between the consum right to understand the full context of the claim and the manufactur concern over claim length by delin the inform that is mandatori and option in a claim fda is reliev manufactur from have to includ inform that is of tangenti import but ensur that those who wish to make a claim do so in a manner that provid a use and understand messag to consum fda advis that it will take a similar approach when provid model health claim in the futur fda also note that manufactur who are not satisfi with the model claim are free to develop their own version of the claim provid that those version includ all of the inform requir by the author regul 29 sever comment rais the issu of product specif health claim by assert that mani manufactur will be dissuad from undertak the scientif studi and other invest necessari to obtain approv of new health claim petit by the fact that approv health claim will be allow for use on all qualifi product howev a number of comment stress that in a health claim the role of the total diet should be emphas rather than the role of a specif food in risk reduct fda advis that section 403 r 1 b of the act pertain to a claim about the relationship between a nutrient and a diseas or health relat condit rather than about particular food product and such a condit while the agenc has use the term substanc in lieu of the word nutrient and has said that a substanc can be a food in do so the agenc was onli tri to cover circumst such as those present by fruit veget and grain product in which it was not possibl to identifi the specif nutrient in a broad class of food that was have the observ effect on the risk of diseas fda was not therebi includ formul product as possibl subject of health claim such product are formul to includ particular substanc becaus of the nutrit effect of those substanc thus a health claim for such a product would appropri be about the substanc in the formul product and not about the product itself in addit section 403 r 3 b iii of the act direct the agenc to requir that health claim enabl the public to understand the inform in the context of the total daili diet as explain abov fda find that to effect congress intent in pass the 1990 amend the same requir should appli to health claim made on dietari supplement fda believ that a claim that refer specif to the effect on a diseas or health relat condit result from the consumpt of a certain brand name of product would unduli emphas the import of that product and not the import of the total daili diet also such claim could impli that other brand of the same food as well as other food contain the substanc that is the subject of the claim might not have the same effect on the diseas or health relat condit and thus would be mislead under section 403 a of the act accord the agenc find that it is not appropri to approv product specif health claim 30 one comment suggest that fda provid regular month or quarter report concern newli approv health claim petit for display in the supplement section of store the comment maintain that such a list distribut by fda would increas consum confid in the claim when they appear on supplement label although fda recogn that there could be benefit to consum from such

major section of epcra which congress pass in 1986 result in the creation of the toxic releas inventori tri is a public avail data base that provid quantit inform on toxic chemic releas transfer recycl and dispos with the collect of this inform for the first time in 1987 came the abil for the public govern and the regul communiti to understand the magnitud of chemic emiss in the unit state to

tri enabl all interest in environment progress to establish credibl baselin to set realist goal and to measur progress over time in meet those goal the tri system has becom a neutral yardstick by which progress can be measur by all interest parti the origin list of chemic for which report was requir consist of 320 chemic and chemic categori the list was a combin of the maryland chemic inventori report list of toxic or hazard substanc and the new jersey environment hazard substanc list the combin of these two list provid a sound and logic start point for the nation tri program

criteria is given in unit iii of this preambl a discuss of the evid support epa propos to add each of the chemic to epcra section 313 is present in unit iv of this preambl and in the record support this propos rule 4 other consider epa exclud certain chemic and chemic categori from consider for propos list under epcra section 313 in this rulemak for a number of reason some chemic were identifi onli as environment degrad product rather than chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use by a facil these chemic will onli be present in the environ as a result of the releas into the environ of precursor chemic if the degrad product meet the toxic criteria of epcra section 313 the precursor chemic may be consid for list on epcra section 313 the degrad product would not be consid for list on epcra section 313 becaus a facil subject to epcra section 313 is onli requir to file a tri report for a chemic that it manufactur process or otherwis use within the facil boundari therefor epa doe not believ that it is appropri to consid list such chemic at this time some of the list review by epa includ list that repres wast stream from particular process these wast stream such as coke oven emiss are not discret chemic or chemic categori but contain a wide rang of chemic mani of which are current list individu on epcra section 313 the focus of this rulemak is on the addit of specif chemic and chemic categori and as such epa believ that these wast stream are inappropri for list under epcra section 313 at this time epa also exclud chemic whose onli identifi toxic concern was a result of their status as a volatil organ compound voc voc contribut to the format of tropospher ozon which caus a number of health relat and environment problem epa continu to believ that voc meet the list criteria of epcra section 313 howev epa intend to address the issu of how voc should be list on epcra section 313 separ therefor chemic whose onli identifi toxic concern is due to their status as voc were exclud from consider at this time epa also identifi chemic that are routin manufactur process or otherwis use at level far below the report threshold of epcra section 313 these chemic are not expect to ever be manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti at or abov these report threshold in this propos rulemak epa is attempt to add chemic to epcra section 313 that are manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti greater than the epcra section 313 volum threshold and thus would result in the submiss of tri report consequ chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti less than the epcra section 313 volum threshold were exclud from further consider at this time becaus no report would be file under epcra section 313 for such chemic some of the chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use below the epcra section 313 activ threshold particular those chemic that are manufactur in trace amount in wast stream are high toxic at veri low dose level and have physic chemic or biolog properti that make the chemic persist for extend period in the environ and bioaccumul through the food chain persist bioaccumul toxic chemic such as dioxin are of particular concern in ecosystem such as the great lake basin due to the long retent time of the individu lake and the cycl of the chemic from one compon of the ecosystem to anoth epa may reconsid in the futur the issu of list such chemic in a manner which would result in the submiss of tri report epa request comment on the follow is it appropri to list such chemic on epcra section 313 if epa were to add this type of chemic to epcra section 313 what modif to epcra section 313 such as lower the report threshold and modifi the de minimi in mixtur exempt 40 cfr part 372 38 would be requir to insur that releas and transfer inform would be collect iii epcra section 313 statutori criteria epcra section 313 d 2 set out criteria for ad chemic to the list of chemic subject to report under section 313 a for a chemic or categori of chemic to be ad to the epcra section 313 c list of toxic chemic the administr must determin whether in her judgement there is suffici evid to establish ani one of the follow a the chemic is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus signific advers acut human health effect at concentr level that are reason like to exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas b the chemic is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus in human i cancer or teratogen effect or ii serious or irrevers i reproduct dysfunct ii neurolog disord iii herit genet mutat or iv other chronic health effect c the chemic is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus becaus of i it toxic ii it toxic and persist in the environ or iii it toxic and tendenc to bioaccumul in the environ a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgement of the administr to warrant report under this section to remov a chemic from the section 313 c list the administr must determin that there is not suffici evid to establish ani of the criteria describ abov as requir by epcra section 313 d 3 thus the criteria for list or delist a chemic are ident howev wherea epa can add a chemic if onli one of the criteria is met it can onli delet a chemic if none of the criteria are met to ascertain whether there is suffici or insuffici evid to determin that the statutori criteria are met for list a chemic epa conduct a hazard assess on the chemic and determin base on the weight of the evid whether the chemic can reason be anticip to caus ani of the advers effect specifi in epcra section 313 d 2 the hazard analysi is describ abov in unit ii 3 of this preambl epa interpret of the specif statutori criteria follow 1 section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect to determin whether the section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect criterion is met epa must examin the advers effect associ with the chemic the concentr level which would caus acut human health effect and the likelihood of such level exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas such a determin may includ among other factor consider of product process workplac procedur pollut control and the volum and pattern of product use and releas as well as other chemic specif factor epa believ that to make the section 313 d 2 a determin it must demonstr that a chemic can reason be anticip to be releas in quantiti that result in concentr level or within a reason margin of exposur of the concentr level that would be expect to caus acut human health effect beyond the facil site boundari the margin of exposur appli is depend upon the type of hazard data eg data in anim versus human and the confid in this hazard data base for acut effect eg suffici of the hazard data howev epa is not requir to make a facil specif find nor is it necessari for epa to demonstr that these concentr level or effect occur at or near ani particular facil ref 1 furthermor epa may but is not requir to conduct new studi or risk assess or perform site specif analys to establish actual ambient concentr or to document advers effect at ani particular locat ref 1 nor is epa limit to consid concentr level and potenti acut human health effect at the fencelin rather the phrase beyond facil site boundari reflect congress recognit that the highest concentr to which person outsid the site boundari may be expos could occur at ani point outsid the boundari of the site on which the facil is locat includ for exampl where an air emiss plume cool and settl to the ground ref 1 therefor epa believ that to make a find under epcra section 313 d 2 a the agenc may estim concentr at or beyond the facil site boundari through the use of estim releas and model techniqu the term continu or frequent recur releas is includ onli to distinguish routin releas that are a normal consequ of the oper of a facil from the episod and accident releas that are subject to epcra section 304 ref 1 as such epa believ that episod and accident releas are not pertin in a determin that a chemic meet the section 313 d 2 a criterion 2 section 313 d 2 b chronic human health effect in contrast to the section 313 d 2 a criterion section 313 d 2 b doe not requir consider of either the natur and frequenc of releas or concentr level at facil site boundari rather section 313 d 2 b is focus sole on whether the chemic is known or can reason be anticip to caus cancer teratogen or other serious or irrevers chronic human health effect consequ epa believ that it is suffici to consid onli the toxic of the subject chemic to make the section 313 d 2 b determin 3 section 313 d 2 c environment effect the section 313 d 2 c criterion requir epa to consid a chemic potenti to caus signific advers effect on the environ the statut direct epa to base it determin on a consider of the toxic of the chemic either alon or in combin with the persist of the chemic or the potenti for the chemic to bioaccumul congress intend that epa consid a broad rang of environment effect when make a determin under section 313 d 2 c in determin what constitut a signific advers effect

in the case of groundwat and surfac water and soil resourc that have limit self cleans capabl ref 1 epa believ that the environment effect criterion inher contain a limit exposur compon becaus of the statutori requir for epa to find a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgment of the administr to warrant report under epcra section 313 unlik section 313 d 2 b where epa onli has to determin whether certain kind of effect are known or reason anticip to occur section 313 d 2 c requir epa to find the effect to be of suffici serious to warrant report which impli the possibl that under certain circumst a chemic that could theoret caus a signific advers effect on the environ is unlik to caus one of a magnitud to warrant list the extent to which exposur is factor into epa determin depend upon the inher toxic of a chemic and a varieti of other chemic specif characterist epa believ that when a chemic is inher extrem toxic that is it is toxic at veri low dose level an exposur assess is not necessari becaus even minim releas of such a chemic may reason be anticip to result in signific advers environment effect in such case epa could reli on toxic alon under section 313 d 2 c i as a basi for list howev for chemic that exhibit advers effect upon the environ sole base on toxic at moder low dose epa believ that consider of potenti exposur is warrant becaus minim releas may not result in signific advers effect upon the environ these exposur consider may includ among other factor pollut control the volum and pattern of product use and releas environment fate as well as other chemic specif factor and the use of estim releas and model techniqu epcra section 313 d 2 c ii and iii allow epa to consid the impact of other characterist of a chemic where a chemic exhibit signific advers effect in the environ base on toxic and persist or toxic and bioaccumul at veri low to moder low dose level epa believ that exposur consider are not requir in addit to those consider implicit in evalu of the chemic potenti for persist and bioaccumul this is becaus even minim releas of the chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ or in an organ that can reason be anticip to result in signific advers effect this reflect the increas likelihood that there will be exposur to a chemic that persist due to it longer resid time in the environ repeat minim releas of a persist chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ for a chemic that bioaccumul even low level of the chemic in the environ may result in increas concentr in an organ therefor evalu of a chemic persist or bioaccumul potenti may be consid the function equival of an exposur analysi in addit for chemic which induc well establish advers effect eg chlorofluorocarbon which caus stratospher ozon deplet epa believ that an exposur assess is unnecessari epa believ that these chemic typic do not affect sole one or two speci but rather affect chang across a whole ecosystem epa believ that these effect are of suffici serious that addit exposur consider are not warrant becaus of the scope of their impact and the well document evid support the advers effect epa request comment

toxic carcinogen mutagen development and reproduct effect neurotox and environment effect inform on the environment fate was also review for each chemic propos for addit to epcra section 313 in this rulemak epa conduct an extens hazard assess and where appropri an analysi of exposur to determin whether the chemic met one or more of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria this hazard assess is discuss in detail in unit ii 3 of this preambl onli after this care review was a final determin made as to whether one of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria was met for each individu chemic or
