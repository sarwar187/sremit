mani peopl that the cis is a new version of the former union where there is a singl center to which one can turn on ani occas this as we see it is an incorrect view of it in the ussr relat between the center and the union republ were alway like those of a rider and a hors two year of experi with the cis have convinc us that even the most difficult problem in relat among state can and should be resolv in bilater negoti as we know the shortest distanc between two point is a straight line and the creation under the label of the cis of ani center a strict coordin structur is a third point which if it doe not distort at least lengthen this straight line we want to reserv the right to choos what is advantag and what is disadvantag base on our own nation interest zoriny whose experi would you like to emul in your reform shikhmuradov we have studi various model of socioeconom develop and familiar ourselv with the experi of turkey the unit state franc china india and pakistan and still we have creat our own pure turkmen model of transit to the market it take into account our countri specif featur it custom and tradit and even it behavior stereotyp base on this we have publish a program call 10 year of well be we need 10 year of stabil and interethn harmoni in order to conduct the reform more quick dure this period we must solv two problem simultan build an independ state and chang from a central to a market economi and at the same time we shall provid social guarante for the peopl so that the difficulti of the transit will not be reflect pain among the popul as is frequent the case zoriny judg from what i have seen you have not alway succeed at the latter the store are rather empti the main food product are bought with ration card and the price went up again after the introduct of the nation currenc therefor let us move from the materi sphere to question of spiritu life accord to the constitut turkmenistan is a secular state but the highest repres of the muslim clergi particip in the work of all the most import confer the presid of turkmenistan has issu an edict on studi the fundament of religion in school is this not turn out that the reviv of interest in islam is move and take hold at the top and is this not pander to fundamentalist forc shikhmuradov for mani long year our peopl were physic separ from religion even though it is a part of their spiritu life and if the return to islam seem over activ now one must allow for what you might call a thirst on the part of a peopl yearn for their own custom and tradit the peopl generat their cultur and religion is a part of it as for threat of muslim fundament i want to say that turkmen have never been religi fanat and such a threat doe not exist zoriny doe the return of islam to the spiritu life of societi mean that the tradit associ with it will also be reviv polygami bride money etc shikhmuradov you are talk about thing that are under church jurisdict but in our countri it is separ from the state therefor these question are neither discuss nor resolv at the state level zoriny that is they are not encourag and they are not condemn shikhmuradov the main thing is for the activ of religi organ to be in keep with the constitut and the church has obey the law of the countri this more or less insur us against ani extrem against religi extrem zoriny it is known that you have retain censorship and that there is onli one parti the democrat former communist parti and the opposit has been ban yet accord to it constitut turkmenistan is not onli a secular but also a democrat state so whom should we believ the constitut or real life shikhmuradov our constitut actual doe contain such a stipul but i want to emphas that we are now at the veri begin of the path to a democrat societi we are convinc that it is imposs to creat a democraci overnight it requir a certain transit period which we are now go through it is imposs to jump from totalitarian to a free societi in a singl hour whenev we begin to agit the unpolitic mass where doe it lead the politician remain sit in their offic and the peopl on the street shed blood it is our duti to spare peopl from such thing therefor the principl of moder and weigh step in conduct democrat transform is fundament for us we are now be accus of not have a multiparti system no we will not permit it just so that we can be call democrat becaus we are to respons to our peopl choic i want to emphas that democraci is our ultim goal but the main thing we must do on the path to it is chang the peopl attitud toward properti we have alreadi proclaim the right to ownership of the land and we have adopt a whole packag of law which show the irrevers of our movement toward the market we think that onli with the creation of a class of owner

have noth to do with women although a few femal skeleton were found in the nearbi cemeteri there was a strict hierarchi quit a lot of wash endless pray and denunci of polygami a practic which was not uncommon among richer jew at this date the administr includ a chaplain or priest and two posit whose titl could be render as bursar and warden it is not clear whether the bursar was distinct from the warden or whether one man dealt with both task accord to professor geza verm a lead author in the studi of the scroll and author of the soundest book on them in english the communiti describ itself as the son of light rever the wisdom of a found teacher of righteous and hate the memori of a wick priest in it histori they also believ that they were fight a holi war which was about to erupt in the final drama of the end of the world in the earli 1980s there were time in my own qumran of a librari when i idl felt that their life did not sound so veri differ from my oxford colleg still all male and confront with the demonis mrs thatcher sinc the mid 1980s almost everi element in this pictur has been attack we have been told that the religi headquart was realli a fortress although it water suppli was expos to attack and that it scroll are a rag bag from various group and place although the main batch have a coher which refut this notion more radic the resid have been seen as milit zealot liter bent on holi war although their languag was clear metaphor worst of all they have been equat with earli christian at a time when christian in palestin were known as nazaren suppos deriv from the same root as one term for the sect in the scroll their rever teacher of righteous could be jesus himself and the wick priest could be none other than st paul or at least paul could have gone in his jewish phase to persecut this group in damascus a term which is loos use in one of their text all these theori are unten especi the most recent christian one which are absolut rubbish howev they have arisen from and have been exacerb by impati with the offici team of publish who had sat on the remain scroll for too long here there has been a breakthrough which is the public achiev of 1991 92 it began when two hebrew scholar in cincinnati publish their own reconstruct of unpublish scroll ingeni base them on a publish dictionari of all word use in the dead sea text their version has turn out to be remark accur among all the fuss it then emerg sensat that the huntington librari in california was hold photograph of the unpublish text and in the face of offici protest from israel the librari went ahead and publish the lot meanwhil a compar bunch of facsimil were rapid made avail from jerusalem for studi in oxford under the guidanc of prof verm they are a fit tribut to his year of contribut to the text correct interpret at last the scroll are where they should be out in the open under scholar scrutini this year has also seen the first access translat and commentari by professor robert eisenmann and michael wise entitl the dead sea scroll uncov unfortun their own theori on the text signific are not reliabl most reader may well wonder whi this continu battl matter except to specialist it depend on who you are mani peopl but especi jew are intrigu to discov yet more varieti in the judaism of the year from c150 bc to 50 ad we cannot talk of orthodoxi or a singl way despit older textbook on the subject the sect in the scroll were neither pharise nor sadduce it member live in bitter hatr of the exist templ hierarchi although they sent offer to the templ itself and hope for a replac their calendar was eccentr their view of histori was lopsid they studi horoscop and astrolog and aspir to heaven vision they call fellow jew son of dark they also rule that leader must retir at 60 becaus god then enfeebl man intellig and that no member should deal with outsid without charg a price despit these sensibl rule the keenest member probabl led a life quit like the routin of the first monk they had a live hope of the end of the world and a sens that the spirit was among them christian of cours need to pay attent far too much polem has been wast on the belief that the scroll will somehow undermin christian or make it seem unorigin if the text realli do call peopl son of god so do bit of the old testament certain they allud to messiah but we alway knew that jesus was not the onli candid a recent claim that one messiah in a scroll is said to have been pierc in the side has collaps on scrutini on a calm view it is well known though some scholar especi in germani have sometim forgotten that the first christian were jew and that their origin was simpli that they believ the messiah had come as jesus and risen from the dead their impact did not lie in entir new titl or languag parallel are to be expect but the emphasi was differ the scroll do add to the histor context in which earli christian also emerg among their sect there was mention of a special meal of bread and new wine to be repeat in due cours with the messiah there was a new coven and a new 12 tribe of israel the end was immin and a spirit was activ there was no idea of redempt and whatev their great teacher of righteous may have taught he did not use parabl or work miracl or proclaim a kingdom as for the messiah the scroll seem to recognis two whose ident are veri obscur odd bit of the christian epistl to the hebrew do look less odd when seen besid bit of these text it is also fun to wonder if wild john the baptist had an earlier connect with them although that cannot be known the closest link with christian lie in the rather similar imageri of earli christian who were possibl celib in the first syriac text surviv from the middl east again it is certain not known if some of the sectarian of the scroll had simpli convert to christian for those who are neither jew nor christian there is a reassur moral member of the sect believ that their doctrin was absolut infal that the world would short end with their triumph over everyon els that their histori could be extract from exist scriptur and that the end would begin in 40 year it is a point of the highest interest that their text of our old testament book are earlier and often rather differ to those print in convent hebrew bibl this discoveri is extrem signific for the textual histori of the so call word of god there is anoth conclus hard less satisfi despit their self proclaim infal they were wrong on everi singl point the scriptur did not refer to them at all they mistook the end they never triumph they got it utter wrong after the war with rome in 70 ad they and their histori disappear merci the son of dark won at dawn and dusk everi day member of the sect would pray suppos in the

it is true that a great caravan of migrat has begun to flow into our countri our kinsmen were forc to leav their countri far behind throw their fate to the wind they encount oppress from conserv at the time of the civil war were annihil by leftist persecut at the time of goloshchekin and were alarm by racist oppress dure the era of coloni for a time we blacken the reput of these innoc but now a just polit evalu is be assign and we are not be spare in our help to all of those express a desir to return to their nativ land in spite of the fact that our sovereign countri is itself bare on it feet this process is go forward with the direct support of the govern and the presid i am one of those direct respons for begin what is in truth the last great migrat for it proper manag and for it timeli the ministri of labor of foreign affair and of intern affair are involv with such problem as the settlement of our kinsmen return from abroad one in three of our kinsmen in mongolia that is to say more than 50 000 have return we may say that the caravan has start and has taken the road this great caravan will be continu from still other countri kazakh live in tajikistan becam refuge last year due to the effect of the civil war start by religi extremist our presid has given them great assist food cloth and drug have been deliv by special train some 6 000 of the 9 000 kazakh in tajikistan have been evacu simultan on the train some 1 200 famili have been resettl in southern kazakhstan oblast primarili in zhetisay rayon at the time of the 1990 osh incid i was in qorghantob oblast in qolkhozabat rayon at that time i advis our kinsmen in that area to return quick to their countri most listen to what i had to say but some seem to want to continu to think about it resourc were adequ to evacu them those remain behind who did not migrat regret it and in the end had to be remov involuntarili at the time of the civil war thus there were also loss in general it is a good thing to listen to expert think about what to do in such question new focus for migrat have emerg by the end of the year a total of 7 000 person 1 000 famili from iran and 400 famili from turkey will migrat a new migrat depart is now carri out preparatori work the head of this depart ghaziz yesmuqanov pamir kameldiyev and nurlan ralqymzhanov are do a great deal of work first of all they are plan to evacu militari refuge who desert at the time of the war in afghanistan this is becaus they are citizen of no countri lack employ suffer from poor live standard and for that reason should be return to kazakhstan quick the proverb state it is difficult to begin a trek if we understand how to be human by creat favor condit for those come for the first time and for those now leav i think that the 15 000 kazakh still remain in iran and the 25 000 in turkey will want to return to their homeland our butter heal from iran will primarili find a place to live in warm southern kazakhstan oblast the reason is that we cannot send those come from warm climat to place where the weather is sever they might not becom acclimat there there is someth which must be said here we are predispos not to like but to hate kazakh instead of take our countrymen who have come from foreign countri into our midst and make them our kinsmen we accus them by say oh are we to take this to mean that you have not forgotten kazakh custom you say one thing and do anoth we call those return from mongolia mongol and those come from turkey turk those come from europ we accus for their inabl to speak kazakh at all there are now those who assign guilt becaus we accept some peopl who do no work at all instead of act like this and look for problem i can say that if abov all we make it possibl for them to support themselv and help them to get use to the new countri everyth will be fine i do not know whether or not you understand my dear when i call our foreign countrymen butter heal i have my reason for call them this what have your kazakh not experienc dure the time of the lake alqa flight dzungarian invas they put one foot behind the other in the snow and becam white heal dure the era of coloni they suffer oppress as yellow heal dure the time of the civil war they wander as black heal dure the time of goloshchekin they suffer slaughter as red heal there is the wise teach of our forefath that there is a good side to everi difficulti in fact there must be good side to each of these four difficulti the first good side i think is that our kinsmen who have gone to foreign countri have return as butter heal they will make a contribut to the flourish of our nation with their work good honor intent and experi in the school of life it is well known that butter heal immigr are those who have made countri such as america australia argentina new zealand and canada flourish and develop similar three million of the butter heal resid in foreign countri will make a major contribut to the flourish and enrich of our sovereign nation for that reason we must put our white tablecloth on the tabl befor them and we must assembl them togeth in our black yurt call kazakhstan we have mention the migrat which we have recent organ we have observ other disorgan element migrat there are also mani who have return to their nativ countri with their own resourc or by forc thus 20 000 peopl came last year from russia 14 000 from uzbekistan and 6 000 from other republ 40 000 in all all of these migrant will have a favor influenc on the exhaust ethno demograph shape of our republ someth els which i would like to mention i think that god will and if the world doe not end a new campaign will begin in the new futur to move gradual local peopl remain behind in the ecolog disast of the aral to northern oblast and rayon which are ecolog healthi but are still weak in their ethno demograph structur this would compris first and foremost aral qazali and shalqar rayon which remain in the disast area later if possibl we will have to take up the question of return our kinsmen live in karakalpakistan to the motherland that migrat would occupi a particular place in the ethno demograph develop of kazakhstan accord to my calcul if we were to move at least half of the 600 000 of our karakalpak kinsmen live in the vicin of the aral in an organ manner to the recent master region that alon would chang the ethno demograph shape of northern kazakhstan in our favor in a fundament way qurmanqulqyzi children were onc mani in the famili of kazakh who knew how to repeat the proverb a hous with children is a bazaar a hous without children a dri graveyard it has been said that the number of larg famili has been on the declin in recent year what kind of evid can you offer in regard to this tatimov this question is one which is dear to my heart and well known to me sinc i understand the question well i have been endeavor to instil demograph thought and tradit attitud into the mind of kazakh women fact from my own research are offer in my book tale of the peopl or number and thought and in my recent publish eighth book kazakh world how mani kazakh are there when and where have kazakh been driven out when and where have they been oppress shot these two book must still have not reach reader the first copi of the first book were put into the pocket of those attend the world confer of kazakh the book is still not on sale and may never be on sale the second book has onli recent been publish with a run of 60 000 from the ata mura press head by an intellectu call muqtar qulmukhametuli for that reason let me repeat these fact again for kazakh women from what is in this book accord to the 1926 census each marri kazakh women had on the averag 10 children after that the birth rate abat the reason for this were the deterior of the health of the peopl hunger and russian settlement it could be said that the russian had a role russian women at that time too took good care of themselv and did not have larg famili was not this characterist of their begin to infect kazakh women in 1959 the number of birth per woman had fallen to seven howev sinc infant mortal decreas along with the birthrat a demograph wave a new explos appear the reason was that wherea women had previous born 10 children while onli one or two or surviv now onli one or two of seven children die and five six live to matur thus a demograph explos was creat this was a general process take place worldwid kazakhstan made it own contribut the demograph wave last until the 1970s accord to 1989 census inform the high birthrat of recent time had strong declin and we were near a three child threshold therebi we approach a level of two children in the citi and of four children in rural area this must give kazakh women a great deal to think about in particular the market place was exert a negat influenc while the birthrat continu to declin the number of children given birth by kazakh mother in absolut term stay more or less the same the fact that this year the number of children given birth to by kazakh women in the republ will be in the vicin of 202 000 205 000 is onli becaus the demograph structur of our peopl is young the reason is that those born dure the period of the demograph explos now have famili and are bring children into the world i emphas in an interview given to the newspap zhas alash the need to struggl for a fourth child the reason is that if the first child is a son it replac the father and if a girl the mother and the second child simpli replac the parent the third child compens for our various defici those not marri and old maid therebi we maintain our number at a set level it is the fourth child which provid growth i myself am the tenth and last child of my father and the last child of my mother the fourth son but for such kazakh characterist of my parent i would not have come into the world in 1940 just befor the war dure the last difficulti of a time of persecut if that was so who would be now talk to you here about demograph tatimov laugh loud when he said this qurmanqulqyzi one of the question which you have rais and which has gain the attent of the nation dure the last two or three year is get one or two children from women who are still young but have not found mate for this purpos they becom junior wive or second wive to men who alreadi have senior wive there are mani who are against this have you now chang your support for this polici tatimov no this is a veri complic question it should not be oversimplifi in this manner a kazakh has said the most difficult struggl are the struggl for land and the struggl of widow howev today the struggl of those old ladi must be more difficult than ani it would not be too much to devot an entir interview just to that question let me first of all tell who these old ladi are and provid an explan that is becaus some go on about old ladi old ladi but do not know who they are old ladi are those of the femal sex who are over 25 but not yet 50 who have never marri never establish a household and have had no children in develop countri an express like kazakh old ladi is altogeth absent kazakh women fear gossip and remain in their inappropri state today they cannot extric themselv from their dilemma my advic is as follow let us get a child or so from them all this sever advic may seem a littl coars to other but life prove that it is correct is not becom a mother and love a child better than live alon when we realiz that most of today old ladi are offic worker we know that they live in front of peopl for that reason they fear malici word in my opinion it is crimin for them to wast their live becaus peopl gossip there are at present 110 000 old ladi among the kazakh and if they had onli one two children this would bring a generat of 220 000 into the world just like the proverb a voraci hors is no good hors to be call an old ladi is no honor for a woman the word of the peopl are one thing the law of life are anoth there is no need to issu a special law on the take of two wive it would be proper if this question were decid with the particip of the mosqu all we have to do is to drop articl 208 of the law on marriag and the famili it is state there that take two wive is forbidden accord to my research no one has been brought to trial on the basi of that law sinc the war that is to say this law is entir ineffect thus we must drop a dead law which no longer function after that as the russian say we can do anyth which is not forbidden i know that some peopl do not agre with my view on old ladi that is to be expect everyon will not agre with everi suggest that is made there will be propon and oppon of everi innov that is life i know well that when i first made this suggest that there would be opposit and that my oppon would primarili be those women support a fals emancip who are liter and who think themselv equal to their husband some time even superior moreov they inde came out against me and we were unabl to cast light on this vital question onli when this has been done can we cautious approach this question as imparti possibl and in a serious manner it would be proper for us to look at the issu in such a way that no one is insult and no one feel are hurt those in favor of polygami in order to back up their posit make the point that kazakh former practic polygami and that this ancestr custom must be renew i am a support of limit polygami but have no desir to present decept evid in support of my view as shown by the 1897 census onli three four percent of the kazakh men of the time had two wive and those with three wive were one in a thousand thus if our women who have remain unmarri becom second wive to around four five percent of all kazakh men the problem would therebi gradual be solv qurmanqulqyzi it would seem as if anoth of the idea which you have advanc your thought on recogn mother of larg famili has found express in the presidenti edict on this topic thus you are make plan for the carri out of your suggest relat to the presidenti edict when will the day aris when the appropri mother get golden prize and silver prize in honor these mother will onli the number of children brought into the world be consid or will there be other measur as well tatimov inde i am make plan it will not be long until such prize are award competit for these gold and silver prize honor are be announc nomin are be review but no select have been made the golden prize will be given to mother who have born and rais eight or more children in my view the level should be reduc to seven sinc the number of mother with larg famili is on the declin and the number seven is a lucki number for the kazakh the word suffici zhettik and adequaci zhetistik have come from the word for seven zheti and the idea of offer seven of someth of prepar seven cake have arisen from that superstit the silver prize will be given to distinguish mother who have rais five or more children howev i have express the view that mother with three children or more should also be includ among the rank of those with larg famili likewis i have offer the suggest that if there are distinguish mother who rais and educ still more children the presid himself or the premier or the governor of the appropri oblast or rayon should award them a special prize to be sure mother who have born mani children but who have not educ them proper or even abandon them will not receiv such honor far from it qurmanqulqyzi mr tatimov pleas do not hold it against me if i seem disrespect and ask a question that is too direct you to be sure are one of those interest in the growth of you countri and in this regard have come out against artifici abort howev who know better than women the soul and circumst of women for exampl if a husband incom is inadequ to rais and educ five six children who gain from the bear of children who crowd togeth for a miser hand to mouth exist in addit an era of total destitut such as the present and the ecolog environ are have a consider negat impact upon the health of mother everi other pregnant women is anem it is well known that women with this diseas do not bear healthi children thus it would seem appropri that the decis in this area to have children or limit a famili belong to the famili and to women themselv tatimov inde i am oppos to abort you are correct the decis to limit or not limit the number of children is someth which concern husband and wife equal first the woman and then the man mani women do not take into consider their husband view on this question this is the reason for the increas in the number of abort and the use of the loop the man must also particip in determin famili size i think that it would be appropri in the futur to introduc a law that marri women must have their husband permiss to get an abort or to have a loop instal in particular smart women too often think of their own concern and are have a negat influenc on our demograph to give number wherea 204 000 kazakh were born in kazakhstan in 1992 dure the same year 100 000 abort were perform in the republ 50 000 loop were instal and various other thing were done to prevent the birth of children as a result more than half of the children brought to life by kazakh women some 250 000 were elimin the number of children who could have been born but were not born exceed the number of children born we are not say that famili should not be limit each mother should be concern about her health howev the fact that 300 000 children of kazakh women capabl of bear children were voluntarili suffoc and reject make my insid seeth is that islam this leav asid humanitarian consider last year 47 000 kazakh die some 300 000 children were born and even with the death of 55 000 our peopl could have gain not 157 000 but 245 000 we we ourselv thus extinguish a substanti 88 000 of our natur increas there are the lament black old woman black old man black child leav their sorrow alon who is express sorrow for the child never born and who feel the loss there is no artist to produc a song about this or to write word the greatest of sorrow is the sorrow of the unborn child i miss them although i am onli a demograph my word to my daughter in law were when she had had a child and was in difficulti becaus of it my kazakh it is said each child has it own fate there is a kazakh folk say if one extra lamb is born there will be one more plot of grass i am against limit famili with the excus that as the market place has gain so much power we cannot support them let me consid each child separ the first child is alway born for the father and replac him the second child is born to replac the mother the third child is born to compens for defici the fourth child is necessari for demograph law for growth if the fifth child come to life it doe so for the peopl the sixth child is for the fatherland for the flourish of our sovereign countri the seventh child that is an honor number and word which fulfil the desir of heaven when the eighth child is born the spirit are satisfi when the ninth child is born it satisfi the muslim religion the will of allah if you say that we are nine children in our home then your mother and father aqqaysha and qurmanqul are person who have satisfi the will of heaven in the blue sky of the spirit of the dark earth and of allah the onli god i would like to say thank and express my satisfact to your mother in particular and thereaft to your father for increas and make flourish the number of the kazakh as for anemia this diseas is due to dietari and vitamin defici for that reason slaughter a sheep and give it to a woman who has just given birth just as one doe befor she give birth as a qalzha special food for pregnant women it would be appropri if the place where she work or if she doe not work the place her husband work or the kolkhoz or sovkhoz where the famili live were to provid it i think this is someth for local governor to think about qurmanqulqyzi let us return to the question of old ladi discuss abov there are mani unmarri men in my view it would seem proper for this issu to find it own proper solut without some special state polici what new fact and suggest do you have to offer about this tatimov some have complain that i talk a lot about the problem of old ladi there are lot of old bachelor whi not pick on them the reason is that women are the fundament demograph support it is they who increas or decreas the number of peopl for demographi if a man remain unmarri with no shame at the word of great if he is impot this mean noth sinc anoth man will take his place howev if a woman doe not marri or remain steril or die anoth woman cannot replac her the posit of everi woman is special in demograph if a man die this is just one minus for demographi howev when a woman leav the world we must produc sever minus if the woman is young this mean that four children 12 grandchildren at three each from the children 24 great grandchildren from the grandchildren at two each will not be born for this reason in demographi the problem of 110 000 old ladi is more of a problem than 44 000 old bachelor the reason for the increas in the number of old bachelor is the worsen of ecolog condit in the republ some of the children be born in the environment disast area suffer from impot when we spoke of old bachelor we refer to male who have never marri between the age of 30 and 55 recent i collect statist throughout the republ on those assault and kill one anoth look at this inform it was primarili men who assault and kill one anoth their number were three time more than the women i wonder if the increas in the number of peopl kill each other was due to impot this is onli a hypothesi we must look at the question more deepli among women there are also uninterest women frigid women that is women who are not interest in men howev they do not kill each other for that reason howev impot is a great grief for men i have state abov that old ladi cannot get out of their difficulti on their own but i repeat that in addit to the state the mosqu should becom involv in this question howev our mosqu still take a mistaken view of them i call this their social impot qurmanqulqyzi mr tatimov are there question which concern you more than other just now as a person who love his countri tatimov tomorrow i will leav on a trip to koshetaw my purpos in go there is to carri out preparatori work for transfer there the migrat depart establish under the ministri of labor the reason as i have alreadi state is that the northern oblast are still weak demograph for that reason we have decid to move this depart to kokshetaw with the aim of prevent such manifest as separat harm our young nation as we chang the ethno demograph shape of the oblast after that i will be in that citi to carri out public opinion research on move the capit to aqmola as a member of the nation keng on state polici and as a specialist in demograph scienc i will be veri much involv with make specif suggest qurmanqulqyzi thank you", "score":

encapsul of my philosoph and geopolit view on present day realiti it is the juic of my brain the point i have reach dure my 46 year so i will begin right at the begin i am vladimir zhirinovskiy i have a russian name vladimir but my father name was volf that is what his birth certif and passport said mom use to call him simpli volodya and it would have been simpler for me to have been call vladimir

assr autonom soviet socialist republ and then the kazakh ssr soviet socialist republ would be creat by edict of stalin and then in cis time even the independ state of kazakhstan as though russian are mere fertil for the ground on which state belong to someon els are to emerg and russian themselv do not need their own state for some reason russian are not suppos to have their own state where they were born where they live where their forebear die and where they found citi by right not as conqueror for there was no state there when the russian cossack arriv there was their stanitsa cossack villag on the bank of the alma atinka river a small stanitsa inhabit by cossack there was no aul kazakh villag nearbi unfortun the russian word kazak cossack and kazakh kazakh the name of the local indigen popul sound veri similar i was born in a two stori hous where onli russian live and the whole citi was larg russian to this day 80 percent of the popul are russian so i have alway consid myself russian be born of a russian woman aleksandra pavlovna zhirinovskaya nee makarova whose mother my grandmoth was fiona nikiforovna makarova nee sergucheva she had a brother call mikhail

never much meat or sausag we would have sweet onli on red letter day and even then onli ordinari waffl or the cheapest chocol at 1 rubl r 50 kopek domino brand or sometim some other kind it was realli hard live in a communal apart but at one time the entir apart had belong to us my mother first husband got it in 1940 he was a colonel he his wife and five children were given the three room apart for the seven of them but then the war began and they began to move other peopl in as well first they took one room then anoth by the end of the war mom was left with just one room mom husband die of

day and when she die in may 1985 i look back over her life and i felt so bad that she had inde experienc no joy noth but humili and suffer all her life this was clear the lot of our entir peopl my mother and my father were born under the russian empir my father in 1907 and my mother in 1912 they were in torment throughout their lifetim first the czar and the russian empir then revolut and civil war then the great patriot war and those perpetu remov perpetu formal passport registr yes you can and no you cant they move across the whole countri from europ to asia and went to an earli grave their whole life was one big remov so mani citi so mani chang of apart we put the whole nation on the move the whole russian peopl in a cart jingl along the rut on countri road for the entir 20th centuri we got into space we smash the german but we destroy everi famili everi foundat we lost all archiv and tie of kinship how mani peopl were the subject of mix up and were mislaid but how good thing were at the begin of the centuri the russian empir both my father and my mother were equal subject of the russian empir later border would be drawn and it would no longer be penza guberniya but the mordovian republ no longer the citi of vernyy but the kazakh autonom format then union republ and eventu independ kazakhstan whi whi this disast for the famili so my memori of first grade is of me walk on my own in a littl white outfit with a satchel up dzherzhinskiy street toward dunganskaya street where i live later it was renam masanchi street the eurasian citi of alma ata there was almost noth asian about the place but geographi made it necessari to regard it as asian some 4 000 km southeast of moscow china and india were closer to us than moscow i studi for 11 year at the same school a secondari school provid product train we were train as categori ii motor mechan from eighth grade we went to alma ata no 2 motor repair plant twice a week for hand on train we spent virtual the whole workday there from 0800 to 1600 hour for the first four grade in elementari school we were taken by mariya petrovna semisalova obvious kindergarten had left me a disobedi child i was forev clash with the teacher and get low mark for behavior then i move into fifth grade where we had differ teacher for differ subject at some point in fifth or sixth grade i began to lag behind in arithmet and algebra later i had difficulti with all these precis scienc especi as we began to do geometri and trigonometri there were some failur i could not rememb the formula and i found it hard to resolv the exampl and problem to draw geometri assign and to resolv trigonometr formula physic and chemistri didnt go veri well either in seventh grade i began to make someth of an impress and i was elect chairman of the detach council our class teacher was vera yevgenyevna chebotova a mathemat teacher by eighth grade we had a differ class teacher they often chang our class had no luck in ninth grade our class teacher was yelena mikhaylovna blinder i later learn that her real name was esterna moiseyevna she had obvious russian her forenam and patronym under the influenc of anti semit she was a strong determin woman she took our class for three year and did mani use thing at first she pick me out and help my elect as komsomol leninist communist youth leagu organ for class 9 but after a few month she becam disappoint with me realiz that i was unbidd and was not a tame komsomol organ then she use her author in the opposit direct and told anoth komsomol meet to hold fresh elect for my post this was yet anoth blow becaus i realiz perfect well that there were no ground for fresh elect that this was mere her wish becaus i did not suit her but there were some toadi who began to make accus against me and eventu elect were held for my post and i again becam an ordinari komsomol member was this perhap the moment that mark the start of my opposit at the age of 16 i becam an oppositionist i did not like the authoritarian style of the class teacher who did not valu a pupil in the senior grade as an individu but tri to steer him as a helmsman steer his craft and a few small element of my futur polit soul began to crystal in this opposit i disagre with the fact that the class teacher was engag in overreport in order to make the class one of the best and improv the grade figur she would take a book herself open it at ani page and put a 3 next to somebodi els 2 so we had fewer laggard pupil but i realiz that this was fals and she realiz that i disagre with this approach our path diverg in the futur i would never be one of those peopl who would form the foundat of the nomenklatura a functionari suck up to his boss someon who later ruin our whole countri i never becam a democrat russia support and i never becam a communist i was in opposit to both natur the class teacher took surreptiti reveng on me for instanc know that i was go to go to a higher educ establish special in languag and was intend to go to moscow she did not give me a 5 for english languag although she did give a 5 to anoth boy who didnt know the languag as well as me but he was veri affection with her in my time at school i had repeat run up against the fact that some pupil get good mark not for knowledg but becaus their parent treat the teacher well and bring gift to school my poor mom did not bring gift and almost never came to school she had no time but in the school and in the class there were mani children from affluent famili where the mother did not work and could often come to school and often talk with the teacher which natur influenc attitud toward their children my mom onli rare visit the school and there were no gift so i was treat either with indiffer or with distast someon such as i was often chosen as a target for critic in some respect i myself gave ground for this sinc i was perhap not alway veri forthcom broke the rule and whisper dure lesson i was a fidgeti lad with rather cur hair and a loud voic in general i got myself notic and one teacher had onli to start critic me for all the rest to weigh in with more critic i often got low mark for behavior in the result for the term but i experienc no particular troubl at school although i rememb that in eighth grade there was a fight one boy his name was oleg kalinichenko attack me and i defend myself this whole thing was deem to be a fight and we were both bar from school i think for three day then we were put in differ class he in 8b me in 8a and in a coupl of month we were both put back in our origin 8b so there were some incid at school the school director was call selitskiy and the director of studi was bori funder i dont rememb his patronym there were a lot of jew in alma ata both in class and in the citi the jewish communiti was strong in those year the consequ of the popul movement and migrat were clear a factor here from the west jew had head a long way east and some end up in alma ata they were particular numer among the intelligentsia includ teacher and especi among the school leadership there were also german in general it was a multin citi there were uighur kazakh uzbek kyrgyz german jew greek mani differ peopl there were korean there was a korean in our class volodya kim and sasha pak was in the parallel class there were some kazakh but veri few i rememb one khalimova becaus her father was kazakhstan minist of motor transport it later transpir that his educ was limit to just four grade but he was a kazakh so he becam a minist in the republ i experienc this ethnic oppress from the veri earliest childhood i would ask mom whi do we have such bad hous condit whi cant we get an individu apart mom repli we arent kazakh it hard for us to get an apart here kazakh get prioriti mom work in an institut cafeteria and the lectur would often tell her about the examin and about how they felt sorri for the russian kid a russian would give an answer and get a 2 a kazakh would give just the same answer and get a 4 the reason was that there was a need for nation cadr and russian lad would be left feel bitter outsid higher educ establish while kazakh who did not have suffici knowledg would be studi just becaus they were kazakh is this not ethnic discrimin is this not ethnic oppress sure all this affect my heart and mind i was more social concern becaus i had experienc haze in the communal apart when i was veri small and becaus i had had problem with my relationship in kindergarten and at school i had no good friend or a girl with whom i was in love by the age of 18 i was alreadi social concern i graduat from 11th grade at school no 25 in alma ata where i had studi from 1 through 11b we had a photograph taken of the whole class one last time most everyon remain in alma ata just two or three peopl left for other citi includ me there were girl in our class and the neighbor class i rather like there were date kiss call meet there were veri pure youth feel and then all this burn out i was think about the trip to moscow where onc again i would have to adapt onc again there would be materi hardship onc again there would be dormitori hostel all that communal live when there are four peopl to a room again there would be communal toilet cafeteria public cater and on top of that difficult studi in the languag institut where there were mani new disciplin and standard were high all this weigh on the bodi and heart of the 20 year old young man and at a time when you ought to be fall head over heel in love and date girl i was sit at my studi and later on when i was 20 24 it was not the same someth had burn out i had somehow miss out on this particular earli surg of the lyric of love there was nobodi to set me on the right road and this natur impoverish my heart and as a result i never realli fell in love with anyon and throughout my later life i have never met the woman i need the woman i can love my love for my mother may have play a part after all i grew up without a father and on top of that with a stepfath who treat me bad everyth my child heart was capabl of feel was channel toward my mother i love her

anoth until there were five her whole youth pass by while she spent a coupl of year of sleepless night look after each child she had virtual no sleep for nine year she did not get on with her relat

higher educ establish i want to buy a car use the certif i had earn in turkey i bought myself a zaporozhet and it stood outsid the window without a garag i was assign to the armi and where tbilisi onc again an alien citi and an alien republ i had onli just gotten back from turkey where there had been all that troubl and now i was off to georgia whi not russia whi was i be assign to the armi whi not other that cholera stricken summer of 1970 i drove in my zaporozhet to tbilisi via anapa i stay for the last time in the student camp where i had been in 1968 where on one visit i met my futur comrad the mathematician vladimir aleksin he did not becom a great friend of mine but we kept in touch for about 20 year or even more about 25 year onc again i was unlucki we were acquaint but not friend there was someon els i knew again we met via univers aleksandr a physicist again it was the same stori we call each other we travel togeth to vacat center but there was no friendship my youth i had no luck in life becaus i think i had no close friend in the block where i was born there were five or six local boy and they were all differ but there was no warm friendship with ani of them clear this was my fate never realli to experi anyth of either love or friendship relat with my famili were not all that warm either obvious it was fate and all this taken togeth affect my life mayb it like an artist or a compos who need unhappi in order to creat in order to bring inspir it was the same with me so i could develop a better and more profound understand of polit process in societi i experienc a degre of disadvantag in all other respect the wrong food the wrong cloth mayb the wrong comrad the wrong entertain the lack of brilliant success dure my earli educ in sport and in ani other form of activ in fact mayb this is an object process all my energi had to be focus on one thing if there had been a girl i love mayb i would have devot half my energi or a larg part to her if i had had a veri close friend this would have taken up time if i had had veri good relat with my famili onc again i would have spent a lot of time on contact with them but thing work out in such a way that willi nilli i constant devot myself to social question i felt constant social concern and i thought about societi and it problem about social question and about relat between peopl the constant sens of dissatisfact was a stimulus after all you cannot engag in polit for no particular reason it not a favorit school subject physic say where there are specif law associ with the theori and the subject polit as an art is a special sphere of activ and not everyon can grasp it perhap anybodi can go to a ralli stand there and listen anyon can make a few comment of their own and put forward slogan but to get thorough to grip with polit requir knowledg abov all of the human knowledg of histori econom philosophi and jurisprud and also the potenti to make you want to do this like an artist someon who want to engag in polit must formul his own idea find an opportun to express them and meet with approv without recognit a politician will get nowher just like an artist who cannot find anyon who admir his talent but artist sometim get posthum recognit it is harder for politician a politician has to secur recognit dure his lifetim otherwis he simpli doe not make it as a politician peopl simpli forget about him and his name doe not featur anywher doe not featur on the list an artist can leav pictur a writer an unpublish work but it is veri difficult for a politician to appear anywher in the annal of histori he is usual topic he is of the present my disadvantag person life help make me a good student i tri to find some sort of satisfact from this and i graduat with distinct from the institut of asian and african countri then came the armi for some reason everybodi is reluct to join the armi but i felt i need this i was drawn to polit and i realiz that armi servic would help me even with regard to my biographi becaus peopl can alway ask whi did you not serv in the armi whi did you avoid this extrem import institut in our social life especi as i serv as an offic in the transcaucasus militari district staff polit director at that time georgia was still rule by mzhavanadz he was the next to last georgian czar and first secretari of the georgian communist parti central committe briberi and nepot flourish luxuri under him this was the period i encount but after i had left in 1972 they appoint shevardnadz who attempt to use andropov style method to impos order in georgia for the whole period through 1985 until gorbachev move him to moscow my two year in the armi were veri use to me first i got to know the armi itself i got to know polit work i got to know some aspect connect with special propaganda and intellig and i made a deeper studi of the nation question i had quit a good knowledg of nation problem even previous but the transcaucasus area was differ from central asia here i also saw the situat that later led to the perestroyka factor there was realli no soviet power there and there were no real communist all this rotten and communist scum effect corrupt the russian communist too and the main problem eman from there from the south all russia problem are in the south so until we resolv our southern problem uzel we will never extric ourselv from the protract crisi which will period worsen i manag to get myself a room 26 squar meter it would have been difficult and expens to live in a hotel it was hard to get a room but i approach the member of the militari council the chief of the polit director and some other peopl i paid just r3 onc again it meant long corridor and communal kitchen and toilet but one room was my own i found myself a neighbor valya malik a lad from ukrain who had been to the special communic school in sumi that train specialist for the eighth section of staff i live there with him for almost two year i live on my own for the last few month i got to know georgia and visit armenia and tskhinvali i studi the peopl life custom and cultur for some reason i had no desir to studi georgian in two year of contact with the georgian i could have studi the languag but i knew just two or three common phrase and understood noth more and i did not want to i had absolut no desir to studi this languag i was probabl tire of learn foreign languag sinc everywher i felt myself discrimin against in alma ata where kazakh was the domin languag in turkey where it was turkish but at least turkey was inde a differ countri now in georgia it was georgian and azerbaijan was nearbi where it was azeri i often went on assign i deliv lectur among the troop i wrote pamphlet i studi turkey iran the near east the arab world all this was use for my general develop i gain a deeper grasp of domest and foreign polici process in the countri i was now a specialist a orientalist with practic experi i had been to turkey i had been to the caucasus as a child i had live in central asia all this help me gain a deeper knowledg of problem associ with the muslim religion there was the georgian church the armenian church and the kurd i could direct see and observ them in the transcaucasus and in turkey all this was use although there were also moment of sad my wife refus to come with me she was write a thesi she did not want to leav moscow we would meet most on holiday sometim she would visit me sometim i would visit her this nomad way of life for almost 18 month brought no joy of cours nevertheless i save up a sum of money and return home with the first payment for a cooper three room apart i made the payment independ later i earn the money for a set of furnitur my wife parent help us to buy bedroom furnitur and we join forc to equip the kitchen so bit by bit we furnish our three room apart one time i stay at my mother in law for almost a year this too was unpleas we got along okay i was not treat bad but i felt a degre of hostil and incompat final 9 may 1973 i was a civilian with a wife and son in my own apart but onc again in a remot and inconveni place on the outskirt of moscow teplyy stan there was no subway station nearbi no movi theater no phone noth but a construct site almost at the beltway we were on the ground floor it was cold and in general we were frighten onc again we had to chang our apart we did not succeed in move somewher els in the same block with great difficulti i becam chairman of the cooper work for a year or 18 month and came up with a possibl exchang in anoth block where peopl were move out of five apart so i found myself in a differ block on the eighth floor onc again i was at the end of my strength and most of all how tire i felt at the age of 27 28 and 29 i had a new job i was start out on ordinari famili life togeth the child meant kindergarten and sick the cooper apart was expens and we need to move to a differ floor and that meant voluntari work and at work i had to take on some addit voluntari respons teach french as well improv my english and learn german on top of that i continu to studi at the moscow state univers law faculti night school all this was a terribl workload i have no idea how i endur it my best year were fritter away on trivial concern which i could have been reliev of but onc again everyth seem to be push me toward just one thing more knowledg a better grasp of social problem cooper hous construct famili matter my relat with my in law my job the problem of labor collect trade union committe parti committe leader parti meet cpsu congress discuss of the 1977 new constitut i took part in all this it was like hail like rain like a hurrican this all harden me it did not make me a dissid an enemi but it help to shape my ident my polit ident i saw the shortcom saw the blunder saw the mistak at the same time i did not feel bitter toward the ordinari communist alongsid me they work just the same they were not enemi of our countri but at one time they had been forc to join the parti otherwis they would not have been abl to studi or to take up a post i understood this and i experienc similar difficulti becaus without a parti card and without join the cpsu my opportun for promot for move to other establish and for studi for instanc postgradu work or studi in an academi were limit all that was close to me you see the world as a world of apartheid when your a nonparti person from childhood i had experienc ethnic oppress sinc i had live in non russian region now i was live in moscow i seem to be in russia in the capit but here too there was oppress polit oppress i was n p a nonparti person what was more this was especi keen felt in work verg upon the polit for by virtu of both my first and second educ i was connect in one way or anoth with the state apparatus and with work in central institut where parti connect were an essenti mandatori phenomenon and i was so to speak condemn in advanc to a secondari role and nobodi want me personnel offic would set asid my file as soon as they saw the entri for parti membership n p i belong to a differ cast as it were at the communist parti meet which i would sometim attend they would say now were go to have the close part of the meet vladimir volfovich youd better go so i would go this was veri annoy all these factor seem to be come on top of each other my unhappi childhood the lack of good friend poor everyday live condit bad food poor leisur nonparti status the fact that i had live in various region all this was the foundat on which my polit ident began to matur if i had been born in an affluent famili in a russian citi among russian peopl and had never move anywher if my childhood friend and the girl i love had been right there next to me then mayb i would have turn my back on polit gorbachev had an easi life whi did he ruin the countri whi could he not do ani good he was weak becaus he had it all he was the son of a kolkhoz chairman in other word the son of a landown he live like a littl lord even then then he enter moscow univers and began to do komsomol work he got it all straightaway and enjoy life he did not have the potenti to be a polit leader it was an ordinari career for a functionari so he could not becom a statesman and becam a destroy an adventurist a voluntarist khrushchev was the same he work in a mine then he graduat from the red academi he had absolut no educ in the human andropov too was an uneduc person there is that stupid littl line in his biographi he has higher educ what did that mean parti correspond school well what kind of an educ is that brezhnev some metallurg night institut some technic colleg again neither one thing nor the other so all russia ruler have lack a classic educ even ulyanov lenin he was expel from everywher and eventu he pass his exam as an extern student that is no educ these are student that nobodi want he was grade then he went abroad and practic never live in the countri that is the whole problem there was nichola who was simpli tire the last of the romanov dynasti to rule a state for 300 year natur they were tire and could do no more the peopl who took their place were total unprepar for this and had no ground in the classic they rose as somebodi favorit did their dirti work and die terror arbitrari perestroyka khrushchev spring the thaw stagnat the andropov regim it was all temporari temporari temporari all that link them was the parti that polit organ but it too collaps becaus it was rot sinc it had no competitor or firm base within societi becaus of it personnel approach peopl hate communist becaus all the leader were communist ani communist worker would work like a nonparti person a communist kolkhoz member would work just like a nonparti kolkhoz member a nonparti lectur would teach just like a communist lectur but the hatr aros becaus all the leader in the countri from the team leader on a construct project to minist were exclus cpsu member so everi shortcom was link with the parti the bribe the failur in the economi the failur to keep promis the failur in foreign polici the various clash and conflict everyth was link with it with the parti wherev someon turn with ani problem everywher he would run up against a communist communist were everywher so to speak so slight anticommun ripen in peopl mind even befor perestroyka dure the period of perestroyka when they began to preach anticommun at the top this becam a current a sick an ideolog and took hold of the mind of million of peopl it is now difficult for the new communist to succeed veri difficult anticommun is firm establish in the mind of million of potenti voter this help me to form a foundat i did not becom a fierc anticommunist so i did not find myself among the dissid i was not jail i was not thrown into a mental hospit i was not forc to leav i was not talent enough to write someth or make someth that could be ban not put on show or not public so i did not experi harass by the author there was some slight pressur with regard to my career i could not work where i want to i could not fill the post i want to but all these negat experi brick by brick form the foundat and when certain extern condit were creat this combin with my accumul inner posit potenti for polit activ at 30 have reach the age of matur i want to realli engag in polit and to be in some new polit parti without fail i dream that this parti would have it own deputi in parliament when it becam a multiparti parliament and i dream of head the parliamentari opposit my parti faction in parliament mayb in the long term of get a ministeri post i had thought about high post befor as well but this was not ani kind of an obsess with me or a soldier dream of becom a general it was just that i saw these peopl their entourag their inabl to lead the countri i realiz that these dull wit sometim simpli stupid peopl reach the height mere thank to the system that allow them to do so under a multiparti system i was sure talent peopl would have more opportun to pursu their own polit career so i did not set the aim of necessarili becom presid i had an initi aim to creat or join a new polit parti to get into parliament and to act within the framework of the faction of the polit parti thank to which i had gotten into parliament in order to uphold my parti idea there work to increas it prestig and ensur that it becam the rule parti for me as an individu there was never ani fanatic about necessarili reach ani particular height but there probabl was fanatic about implement the goal the idea whose support i had becom this also find express in ensur that we all begin to live well in our countri becaus when i was not abl to work where i wish this may have humili and aggriev me but i never dream of take reveng on anyon becaus i had not been allow to becom a diplomat and had not been given the opportun to work in the foreign ministri or other prestigi institut i was prepar to find my nich in anoth sphere and to make use of my potenti but even in earli childhood someth dawn on me it was a kind of ultim idea which was like the intellect govern the world even when i was a small boy walk along the quiet street from home toward the nikolskaya church and nikolskiy market there was someth even then as a barefoot boy thought of someth great were hover in my head at that time i could not grasp this in specif term but even then i intuit foresaw that i was obvious destin for big leagu polit and this came to pass this was no accid occasion some of my oppon say where did he come from we never knew him we were stuck in jail we were in the cpsu we were abroad but where did he pop up from all of a sudden he wasnt in jail or in the cpsu or in a mental hospit or abroad he was not part of the galaxi of peopl who were expel or exil and whose work were not print this has evok wari even bitter and mistrust and envi of cours an educ man with two univers degre who speak european languag where did he pop up from this throwback to the prosper russia of the last centuri the rest felt themselv to be misfit proletarian member of the unknown and unrecogn intelligentsia i have natur occupi a special nich in the russian polit arena in the last few year but this follow organ from my previous life my subsequ career was this after the armi i work in the committe for the defens of peac in the intern relat section there happen to be a vacanc for a consult who knew french which was not a veri popular languag in moscow so i turn up have onli just finish my servic in the armi in polit organ i was hire at the time i was still a komsomol member i think i was veri lucki despit everyth there has been some luck in my life after all there might have been a vacanc for a consult on africa i did a lot of work with deleg from western countri franc belgium switzerland itali and a number of other countri i took part in hold the congress of peac support in moscow in octob 1973 and the world congress of youth and student which was held in berlin that same year in the summer i think i plung into real polit life with the broadest contact even when i was studi at the institut of asian and african countri i work as a translat with various deleg via the writer union and other organ i had veri frequent contact with foreign a lot of foreign studi at our univers on the lenin hill at the time in the student resid i veri much want to share a room or at least an apart with a frenchman but for a year i had to share with a mongolian the student depart onc told me to share an apart with an italian but for some reason i thought that i would not need italian and i refus i was probabl wrong to do so knowledg of italian would perhap have come in use for me now nevertheless i want to use even share an apart with a foreign student in order to improv my linguist knowledg thus the foreign element in my life was a constant presenc and i was surround from childhood by repres of differ peopl so the follow was a concept close to my heart there are differ cultur differ civil differ mental i could not be an isol chauvinist wear nation blinder i am in favor of the broadest develop the most import thing is that there be no enmiti no domin by ani one nation no discrimin this conscious develop gradual i studi south kazakhstan central asia then the whole of russia and moscow i work abroad i had contact with foreign deleg from western europ and america i help prepar intern congress and eventu my planetari world outlook began to emerg we are all citizen of the same planet i had frequent contact with an organ like world federalist which even at that time 30 50 year ago began to preach the idea of the all european home and dr max khabbit surnam as transliter a swiss lawyer who was a candid for the post of presid of the swiss confeder was a good acquaint of mine we had a lot of contact he invit me to visit him but at that time it was veri difficult to visit a nonrel in a capitalist countri so our contact were most limit to him come here he visit moscow sever time and gave me his literatur in the armi my work was also connect with foreign affair and i studi the near east and at the same time the west and other region my subsequ work also made it possibl one way or anoth to have contact with foreign even at the mir publish hous where i work for the last few year befor i quit for big leagu polit there were foreign and i had to conclud contract with foreign firm all this help to ensur that i studi foreign experi a great deal at work so my entir labor activ help ultim to develop my world outlook and inner concept knowledg of econom for instanc mir was a major publish hous it encompass product cultur ideolog and legal work all sphere i know econom not from textbook but from practic experi plant agricultur enterpris work in various institut busi trip i was lucki i travel the whole countri from izmail to chukotka i would go on leav by air i have long known our whole countri it come as no revel to me what peopl live in what region in our countri what their religion way of life and problem are and so forth i am veri familiar with all this i have seen it all i have often talk with peopl on train and chat on aircraft everyth i had accumul by the age of 45 can be describ as experi of life and a degre of world wisdom and i am not brag here after all some 25 year old boy regard themselv as politician becaus they have read a few slender theoret book but a young man who has graduat from a medic institut is not yet a surgeon it take time for him to gain experi this is especi necessari for a politician you get talent surgeon even of 30 and 28 year old physicist and doctor of scienc but it is veri difficult for a politician to show his mettl in everi respect at a young age becaus you have to have knowledg of life you cannot skip this stage at the age of 28 or 29 you cannot travel everywher learn everyth and have an all around educ all this is difficult it take year and year matur arriv somewher around the age of 40 the time of wisdom begin and a person is now capabl of make decis and answer for them after all it is one thing to be a polit scientist studi polit as a scienc as a subject it is a differ matter to be an activ politician capabl of make a decis two year ago i took part in a roundtabl at the nauka publish hous at the end of the session the moder ask the repres of other parti there were sever of them there are you readi to form a govern right now they were dismay they said no we need to hold consult we need to give it some thought but when they turn to me i repli yes were readi that is also the differ you can describ yourself as a polit parti but not take part in elect and not be abl or readi to put forward your candid for deputi in a local repres organ or at some higher level let alon a candid for presid elect were held for the presid of russia no parti put forward it candid yet there are 43 parti in the countri today and around 100 differ movement and organ but there were not 40 candid for presid there was just one candid from a polit parti myself mani may regard themselv as politician but they will be dilettant it the same with sport littl kid play soccer in everi back yard especi in the countrysid but they cannot call themselv footbal and high class sportsmen you get pilot of differ level too you get pilot of agricultur crop sprayer and pilot cosmonaut some go into space other fli at a height of 300 meter and spray pesticid both perform a necessari job but the level of the job is differ it the same in medicin there is the nurs who hand the surgeon the instrument but it is the lead surgeon who stand at the oper tabl hes the one who save the patient although the nurs who hand him the instrument is also necessari like the one who steril the instrument and the one who prepar the patient for the oper but they have differ level of knowledg in polit situat sometim aris where you have to save a countri you have to make decis on that level take gorbachev in foro in august 1991 he could have act differ everyth depend on him alon and event would have develop quit differ becaus a statesman a politician who consid the possibl of occupi top state post that is an except special sphere of labor activ you cannot be just an averag worker here you can be an ordinari engin doctor or coach but polit which involv the live of million of peopl is the most respons of job you could not think up anyth more respons even the defens minist has less respons he onli has the arm forc but here you have the whole countri and sometim the whole planet becaus a great thermonuclear power like russia or america or china mean make decis on a planetari scale this is no task for lightweight mani young peopl are tri to creat parti today but these are fli by night parti parti as a fashion ive got a parti im the parti leader we publish our own newspap we hold a congress we demand that so and so resign that so and so be punish that is mere play at polit and it is come to an end that is scum that will pass ani world countri is left with five or six parti that make up the polit spectrum but 40 50 or 100 parti will not exist for long of cours we need time now after all peopl want to express themselv especi in our countri where for there was a singl parti regim for so long natur after such a singl parti regim there will be a veri veri multiparti regim but eventu everyth will be reduc to a three four or five parti system that is suffici to express the basic polit view of the popul and group of voter i think that to engag in polit is use nobl and danger all at onc like ani other profess but educ is essenti here essenti when i read the biographi of the leader of some of russia polit parti i often find categori five electrician or chess player or writer or biologist this alway astonish me how can you engag in polit when you have such a narrow base of knowledg you need extrem broad horizon here you need knowledg of philosophi histori philolog literatur sociolog jurisprud polit scienc the broadest spectrum you need to be a bit of a journalist writer leader and orat to know foreign languag and to have a grasp of econom problem ecolog child rais the activ of law enforc bodi and state secur the armi young peopl sport art you have to studi a great mani problem a writer is free to write about anyth but he can avoid touch on a topic where his knowledg is poor a polit leader has to have knowledg in all sphere you cant be a lath oper one day and a parti leader the next he know all about it now he say we will have a russian republ and that that we will have noth and this parti too will soon ceas to exist but it is everybodi right to proclaim their own parti and to believ that they are capabl even of head the govern there noth to be done i great respect them viktor ivanovich korchagin barkashov the writer limonov and a number of other figur are also tri to head polit group but it would be better for each person to mind his own busi russia has veri often been run by technic specialist almost all of them went to technic higher educ establish some to agricultur institut some to trade institut but there have been almost no peopl in the countri leadership with an educ in the human still less a doubl one and there have never been peopl in the leadership with a fluent knowledg of european languag and experi of foreign countri befor they have come to power there are even fewer peopl with a good knowledg of their own countri they would not have discov it even if they had had 60 year polit you need to have a lot of free time for this and a father with a lot of children will natur be unabl to go in for this becaus he has to devot all his emot and physic effort to his famili i have never been deepli in love with my wife our person relationship has been ok but we have not been head over heel in love so i have been abl to conserv my strength for polit the same goe for my attitud toward my son at one time dure the earliest stage i felt more affection toward him but now that he is over 20 all this has in practic becom veri moder and extrem calm so i have plenti of time which is taken up by polit activ i have to read a huge quantiti of all sort of newspap the program of various parti leaflet proclam religi and philosoph literatur econom and histor literatur memoir and literatur on geographi and the most divers field of knowledg sociolog the arm forc foreign countri foreign parti twenti year ago i wrote a monograph entitl turkey polit parti so i have been studi the systemat of parti for mani year i have given veri long thought to the machineri of state power what doe it consist of what are the compon of the machineri of state power how are societi and the state administ you cannot come to grip with this if yesterday you were a physicist in a laboratori or a biologist but today you are begin to think about the state and about how to govern this take a decad it take a certain state intellect part of your brain has to be tune in to this you have to train for decad decad you have to think about this analyz and compar stalin die and there was the popul reaction to the death of stalin then khrushchev came along they got rid of khrushchev then brezhnev was general secretari then they remov podgornyy then kulakov die then andropov appear chernenko gorbachev yeltsin i experienc mull over and analyz all these stage and arriv at an understand of the deep seat process of polit life and state turn point i have a huge layer of polit experi on the basi of practic life you cannot get this from textbook you cannot for instanc studi the histori of franc go there and begin to engag in polit there a journalist can go to some leader and interview him but you can engag in practic polit activ onli in your own countri provid that you have accumul a huge wealth of knowledg so for me polit has not been someth unknown and mysteri i have alway want to go in for this ani narrow field depress me an orientalist studi onli the east a lawyer studi onli the mani branch of law onli crimin law or onli civil law that bore all in all to be a lawyer is also veri narrow or take econom noth but tax circul capit money immov properti all this is associ with a singl narrow special but the desir to embrac everyth mean that you develop a philosoph attitud toward life you begin to understand what the theori of knowledg of life realli is i studi at an orientalist higher educ establish and i rememb that in second or third year i wrote some cours work for the philosophi depart unfortun this was forbidden you were suppos to write onli for the depart you were attach to but i was drawn to philosophi to broad knowledg of life and to the law of dialect to understand matter spirit and so forth i might perhap have studi at the faculti of polit scienc but at the time there was none they had them in the sorbonn and in london but in our countri you would have had to combin the faculti of histori philosophi econom and law or our institut of asian and african countri and a sociolog institut then mayb out of six faculti you would produc a faculti of polit scienc but i had to studi lot of unnecessari subject it would have been ideal if i could simpli have graduat from the moscow state univers faculti of polit scienc then i could have gone into practic polit from the age of 23 but the condit for this did not exist there was no opportun to acquir such an educ straightaway and it was imposs to immedi enter polit in view of the specif natur of the regim in our countri befor 1985 that not all i simpli did not want to go in for polit i had alreadi begun to develop my own geopolit concept i dont want to give it my name the zhirinovskiy formula say but the last dash to the south and russia outlet to the shore of the indian ocean and mediterranean sea are realli the task of save the russian nation for when the other parti talk about cut off kazakhstan kirghizia kyrgyzstan and central asia they do not realiz that we are push russian into the tundra where miner resourc are all that can exist where noth can live and develop the develop of civil has alway begun in the south peopl move to the north becaus there were a great mani of them they had accumul in the south and movement develop in various direct but peopl did not yet realiz that they were leav the best place they left in a quest for food and today we may quit unnecessarili drive ourselv into unviabl region and destroy the nation onc and for all so the idea emerg of the last dash last becaus it will probabl be the last repartit of the world and it must be carri out in a state of shock therapi sudden swift and effect this immedi solv all the problem becaus we gain tranquil we gain a four zone platform when we can rest on the arctic ocean in the north the pacif ocean in the east and the atlant via the black mediterranean and baltic sea and final when we can rest on the shore of the indian ocean in the south like a huge pillar we will also gain tranquil neighbor friend india enmiti will ceas forev the quiet and tranquil russian indian border we will have to make the russian chines border like that too and with the japanes we have a maritim border there is onli sea there and it must not be hostil we have made ourselv secur past tens as publish onc and for all from the viewpoint of border by creat a situat in which dismember or the remov of ani part is imposs becaus we will have abandon the principl of ethnic divis and the principl of divis will be pure territori insid the countri guberniya oblast provinc uezd whatev you like without ani ethnic ting the blend of peopl as a result of the economi the domin of the russian languag and the russian rubl and the domin posit of the russian armi as the most combat capabl this is a histor fact we must ensur stabil throughout our region for russia and for the world communiti as a whole this is histor natur it is not an invent not a fantasi it is a realiti we stand on the south but it is unstabl it is ablaz it is in revolt becaus the tribe are again press from the rear the tajik are under pressur from the afghan tribe the turkmen from the iranian tribe north azerbaijan from south azerbaijan armenia is be squeez by azerbaijan from one direct georgia is be squeez by ossetia and abkhazia all this is unstabl they are all in a state of open warfar and hostil and sinc these peopl have often fought they now have a blood feud they can no longer calm down they will alway fight but mankind cannot allow constant war in the south of russia in the caucasus central asia and the near east the world is tire of aircraft take off missil be launch thing explod we must quiet thing down in this spot on the globe there was the mighti conflict in southeast asia vietnam lao cambodia both the american and we were involv and i said this war will end eventu but the war in the near east will not end and may ultim trigger world war iii so russia last dash to the south will also preclud world war iii it is not onli the solut to russia intern problem and the pacif of the peopl of this region from kabul to istanbul it is also the resolut of a global task of planetari signific america too will have tranquil becaus war have end in this region and there are no red or muslim or turkic or islam fundamentalist threat task of geopolit signific will be resolv the last dash to the south i dream of russian soldier wash their boot in the warm water of the indian ocean and switch to summer uniform forev lightweight boot lightweight trouser short sleev open neck shirt with no tie lightweight cap and a small modern russian assault rifl produc by the izhevsk plant these assault rifl are much better than uzi so ani platoon of russian soldier can impos order anywher and even better so that there is no need for this we must pacifi this region forev so that there are vacat center youth camp sanatorium and prevent treatment center there on the shore of the indian ocean and mediterranean sea huge area could be open up for vacat the whole south could becom one big zone of sanatorium and rest home for the industri north and for peopl of all nation all the singl economi and singl legal and polit space would creat favor condit for the develop of all trade and for cultur educ life and the famili structur as everyon want where there are compact muslim popul let them have their own custom and mayb even retain bigami let women there wear the veil and let hous be divid into women and men halv and some of the popul will alway live in the stepp in the mountain or in the desert in tent in mountain hut in yurt tent lead a nomad life they will engag main in rais livestock that is normal and citi will develop we dont want huge megalopoli let there be small town where it is conveni to live let them all have water sewerag small plant and factori the necessari infrastructur transport and communic all this will becom possibl if we make this last dash to the south we bad need this it is medicin that we must take medicin is not alway sweet some peopl in kabul tehran and ankara may not like this but million of peopl will feel better as a result take tajikistan today for instanc it is all ablaz there are gunmen all around peopl are flee abroad some peopl are refuge insid the countri peopl are starv and die is this better than a mighti power that will prevent the emerg of strongarm solut to ani question human live must be save you cannot experi democraci when you are wallow in blood when there is rob and kill when 6 year old girl are be rape children soul are be traumat they are lose perhap forev the desir to live and they are alreadi mental scar special home should alreadi be be built for them otherwis they will be unabl to live they will die after all not onli are there kill but mental scar are also be inflict which make part of the popul practic unabl to function a mine is be plant for the futur huge sum of money will be requir to treat the front line popul that has experienc the new war the territori from leselidz to dushanb is all cover in corps sukhumi ochamchira nagorno karabakh fergana dushanb it is all cover in blood and corps entir famili entir peopl are be butcher uzbekistan decid to expel the turk just think the turk what kind of a peopl are they they threw out 30 000 in a few day now they will want to slaughter the korean they will say whi do we want korean here this is uzbekistan this is no place for korean it is terribl so we must ensur that in the futur there are no conflict cost the live of million of peopl we fear natur disast the earthquak in spitak or the flood in india hurrican sweep across america but sure the element polit forc artifici creat by certain polit forc which want to express themselv in this way are equal terribl radic both left and right want to chang thing fundament forget that you cannot abrupt chang human natur so ani radic element ani extremist spoil the situat hitler was an extremist bonapart was an extremist even peter i was in some respect an extremist russia has most taken part in multilater war won victori and receiv territori and advantag for itself as compens for take part but the fanatic radic and extrem characterist of certain histor figur have led to world cataclysm so we need to mold a conscious among peopl and creat institut of power preclud obscurant wherebi an entir region is cover in blood we must preclud situat where all issu are decid by forc of arm whoever has more assault rifl and bullet get power and therebi pass judgment but on whom on his own citizen so if you come from kurgan tyub and you have more assault rifl you will beat the peopl of kulyab who have fewer rifl what is this a children game who has more stone this is barbar it is monstrous and this too is polit disast for russia have alway and will alway come from the south all corrupt began in the south when stalin creat favor condit for his nativ georgia this despot rule russia for 30 year and dure this time georgia was pervert and infect with corrupt which spread to armenia and azerbaijan then this filth spread to the east to central asia and crept upward and eventu envelop the entir countri the ruler did not understand this after the death of stalin at least he had a definit aim he paid due tribut to his own nation he realiz that the whole countri might have a bad time but at least the georgian would have a good time after his death this trend persist under khrushchev the denunci of the person cult aggriev georgian so onc again georgia was given a let off it end in the destruct of the entir countri mayb georgia was a countri that should not have been admit to the russian empir and today turkey would be our neighbor it would be much less troublesom for us to trade with turkey than it is now when there is this bleed wound georgia between us georgia is in our way we need a differ border we should either emerg onto the shore of the pacif and indian ocean or cut the south off from us behind a great wall of china but in the latter case our trade tie with iran and turkey and with afghanistan would deterior this would make us poorer we clear cannot counten this so there is onli one option we must carri out this oper code name the last dash to the south our armi will perform this task this will be a method of ensur the surviv of the nation as a whole it will be the basi for the renaiss of the russian armi new arm forc can be reborn onli as a result of a combat oper the armi cannot grow stronger in militari commissariat and barrack it need a goal a task just as when there was the task of repel the threat of german occup red regiment and divis emerg to combat the foreign invad that was how the strong red armi aros today the russian armi is bound to undergo a renaiss if it put a stop to the gunmen in central asia the caucasus and moldavia moldova and carri out an oper to establish new russian border in the southern salient all this provid a stimulus for the develop of the economi transport and communic and for obtain raw materi for food and light industri cheap manpow the opportun to construct new main railroad in delhi tehran and baghdad new air rout and highway we need to restor the great silk road from china and india to europ it will pass through russia and russia will grow rich our plant will alway have enough manpow in the north and in siberia becaus the popul will migrat from south to north in a quest for work unfortun some of the popul will die becaus the south doe not current have suffici medicin and a suffici level of cultur so natur surviv assimil and adapt will take place this is a natur process but the economi will becom healthi becaus the industri north will suppli all the necessari product for the south and food and light industri will tradit develop in the south this kind of exchang of product this kind of sensibl combin will make it possibl for everybodi to lead confid and secur live last dash to the south there was bonapart march across the whole of europ to russia there was the march of charl xii at the head of swedish forc far to the south down to the black sea there was hitler march far to the east and now there is the attempt by the american to influenc all region of the world in japan the philippin panama africa and greec so far the american have manag to domin all over the planet but the idea of world domin is fallaci region cooper is better the divis of sphere of influenc is better accord to the north south principl if we intersect again we will again be in one anoth way we must reach agreement and let it be a world treati to the effect that we divid up the whole planet and sphere of econom influenc and oper in the north south direct the japanes and chines can go south into southeast asia the philippin indonesia and australia russian can go south into afghanistan iran and turkey west europ can go south into the african contin final canada and the unit state can go south the whole of latin america this is all on equal term no one has ani advantag here the direct is the same southward the territori are contigu vietnam and malaysia are much closer to japan and china than to us or afghanistan iran and turkey direct adjoin russia not franc and britain the african contin border europ across the mediterranean and latin america form practic a singl whole with the unit state so alloc accord to this geopolit formula would be veri favor for all mankind warm clear weather would be establish over the entir planet cloudless weather without hurrican and storm there would be less expenditur on energi transport and communic after all the japanes for instanc ship their good virtual all over the planet and they could reduc these shipment by open up our far east and look to china australia and the philippin we would concentr our econom tie main on afghanistan iran and turkey for as long as these countri exist and are not drawn into russia orbit becom a compon part of the russian state and europ would trade success with africa especi as franc and britain have coloni there and old connect both world order in general and econom order via extern tie would be establish we would also save the planet environment there would be fewer aircraft fli around after all they now fli from istambul to africa but they could fli most here to the north and get what they need here the number of region would decreas and fewer aircraft would fli from russia to take good to africa the refocus of contact and tie on the nearbi region on neighbor would be cheaper and would requir less energi we would make it easier for peopl to exist on the planet and there would be no need to scatter the armi the russian armi was in angola mozambiqu ethiopia cuba nicaragua and vietnam but this is pointless it is too far away it is too expens our armi would be onli on russia territori on the shore of the indian ocean and mediterranean sea no further afield further down there is friend iraq so everyth would be reduc space would be freed up and the energi need for the product of food and medicin and for leisur would be releas there would be fewer militari base becaus confront would decreas what would be the point of america ring russia with base or in our submarin sail around hudson bay off american shore it is more advantag for us to concentr our effort here in the south the persian gulf the mediterranean sea everyth immedi around russia and everybodi els would act in a similar way look a bit closer at hand closer to home for instanc i have live all over the countri but if i had live in just one citi in alma ata i would have save money i would have a littl orchard i would have an apart and acquaint but i have travel all over the countri i have had to start over i have expend tremend effort energi and resourc so if we stay put and act local in the area around us and near to us we would have better live condit all peopl seek this so the idea of the last dash to the south is nobl it entail onli posit consequ howev despit everyth this is a method of treatment and it is possibl that someon may have a negat reaction but this is a solut of world problem and not everyon can be happi today america is blockad iraq libya and serbia are the peopl of these countri happi but america believ it is act correct and if we blockad afghanistan iran and turkey mayb some resid of these countri will be unhappi but the world world must believ that if russia has to do this this is fine you have to proceed from the will of the major it is to the advantag of the major of mankind for the muslim world to be cut up rassechen the muslim danger must be prevent other religion are incap of lead to religi war today the turkic speak world must be cut up for onli there is the task set of creat a turkic state from istanbul to altay other countri have no such impuls to creat a greater ireland a greater nigeria a greater panama final russia southern border are troubl they perturb both russia itself and the whole of europ from all viewpoint the last dash to the south the russian armi campaign culmin in an outlet to the shore of the indian ocean and mediterranean sea spell freedom for 20 million kurd and hundr of thousand of baluchi pushtun dari and repres of other peopl inhabit the region it mean preclud the possibl of war between iran and iraq between iran and turkey between afghanistan and tajikistan and between pakistan and india the hundr of million of peopl inhabit this region will be abl to avoid the bitter fate of refuge final we will prevent thermonuclear war explos at nuclear station and the mass extermin of peopl and the death of huge number of peopl as a result of various epidem spread all over the countri at present the pros of carri out this oper consider outweigh the con which may natur be perceiv and the russian armi also need this so that our guy can flex their muscl tire as they are of haze instead of sit around in barrack in the depth of russia wait for the end of their term of servic not know where the enemi is who the adversari is or what they need to prepar themselv moral and physic for this would be a cleans for us all and the peal of bell in russian orthodox church on the shore of the indian ocean and mediterranean sea would proclaim peac to the region peopl fratern to the peopl prosper affluenc tranquil and an end to ani militari conflict and interethn clash it would be good for us all becaus everybodi would gain the onli one who might not like this is america but it will not interfer the other scenario for the develop of event is too serious for it if it interven there will be too mani negat consequ if it imped the establish of russia southern border russia will onli do what is foreordain and will fulfil the great histor mission liber the world from war which alway begin in the south and this oper the last dash to the south is not the barbarossa plan hitler plan for the invas of russia not napoleon plan not the militari ventur of swedish king charl xii it is a pure russian variant it has been elabor by russia veri fate otherwis russia will be unabl to develop and will perish and we will be cram with nuclear station and nuclear weapon which will eventu blow up and destroy the whole planet we cannot allow this to happen so everybodi must agre that russia must inevit establish it own border in a new region and let tajik turkmen and uzbek live freeli there but there must be no nation entiti there at one time in central asia just 60 or 70 year ago there was just khiva urgench khorezm fergana and tashkent there was no uzbek ssr the children of differ peopl live in these citi republ or citi khanat and today let there again be a multitud of citi bukhara khorezm tashkent urgench kabul dushanb pyandzh pamir tehran tabriz differ citi republ territori unit kurdistan with it capit in diyarbakir armenia will restor it border the western border of armenia will debouch onto the shore of the black sea georgia will get the littl bit of the black sea south of batumi in order to compens for it loss in abkhazia they will all get what they want okay they will be a bit unhappi in ankara okay some peopl will be unhappi in tehran and kabul but million of peopl and the entir planet will receiv a posit solut ultim the turk came to istanbul from somewher near tashkent and tashkent remain a citi to which they can return it is their birthplac or they can stay where they are current live but the kurd armenian baluchi and hundr of other peopl must not be oppress and how mani greek bulgarian and other slav are there in istanbul whi do they have to conceal their nation whi cant they use their own languag this will be a multilingu world but of cours from constantinopl to kabul it will choos one languag for communic as they have done in the citi of sukhumi there they have chosen not georgian not abkhazian not greek not armenian but the russian languag it is easier for them all to speak russian than to learn five languag and throughout this new space extend to the shore of the indian ocean everybodi will speak russian dozen of differ peopl of differ religion turkic speaker and farsi speaker slav and greek kurd and arab this will be a common motherland for all but a motherland without war becaus the border will be secur the indian ocean and further north the limitless expans of russia and russian armi garrison like beacon warn of the danger of resort to arm all question will be resolv onli by peac mean everyon will do what they like and pursu the way of life that is closest to them if we do not pacifi uspokoit this region disturb corrupt diseas and war will rise higher and engulf the whole of russia and then we will have the situat where someon had to cut off a finger to avoid gangren but refus to do so and then he die becaus the gangren affect his entir bodi it the same in the histori of mankind mayb the right of a small group of citizen have to be infring but even they fulli retain both their live and their way of life and tranquil is establish for million of peopl and the danger that they will be extermin or hurt in ani way is preclud you cannot govern by wave chocol bar in the face of your subject or onli by brandish a whip the main problem remain the nation problem how can envi and competit between nation be allay how can everyon be made to realiz that we are citizen citizen not turk not persian not tajik we are citizen this is my home i live here i work here my famili is here and i must not go and rob the hous next door kill the children in someon els famili and have the right to rape anyon or engag in loot all this must be prohibit everywher no violenc but we will establish correct border we will creat a stabil factor it is like religion after all believ know you have the russian orthodox church you have the patriarch of all russia you have the suprem synod of the russian church you have the major cathedr in moscow but what if none of this exist just cross and bell would not attract this huge mass of orthodox believ it the same with the nation question there has to be a mighti state around and within the framework of this mighti state repres of differ nation and nation have to be afraid of each other and not even think of attack each other clash between peopl must not be provok take the event of februari 1988 in sumgait was this a natur action for no appar reason all of a sudden student from a vocat and technic school get drunk get some stick and go off to kill armenian in the citi this was a consid action certain forc in the transcaucasus had to creat a seat of injustic communist ideolog had been abandon and they want to replac it with a nation ideolog but how could this be done if everybodi took a calm normal view of each other how make the azerbaijani hate the armenian you have to creat conflict you have to creat a small war and they did this in sumgait there was carnag peopl were burn aliv that is terribl the same happen in baku as well an eyewit from baku told me how an old armenian man was caught at the station and burn aliv right there on the station squar and peopl help do it one old ladi brought a mattress to make it easier to burn him someon brought wood branch match and gasolin they help drag the old man there they threw him on the heap set fire to it and stood there peopl at the end of the 20th centuri they burn someon aliv for be of a differ nation it is monstrous can such thing be allow to happen and all this is in order to reviv a nation ideolog to make azerbaijani hate armenian they are azerbaijani there is an enemi the armenian the enemi must be fought peopl must put up with these temporari difficulti but defeat the enemi the armenian and then we will live happili ever after it was on the basi of that formula that clash began throughout the countri they found a scapegoat in uzbekistan meskhetian turk uzbek and kirghiz clash in the osh valley of kirghizia tajik and uzbek clash somewher els in this way it is possibl to caus clash between peopl throughout our countri abkhazian and georgian ingush and ossetian kabardinian cherkessian adygean hundr of peopl it is possibl to provok a fratricid war that will be perpetu war will go on forev how easi it is to kill today i have often return to my childhood and youth to the period of my armi servic and to my friend i have not been abl to cover the entir period of my childhood there were instanc when i was insult becaus i was not a physic strong boy there are also some good memori childish friendship in a young pioneer camp for instanc i did excel at univers i had certif for particip in social work i also had a certif for take part in prepar the congress of peacelov forc and take part in prepar the world festiv of youth i was debar from some thing i had no state award of cours i had no signific academ work either or academ degre although after my first higher educ establish after graduat from the institut of asian and african countri which earlier was call the institut of orient languag i was offer around five postgradu opportun in both philolog and philosophi i could have gone further in this direct but i did not feel particular drawn to scienc you need applic you need to do a lot of work with literatur i was more attract to the life that was realli go on today outsid the window of the build where i was or outsid the window of the trolleybus in which i was travel the live and the contemporari were what attract me and i want to deal with this and with the same kind of polit real live polit this is whi i took pleasur in creat a new polit parti and began to work vigor in it mani peopl were prepar to do the same but this requir great effort after all ultim you have to quit your job and if someon has a job they love they find this difficult the option i took was that at this time i was do a job i dislik and then i switch to do someth i love name creat a polit parti and take part in it work the most import thing is the opportun not onli to speak out but also to attempt to propagand your idea the most import thing is plural in everyth i would put it in a nutshel as follow plural in democraci in resolv the nation question and in the concept of ownership the state and the rais of children a multipl of view in everyth there cannot be a singl line for instanc all children are educ in board school or everybodi work in plant or everybodi serv in the armi or everybodi studi marxism this totalitarian attitud is what i was sick of but at the same time i am an advoc of tough measur in certain situat involv crime and attempt to dismemb the state smash the economi and destroy certain structur so there is a need to make a distinct between be an advoc of a totalitarian regim or be an advoc of a democrat free regim under which some tough measur may be appli for instanc this is simpli essenti today tajikistan they are kill peopl at everi corner how can the violenc be stop by democrat mean clear there is a need to appli strong arm measur here thus in creat a parti i can express my idea and attempt to ensur that these idea are understood and taken to heart by mani citizen in our countri and to find as mani support as possibl the path to victori is the implement of idea via the victori of the parti and it leader this is all interconnect becaus your program can be final realli implement when you have the opportun to put it into effect if the polit forc in question control the lever of state when you are in opposit you can express idea as much as you like but there is littl likelihood that they will be put into effect unless you come to power although it is possibl for the opposit to have a posit influenc on rule structur in the sens that a rule parti can borrow all it idea from certain element of them and put them into effect so the role of an opposit parti can have posit consequ all the same so despit everyth the veri system of polit parti mean that the univers posit desir for prosper find a nich there are mani parti in russia today over 40 and mani social movement and group these parti and movement emerg disintegr and join various allianc and coalit this is a perfect normal process although ultim of cours five or six lead parti will be left but now there are a great mani peopl who want to express themselv somehow they are like hungri peopl after all a hungri person will fall upon ani food he want more and more as fast as possibl it the same in polit life under the one parti system everyon who did not join the cpsu experienc a sens of polit hunger they were total cut off from polit life this is the troubl with the one parti system the point is not just that communist form the basi of the one parti system in itself a one parti system is unviabl in those circumst in general there is no need for ani parti sinc there are no competitor and there is no opportun for various polit forc to take part in elect the one parti system exist as cover for dictatorship by a forc in power for there is a need to maintain an apparatus at local level that can be use somehow to influenc the mass that is whi there is a need for a parti clear this is necessari at a certain histor stage but this was a one parti regim not in pure state interest for the benefit of russia as such it also had an ideolog complexion there was the idea of build communism and also it spread beyond the countri this was the communist second mistak okay have a one parti regim onli in our countri and tri to build communism but what was the point in go further becaus if all the aid that was given to foreign countri had been left in the ussr we would have been a veri rich high develop cultur countri even under the one parti regim becaus even with all the flaw we have tremend achiev what if we had not had these flaw the one parti regim is flaw in itself becaus there is no competit between idea competit between posit they decid to implement the idea of communism here both here and abroad all the effort and resourc were expend on this in ani case you need a multiparti regim to ensur that there are no protract experi if a parti come to power and for five year tri to squander resourc distribut them all over the world it will lose the next elect and this experi will end so for all the pros and con of both a one parti and a multiparti regim the latter nevertheless come out on top plural is better it better when there is a choic here is a simpl illustr from person life imagin you get marri at 25 and have no right ever to form ani relationship with a woman that you have got that woman for all time until death do you part well that fine if there is deep pure honest love on both side but what if there isnt what if it has run dri what if it was one side what then are you suppos to lay down your life for the sake of the idea of just one marriag just one woman in realiti this doe not happen in realiti the overwhelm major of men and women have sever sexual partner in a lifetim even if they have onli one marriag it the same in polit onli more so it is undesir to tie everybodi to one parti to one idea to one blueprint that is deaden meanwhil a multitud of idea make the countri more luxuri like a bouquet of flower after all a bouquet alway look brighter more eleg and more attract than a singl flower like an orchard an orchard is beauti when it contain differ kind of tree or take a birch forest you have to admit it tedious noth but birch and birch all those white trunk it more attract when you have mix woodland and when you have mix weather too just imagin constant heat with a temperatur of 35 40 degre this exhaust and destroy peopl becaus you need spring you need fall rain wind chilli weather overcast weather sunshin all sort peopl need choic and a vari life in vari form it just like a man life you have childhood then the teenag year youth matur more advanc year old age and final decrepitud and departur from life man experi all this he has 10 year of adolesc and 10 year of youth and each decad offer certain joy and some knowledg of life offer it own method of express all this has to exist in polit life too so that man can be free but in polit life itself it is desir to stick to one idea it is good for this to be a famili tradit vote for a polit parti for instanc the entir famili the grandfath his son his grandson they have alway been support of the liber democrat parti and they tradit vote for the ldpr liber democrat parti of russia anoth famili support the social democrat parti a third is tie to the christian democrat a fourth to the constitut democrat a fifth to the monarchist and a sixth to some left wing forc it would be good if there was polit educ along with general educ within the famili itself in this sphere too tast can be establish in childhood when from infanc peopl see that their father is attach to a parti see that he constant vote for that parti and attend it event and mayb is even a member of the parti this is a good tendenc be a support of a singl parti but this all take place within the context of a multiparti system it onli when there are other parti that you can compar and rejoic at your parti victori it the same in sport there are lot of team but from an earli age a youth may support spartak for instanc he alway support this team he like it whether it lose or win he know this team it coach and it player and follow it game this is also an element in social life polit life is part of our social life here too peopl have their own tast their own view their own habit so there is a need for plural there is a need for a multiparti system just imagin that spartak was the onli team in sport and everybodi support spartak nobodi would support it becaus they pick one sport team out of differ one on the soccer field dure match they choos a power team or a classier one that play more skill but if there was just one team it would simpli have nobodi to play it simpli would not exist that team what is the point of support spartak if there are no match no soccer cup no championship no win and loss just the name spartak and it coach like the cpsu general secretari hes the onli one for 20 year and there will be no chang until he die so there alway has to be plural it is also necessari in person life in all sphere but at the same time you need a certain focus and commit to a singl idea a man may have an amor natur but you cannot get marri everi year becaus clear societi would not entir understand this but the muslim polygami which peopl sometim take an iron skeptic view of also has it good point this could be a polici for solv the problem of prostitut a way of combat loneli and a way of ensur that all children have a father and also a remedi against poverti becaus a muslim with three or four wive tri to support them all and to maintain his famili honor this famili is like a small tribe a small clan it has a big hous and the children play everyon look after each other this too has it plus point so you cannot reject everyth this too is a form of plural and in some place in northern europ say marriag between men are permit these are two polar aspect of plural both may evok hostil from the averag european polygami among the muslim and offici sanction marriag between men in nordic europ britain sweden canada but this is univers planetari plural all peopl are made for particular form of relat in the transcaucasus and in the east peopl men includ kiss when they meet in russia for some reason it is not customari for two young men to go up to one anoth and kiss but in yerevan tbilisi and baku it is the norm these are probabl differ manifest of human relat and differ form of them this too is plural although some custom and tradit may evok misunderstand it the same in polit in some place polit oppon are kill their car are blown up there are explos in parliament terrorist act are commit and in some place the struggl proceed calm the differ posit of differ parti are upheld in the most cultur of express there is no malic no violenc in relat there are no call to stifl the opposit take franc the netherland or denmark plural is veri wide develop in all sphere of human relat of cours everi parti is to some extent reminisc of a kind of polit mafia gang becaus it has a leader and it has certain intern law sometim there are peopl in the parti leadership who are not alway honest or scrupul not alway nobl not alway patriot peopl who use power sole to get rich of cours there is a danger that in a given parti peopl with base interest could seiz the leadership and that parti could becom the rule parti and gain the opportun to put it base object into practic take the histori of the latin american countri or again germani hitler and his parti the idea did not look as bad as all that the nation socialist parti of germani what is wrong with that a socialist worker parti nation becaus it is for germani rebirth but hitler ideolog meant the parti drift in the end toward the extrem right sector the brown sector of polit life this led to violenc yet at the first stage everyth was relat calm well mayb the form of combat oppon within the parti and other rival were too drastic but ultim the parti turn into a repress apparatus for the whole countri it reject all opposit and in effect stifl it the leader person qualiti play a part in this convers in franc it was thank to his person qualiti that bonapart was abl for a prolong period to make the french armi invinc and that was possibl specif becaus of his person the same with the russian armi for instanc bagrat or the other general could not have fulfil kutuzov russian field marshal dure napolean war role suvorov 18th centuri russian field marshal at one time play a signific role person alway play a role in histori both high posit and high negat peter i a great czar big reform but the citi of petersburg is built in effect on the bone of peasant serf how mani of them die that this palac citi might aris amid the marsh it is a palac today but what was there 300 year ago and how was it built the baykal amur railroad was built by prison and soldier who now rememb 1974 1975 1979 and how mani peopl fled from there how mani accid occur how mani peopl live were ruin the role of person and particular event are usual assess more posit or convers more negat with the passag of time everyon applaud stalin while he was aliv but now mani peopl are repel by what they have learn about those event when czar nichola ii renounc the throne petersburg rejoic everyon courtier worker landown minist leader of all parti everyon rejoic the end of the monarchi the end of the autocraci but 70 year have pass and today monarchist parti are spring up in our countri today we are prepar to consid that the monarchi was a good thing for russia but back then in februari 1917 everyon greet the czar abdic with delight becaus they felt that the regim was rotten that the czar could no longer govern had been unabl to govern for some year alreadi and his entourag could do noth either i am sure that mikhail his brother also would not have been abl to rule for long sometim we return to certain event and tri to assess them in a new way but they should be assess as they were at the time they happen in februari 1917 the czar renounc the throne virtual voluntarili and the peopl receiv this posit they did not take to the street chant the slogan restor the autocraci on the contrari they rejoic they saw it as a revolut a peac quiet revolut a way of align themselv with the state of europ that had also renounc their monarchi it was a festiv for russia but time pass and now we think it was more or less a tragedi histori march on it cannot be deflect or turn back you cannot keep reassess thing it must be realiz that clear there are two way of assess everi phenomenon czar peter i was great by virtu of his victori but there were also mani sacrific on the altar of those victori becaus the too rapid european of russia had not onli posit but also negat consequ the destruct of the tradit of the patriarch russian famili that too had negat consequ drunken and absente certain date from those day from peter time and smoke and other featur of european life so in addit to civil europ also brought to russia a corrupt element say under stalin regim we were a close countri that was also posit to some extent for instanc with respect to the fact that we were almost complet free of vener diseas and moral in general was at a high level i was at school from 1953 to 1964 and all the girl in our class were virgin and if ani girl happen to give us reason to think that she had alreadi embark on a sex life this was seen in veri negat term at the age of 17 or 18 we guy were pure with a well balanc mental we did not have a drug addict we did not sniff anyth and as for alcohol just a littl at home with our parent on festiv day and nobodi made ani comment to us about whether we drank a lot or a littl it did not even enter our head even the word restaur was consid not quit nice and peopl who went to such place were certain seen as peopl with extrem bad charact of cours this was a provinci outlook but there was a posit side to it after all in the major of case young peopl got marri and the girl was a virgin the young man her husband was her first man and a marriag like that is stronger it is a better foundat for futur famili life everi time has it pluse and minus and we should be conserv we should preserv what is good there was someth good in czarist russia there were merchant there were courtier worker civil servant the polic the gendarmeri the armi the territori divis the insur system the system of medic servic all this should have been perfect but we stop it all all that we could we destroy it and start again from zero you should never start again from zero just imagin you have a famili but no home noth so you go out into the field and start from zero you will die how can you build a hous where will you work how will you live yet when it come to the state we have permit ourselv sever time this centuri to raze everyth to the ground and start again from zero on with the market economi what is wrong with the administr economi it has drawback but whi destroy it a huge number of plant and kolkhoz are work and produc output which we all need so let us creat differ legal condit for work let us give them the maximum degre of autonomi let us use the leas system as much as possibl but whi destroy that is a pernici polici but it happen becaus the menshevik are in power in 1917 the bolshevik came to power in 1991 the menshevik they are all part of one and the same polit parti the rsdrp russian social democrat worker parti or vkpb all union communist parti bolshevik or rkpb russian communist parti bolshevik or rcp russian communist parti or cpsu but it is still the same communist parti so the power factor continu this should not happen mayb russia characterist econom structur is one where the state sector account for 70 80 percent our privat sector will be onli 20 percent whi not proceed on that basi whi do we have to destroy the entir state sector say on with privat and let us have onli privat ownership we swing from one extrem to the other for the umpteenth time in the 20th centuri russia golden age was the 19th centuri everyth proceed gradual the decembrist act it did not work out they went some of them were exil to siberia some were execut that is to say a process was go on in time serfdom was abolish but this reform had not reach it conclus when new reform came along alexand ii and then witt and stolypin russia was slowli gather speed by 1913 we had achiev 4 for everyth in europ wide and even worldwid term whi do we destroy that 4 we go back to zero and have difficulti rise as high as a 3 whi when by 1940 we could have turn our 4 into a 4 plus but by 1940 we were bare achiev 3 minus now by 1991 we had 4 minus again so let us achiev a 4 and by the begin of the centuri 4 plus but no we go back to the zero option and now we have 2 plus whi doe all this happen it is not onli the economi that is ruin peopl are die all the time peopl are die a covert civil war is in progress and in some region it has becom open like a diseas there are hidden form but the diseas is still a diseas it sap the live organ so it is with a covert civil war in tajikistan in the caucasus it is open in the baltic region and ukrain it is in it covert form but it is happen this civil war it is destroy us from within this is more danger the war in tajikistan now may actual be less danger it will end such war end quick the acut form of the diseas can be treat more easili and diagnos more quick a favor outcom is more like the covert form is like a fire someth is burn somewher smoke is come from underground but we cannot find it like in a mine the shale burn or the coal it burn for year and then it all come out onto the surfac burst out and half a citi is destroy instant it is easier to put out a burn hous even if it is a veri danger fire we need plural we need open calm our motherland must no longer be torment she is tire we have worn her out with these name chang the artifici name ussr the still more artifici cis the state has it own name russia this is a histor name it is a geograph concept it doe not by ani mean denot a state for russian it is the eurasian contin it is 22 million squar kilomet it is the arctic ocean which wash our northern border it is the pacif ocean in the far east it is the atlant via the black and baltic sea and in the futur the indian ocean when we have accomplish our final southern dash the state own name is better than an artifici titl the land cannot be divid nation border cannot be drawn in a state which exist 1 000 year ago just tri and divid franc onc again into gaul brittani etc or let us divid spain onc again into the basqu countri catalonia and spain proper after all anyth could be divid itali into sicili and northern itali let us separ corsica from franc let us take away it oversea territori let us divid up the whole world border and custom post doe mankind realli want this we should calm down we should realiz onli a singl state with the name of russia can exist but without suppress other idea or particular popul group without ani kind of polit diktat without a monopoli in the economi or in cultur plural multipl in everyth divers in everyth not everyon understand the word plural so it is better to use russian word divers instead of plural free price instead of price liber we have the word privat ownership privat all it mean is go over to privat ownership whi should we use so mani foreign word we have our own word the dismantl of state ownership that is the switch to person ownership privat ownership ownership by the labor collect etc or take voucher whi do we need a grate foreign word we could call them check or coupon for the purchas of ownership right or find some other name that might be shorter less of these foreign word of cours foreign word cannot be entir avoid there should be a singl languag that unit us esperanto is need as a separ languag not in the form of the penetr of our own languag by foreign word so that it becom virtual unrecogniz children now have to be given explan told what this or that non russian word mean while old peopl fail to understand whole sentenc and word in televis and radio broadcast so polit is part of our life and we encount it everi day if a new person appear in this world he is born in a matern home and the state look after the new generat or an old man die the cemeteri or the morgu is one last contact with the state a birth certif is a state document a death certif is also a state document between these two document there are link with the state everywher you go to school you becom part of the educ system you get marri again contact with a state institut even if it is a church wed becaus the institut of the church exist within societi and societi exist within the framework of some kind of state for instanc our is the orthodox church not lutheran or protest again this has to do with the state in which we live our labor activ state employ relat there are privat enterpris but one way or anoth everyth is link to the state insur for instanc pension again state involv and so it is for everi step we take traffic inspector doctor teacher notari apart block manag fitter cab driver pedestrian cross park bar bathhous train custom hous border guard plane howev hard we tri to find a place to hide we are alway link to the state institut in the societi in which we live a tribe at the earliest stage of mankind develop did not have a state natur the cave an anim skin a fire peopl were part of natur but at today stage in mankind develop we constant have cell of some kind that are connect with the structur of a given state system and the regul of relat is carri out for the most part through polit parti that is what mankind has devis these are group of peopl who adher to a particular system of view on the state system and sometim they have veri similar system of view on the state system although there may be differ parti name differ leader this offer the opportun to compet not to merg into one big polit group peopl differ in their view in tempera and becaus of this we will alway have mani parti if some dictatori regim is in power it ban certain polit parti but in general the way of life the system of exist in the sphere of polit is through the interact of polit parti an artist may be a loner and inde not all countri have artist union a writer may also be a loner but he is still link to the state he need a publish he need a book distribut system advertis meet with reader therefor he is still oblig to join certain corpor and link himself in some way to the state to societi he may of cours hide out somewher in a dacha for a year or two or three and write his novel but he need paper ink inform other book archiv in the end he cannot cut himself off from the state and the same is true of the system of polit parti here we are link we are differ and through differ parti we express our view we seek the success of our parti these are the element of polit life success defeat failur up and down as in person life as in product or work life as in creativ work as for a sportsman or a scientist there will alway be some posit and some negat aspect but polit has it own peculiar it own intern law which also requir clear defin relat a parti need an organ central and local it need rule fundament document a program period meet confer congress plenum suprem council a parti activ take the form of ralli demonstr picket activ through the faction in parliament the use of the press all kind of form like sportsmen competit championship the olymp game train session various region meet etc there are mani similar here generat succeed each other in the same way there are the same chang of leadership adjust of one kind or anoth to program and method of oper parti have their diseas too a parti grow decrepit or sudden get younger it begin to lean to the left or to the right it acquir more liber or more conservat all this is polit life it is veri interest the polit life is probabl the most interest of all becaus it doe not get bore someth fresh is alway come along this work is alway associ with youth there is alway a new fresh live impetus young heart and soul becom matur and enter adult life a polit parti is a school too here too new peopl arriv there are the elder the parti veteran and leader departur may be pain not everi leader is readi to go of his own accord sometim they stay longer than they should sometim this is a good thing it mean that a kind of continu of cours stabil the parti face is maintain or els there may simpli be no other leader at a given stage but there are parti where it is entir possibl for a chang of leader to occur everi two or three year or els a collect leadership is possibl the institut of cochairmanship all this divers make up the bouquet that is polit life sometim it is fragrant this bouquet but sometim it die or is swept asid by a dictatori regim on the whole i person am satisfi with my life i have achiev what i want even if i would onli give myself a 3 i am leader of a polit parti and i have been a candid for the presid of the republ today the whole world know about me not just the whole countri from kaliningrad to kamchatka they know me in iraq as mayb the closest friend of the iraqi peopl in finland convers they are afraid of me they are not too fond of me in poland but in germani they are well dispos certain polit forc in franc and south africa are sympathet and russian emigr in australia spain and germani are well dispos toward me i have support and oppon in everi countri of the world i am famous i have met person with saddam husayn who for two year after the war receiv no foreign at all least of all russian deputi from the russian parliament leader of various parti and journalist went to see him but he receiv onli me in novemb 1992 we talk for four hour in his palac in baghdad it was an interest trip by plane to amman then near 14 hour through the desert to baghdad a week in baghdad a meet with the countri suprem leader on saturday 21 novemb we talk for a long time saddam husayn listen and ask question i have seen the world travel to dozen of countri met with leader of polit parti and spoken in parliament i have been to the unit nation in new york and geneva at least i have seen enough of the world to gain the all around outlook that is need in order to head a polit parti in your own countri mani of our parti leader have never travel anywher at all some of them do not know their own countri veri well they even have a poor command of their own languag not to mention foreign languag so i can say confid that i have reach certain target for a politician both from the viewpoint of domest polit and in term of the intern situat i am includ among the group of eight leader of right wing polit parti of the world along with leader from germani franc itali britain and austria my name is in various directori there are report on me by various intellig servic of the world i am mention in ambassador dispatch in correspond between offici at the highest level in report to the presid of the world lead countri for the most part my self esteem and vaniti as a politician is satisfi but it never was fanat and i was alway an advoc of compromis tell me today ceas all polit activ disband your parti it will help russia it will have a benefici effect on the polit situat and i will do it mayb in six month i will be forgotten i will be a has been and mayb peopl will call me a failur so be it it will be a good thing for my countri and that is the main aim not some idea and not my name the idea must be univers and comprehens to everyon normal live condit for everyon plural in everyth democraci for everyon a rule of law state a multiparti parliament a mix economi immut of border the exclus of violenc from all relationship from all sphere of human life all this is understood everyon want it but i see my place and i am satisfi with the polit outcom of my life although mayb it is not the outcom but just one of the first land on the staircas i have climb up and i will be abl to climb even higher and help the parti i head and help all russian i veri often hear word of support in various part of russia from ordinari citizen be it a cossack from krasnodar kray or an inhabit of the ural or siberia or a muscovit or a petersburg and i am not perturb by the fals data of certain sociolog poll i know a signific percentag is behind me and if russian presidenti elect were held today i would have a chanc of victori about 40 million voter may vote for me and that is onli natur becaus when 6 million vote for me two year ago i was still virtual unknown independ sociolog servic conduct a poll among muscovit this was in novemb 1992 in the wait line at moscow store vote paper for elect for the presid of the republ were distribut citizen fill them out again after the count in transpir that 29 percent were for me the remain candid yeltsin includ did not even get 10 percent each what better proof could there be i receiv five or six time more vote than ani other candid and that is a chanc of victori i think there are still bright prospect ahead of us and 1993 is the last year of delay instabl uncertainti in 1994 progress in a posit direct will begin for sure we will be abl after all to form a new polit leadership and establish a new concept as the foundat of all area of our domest and foreign polici and we will go further in order to safeguard the interest of all citizen of russia without discrimin so that life is good for everyon in rus this may of cours look to some peopl like a fantasi a dream and it is inde hard to do but there is no need to promis pineappl in champagn you can promis a quiet life a life of suffici if a pension get bread and butter chees and kasha in the morn and can have tea coffe or cocoa to drink if he has a bit of salad to eat for lunch a meatless cabbag soup or broth a cutlet and a fruit drink and in the even he has a bit of herring some potato and mayb a glass of kefir if when he feel like it he can drink a glass of tea with honey cake i think all this will be enough for him he will be satisfi and sometim he will have fruit and candi he will have enough money for a bath and to go to the movi to pay the apart expens and sometim to buy a littl present for the grandchildren i think the pension will support us he will be at peac he will have a roof over his head he will alway have someth to eat someth to wear he should have a certain minimum and it mean that some of the popul may even live well veri well becaus peopl will have the opportun to work honest and after that a secur old age becaus there will be no more revolut and perestroyka in our countri we must put an end to all that and in order to put an end to it and secur a decent life for ourselv for sever hundr year to come we must make the transit to a new geopolit formula for the develop of the russian state we must accomplish this surg of our to the south this last southern dash the russian last campaign in order onc and for all to put an end to the danger on the fatherland southern border and to help the peopl who are russia neighbor to gain a peac life and elimin all hotb of war and tension which lead to clash and conflict the southern campaign onc the red cavalri was march on warsaw and this was the slogan forward to the english channel on to warsaw berlin the channel then our cavalri move to the east reach the pacif ocean where their march end in 1979 1989 the red armi went down to afghanistan and at one time in 1919 the cavalri was march from the west via bulgaria to constantinopl and there was no one in the path of this cavalri onli the entent stop it progress and the take of constantinopl and in 1916 the russian reach the iraqi border and they were in northern iran for mani year until 1946 i think so the advanc to the south is noth new for russia this is a normal direct of movement for russia it militari structur and it econom and cultur institut we should feel comfort here both persian and turkmen turkmenia should not be divid into south and north and the tajik should not live onli in afghanistan there will simpli be a liber space where uzbek will live and other peopl too baluchi kurd assyrian and how mani peopl live in dagestan we should all live freeli in this region from kabul to istanbul and put an end to the hotb of war hostil and hatr and ensur prosper and well be for all the peopl includ the russian peopl who would be a stabil factor an advanc post on the shore of the indian ocean and they would be a restrain factor to rule out clash between christian and muslim between turkic speaker and farsi speaker between shiit and sunnit field command and so forth therefor russia should go south and reach the shore of the warm indian ocean this is not just my whim it is russia destini it is fate it is russia great exploit we must do it becaus we have no choic there is no other way for us it is geopolit our develop demand it like a child who has outgrown his cloth and must put on new one and it is not a question of enslav other peopl or seiz other territori there is a perpetu state of war there afghanistan iran iraq the kurd the peopl are wait for some kind of final solut to the problem take dagestan if it was autonom could it exist no becaus everi villag has it own nation and each one would tri to secur certain advantag dagestan is part of russia and it name translat into russian mean mountain republ without ani nation color there are avar tat kumyk nogai score of peopl live there and chechen and ingush and russian and azerbaijani the most divers peopl take away russia as a stabil factor and you have war there becaus even today the peopl there do not have clear demarc border their own nation attribut or special opportun for nation self express even given the exist of russia as a stabil factor not everyth develop success there russia is a platform a buffer a wall which everi peopl can lean on in order to exist in peac develop and not seek to creat it own greater state just as there is no great russia becaus the word great in it origin mean mean big simpli a big countri and it is inde big from the baltic to vladivostok that is how thing have turn out denmark is a small countri you could not call it great denmark there are big tree and small tree a small tree may yield a great deal of fruit for instanc a small peach or mandarin tree may yield a great deal of fruit while a tall tree stand next to it yield no fruit at all and yield noth of ani special use just like peopl a person height doe not determin his posit in societi and the same is true of a nation it is pure a quantit indic small and great peopl this is onli a matter of number and it need not even be mention the nation question need not be touch on at all in futur clear this could becom as improp as talk about whether someon is beauti or ugli what is ugli to you may be beauti to someon els that is the way they were born take bird there are sparrow and there are eagl the eagl is a beauti with a strong beak and a wide wingspan but the sparrow is aliv it want to live this is it life or dog there are unprepossess watchdog and then there are power wolfhound and english mastiff pedigre dog but that is not to their credit it is an inher qualiti which doe not give them ani privileg but even these exampl are not entir appropri becaus man is the highest entiti the highest be in natur it is often imposs to draw analog here but usual that is precis what happen a small peopl is extermin just becaus it is small and unabl to defend itself for instanc today the georgian are wage war on the ossetian in south ossetia and on the abkhaz in abkhazia but they are afraid to rise up against the russian or even against the azerbaijani becaus there are more of them so that mean that if a peopl is small you can kick it but if it is big you are afraid of it nobodi would realli dare to wage war on the chines but they might risk it against the mongolian or tibetan so here in the south we will creat equal condit for all peopl everyon is entitl to describ himself as belong to this or that nation but passport will not contain the section nation and that section will not appear on form nation will not determin a person right in ani way in the long term even citizenship should not determin right someon without citizenship is a person he live here he has no local passport he is a person without citizenship but all the same he is a part of human societi a person cannot be depriv of right becaus he has no citizenship ani more than becaus of particular polit convict or becaus he is of a differ nation or a differ religion or his skin is a differ color or he is from a differ tribe or a differ local there should be no discriminatori factor the south must be freed from this plagu nation chauvin on the part of a big nation toward a small one or nation on the part of a small nation with regard to a big neighbor we must learn to respect ourselv as citizen as men and women as adult and children with a common right to a normal peac life and nobodi is entitl to resort to violenc law and order should be the same everywher human right belong to everyon everyon should be under the protect of the law under the shelter of the law which oper in time and space throughout this territori from kabul to istanbul from the southern indian ocean coast to the coast of the arctic ocean in murmansk and on the shore of the indian ocean we are all citizen of a singl russian state it is the same whether you are in kaliningrad or chukotka in izmail or taymyr in st petersburg or on the amur it is all one legal econom polit and financi area it is difficult to make it a singl ecolog area becaus differ place have differ level of environment pollut we are depend on natur disast and on the pollut of natur it is therefor all the more necessari to creat an atmospher in relat preclud a transit to violent action in resolv disput of ani kind ani question be it drainag system the divis of land hous question job leisur educ the armi draft ani question should be resolv onli from the standpoint of civic respons you live in a given local law are in forc here that are ident for all of us we live in accord with those law and all the command christian biblic muslim judaic thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear fals wit thou shalt not commit violenc help one anoth all this is common knowledg all this is in folklor in fairi stori in sermon in moral teach in everyday life all the grandma and grandpa in the world teach their grandchildren well but whi do some children grow up to be good and kind while other becom murder and rapist obvious someth goe wrong in their educ and mayb there is not enough state particip in this we do not take children away from bad famili in time given that we have fail to prevent the emerg of a bad famili the state should have the resourc to take a child away from such a famili if onli for a time and to rais him in the condit of a state children home school or board school and where children home exist it is possibl on the other hand to go over to famili children home to creat the condit so that adult can take children from these home so that the child can grow up in a famili this will not be 100 percent success but it is necessari to reduc to the minimum the number of children in state institut ultim the aim of ani polici is the happi of real peopl it is not hard to put forward this formula what doe it matter if i am unhappi as long as russia is happi but will russia be happi if we are all unhappi obvious sensibl coexist is need so that each of us live well and the countri as a whole live well so let have less heroism less renunci i am prepar to sacrific myself as long as my countri is happi if we all sacrific ourselv who is go to live in our countri happi and joy constitut the general well be in the countri the health of everi one of us is the countri happi therefor our everi day our everi effort of labor everi moment of our particip in ani polit sphere should have this nobl goal to creat not destroy to help to give peopl joy not to provok their hatr to be toler we cannot have mob of peopl run somewher or other carri stick beat somebodi up we cannot have stone and glass be thrown car be overturn and set on fire we cannot august 1991 in moscow it is terribl armor personnel carrier are move under the bridg over kalinin prospekt and a mob of frenzi half drunk muscovit stop an armor personnel carrier drag the tank driver out and tri to set fire to the combat vehicl is this not barbar after all even if it was to some extent unjustifi to some extent barbar to send in the troop the attack on the troop and the attempt to beat up the tankmen or armor vehicl driver and commit violenc against them were even more barbar after all the troop would simpli have advanc further three muscovit would not have been kill had it not been for this artifici clash the attempt to provok to arous hatr those guy the tankmen went into moscow and stop at specif place they did not shoot they did not threaten anyon they climb out of their tank bought ice cream chat up girl children and adult clamber onto the tank and there was no threat they were our tank they were our boy it was our armi and they tri to blow this up into hostil act of some kind to provok peopl into a major conflict and the result was casualti it was not the scse state committe for the state of emerg that did this but the democrat russian certain adventurist forc who want to exacerb the situat then the same thing was repeat in tajikistan but here there were ten of thousand of casualti so august 1991 in moscow was not three day of the putsch it was the start of civil war in russia this war is alreadi blaze in the north caucasus it is blaze in the dniester region and in central asia it is develop at a slower pace in the baltic region tataria and other region it is terribl therefor measur are need so that the countri can provid itself with secur live condit in the late 20th centuri you cannot play with fire we cannot move to other region and start life all over again we can onli live where we live today we need no great conqueror now no alexand the great no bonapart no hitler we do not need pinochet today either although we have candid for the pinochet role general

stop in time mao idea did not grip the world and the maoist revolut did not go beyond the border of china the japanes also lay no claim to world domin the german have had enough of war forev and do not want to take part in ani militari conflict and sweden has complet forgotten what war is after a defeat by the russian armi the swede renounc wage war anywher ever again you american remain the

withdraw your too the german for instanc are keener for you to get out of europ than us they would rather be left with russian troop in their countri than american and in mani countri of the world there is a desir for you to remov your base american let us put an end to the tension in the world which eman from you as well as us let us not make mutual accus humili each other and look to see who

tension in west east relat and rule out war forev so you american must leav the balkan and the near east the world will say thank you otherwis one fine day it will put you in the dock and you will face the threat of a new nuremberg if your hothead do not cool down but we believ in the american good sens becaus they are a fusion of repres of differ nation from all over the world we have no chauvin or frenzi nation we would like to believ that you do not seek domin by your nation over other rememb you surviv thank to theft under the cloak of state institut first you plunder latin america and africa and grew rich out of two world war and for the last 50 year you have been steal brain and that is the most valuabl thing in the world the human brain throughout the 20th centuri the best mind have been sail fli journey to your countri from all over the world a scientist may experi some temporari difficulti and depress so he goe to your countri to work but at the same time he automat enrich you make you stronger you must know that your wealth is not the achiev of the indigen peopl of america or of those first settler this wealth was creat by russian among other becaus near all america mathematician are soviet jew who left the ussr a great mani russian work in various american laboratori today it is the same in germani where there is not onli the blood of russian soldier but the sweat of russian worker who work in germani for 30 40 year more after the war restor it and make it rich therefor everyth that america has achiev was achiev by the labor of all nation and ethnic group we are today divid by artifici border the popul is now intermingl everywher there are russian live everywher today in germani franc america australia spain hundr of thousand million of russian have dispers across the world the same is true of repres of other peopl there are italian for instanc live everywher in europ and america these are artifici border formal and we should not wage war becaus of this so let us calm down let us concern ourselv with our domest problem and problem associ with the immedi region for america that will be the southern state and mexico and the adjac local the caribbean region for franc it is north africa and for russia it is afghanistan iran turkey peopl must agre on this and not get in the way not interfer the same for china it has interest in mongolia and south asia but it should not be take sidelong look at what the russian are do in afghanistan still less in iran or turkey the same for japan it is prepar to agre to russia have access to the shore of the indian ocean but it want certain island in the kuril chain a solut could be found here mayb japan could be given someth for instanc somewher or other in that great archipelago of island which we have not fulli exploit but which japan veri much want a formula could be found wherebi japan interest would also be taken into account thus favor condit could be creat for all mankind so that our planet is not stricken by polit aid or a polit chernobyl and the russian will have the last word becaus the american will ultim agre with our stanc with our formula for the geopolit develop of the world as a result of which russia will complet the establish of it southern border and accomplish it last dash to the south russia onc save the world from the ottoman empir by send it troop to the south and the ottoman empir which had extend over three contin north africa southern europ asia minor fell as a result of 30 war with russia mayb had it not been for russia all of europ would have been turkic becaus the turk had alreadi seiz budapest and besieg vienna so it was not much farther to berlin pari and the channel and seven centuri ago we stop the mongol we could have let them pass and accept their domin and what would have been left of europ then we have save it sever time from the south from the east from the north and from the center of europ itself when the fascist plagu triumph in germani itali portug spain and greec thank to the russian europ was liber from fascism europ help russia to liber itself from communism we help each other but the russian suffer more loss becaus russia is locat on the eurasian contin and therefor we stop the most terribl aggressor in the world seven centuri ago and again 50 year ago so other peopl ought to be grate to the russian the russian have carri freedom on their shoulder whatev uniform they wear that of the czarist armi the soviet armi or the russian armi we have not enslav peopl driven them into slaveri or made them work for us to this day we have not receiv adequ compens from the german from the french from the japanes from the swede from the turk from the pole from a singl one of the aggressor who have trampl and destroy our countri and our peopl the world should be grate to russia for it role as savior and this is not russia reward for the troubl it has born in fulfil it histor mission everi 100 year it is russia natur develop it is it awaken and it abil onc again to help the peopl of the south to gain true liber that the hour of silenc may come at last in the near and middl east in asia minor and central asia onli russia can help here the russian armi will assembl for the last time for it southern campaign and will stop forev on the shore of the indian ocean beyond that there is nowher to go beyond that are the warm water of the indian ocean which wash the shore of our etern friend india of iraq of our strateg alli the warm ocean breez will sooth everyon live in this new geopolit area within these new border of russia the russian flag will threaten no one and the russian fleet in the indian ocean will pay friend visit to the port of india the persian gulf and east africa we will be friend with everyon and especi south africa we are link to it by special interest in the sphere of the economi cultur and geopolit and these will be north south relat we will not overlap with the interest of the chines and japanes who will have special relat with the philippin australia indonesia and southeast asia we will not go to west africa where western europ has interest still less will our path ever cross that of latin america or the interest of the north american state the world gain the order it has long need with no swastika and no red star no gestapo and no kgb the world want a firm guarante order at long last and the river will be cleaner the water we drink will be cleaner we will be abl to relax more we will becom calmer we will understand each other becaus everi famili will have the home it want in a big citi or a small one in a mountain villag or settlement in the tropic in the forest on the mountainsid and in that home will be whoever you like one wife or three or none one child or 10 you can have cow and sheep or scientif instrument it is up to you everi famili will live by it own law but respect the law of the neighbor famili the nearbi settlement or citi the law is general univers accord to a singl formula do not kill do not steal do not deceiv that is what is need if we are to have equal opportun all peopl are talent some peopl are good at graze livestock some grow flower some are good at fish let us give each the task that suit him in sport in scienc in creativ work in art in ani profess under ani climat we will live peac and there will be no domin ideolog no power will be abl to claim author or the right to establish a world order and we will not threaten each other with russian ivan or uncl sam there will be fewer diseas hunger should disappear becaus there is enough food and we will be abl to distribut it to the needi and all this will becom possibl when russia gain it nation self awar in tandem with the intern not in order to rais up the russian and send other peopl down to the depth but in order by rais up the russian to rais up all those who live alongsid them this whole eurasian contin from brest to kabul and from yamal to istanbul some peopl may say the peopl of the south do not want your help or your geopolit concept we will resist we will wage war on you etern war we will give you an etern afghanistan this is a misconcept becaus in 1979 1989 the red armi was in afghanistan under communist banner if this had been a czarist foreign polici all the question there would have been resolv long ago the psycholog factor is of great signific who it is who is implement a given polici there is no room for debat here latvia will be part of russia there will be a small lithuanian state within russia if you realli want to live in a small close knit ukrain then there could be a small ukrainian republ but all this is onli possibl on condit that russia reach the south and stop at the shore of the indian ocean therefor the finn lithuanian and estonian have an interest in ensur that russia establish new border the japanes chines and hindus also have an interest in this arab and european too this is the onli way they will be freed from the isra trap and america will final gain tranquil be freed from megalomania from the need to maintain it author and remain the sole superpow it will be easier for everyon the world will breath more freeli have acquir a recip for reliabl but the planet is vast peopl are differ you cannot implement a polici that will pleas absolut everyon that is not possibl even within one state or inde within a famili where you have mom pop and two children someon is alway go to be dissatisfi especi if you add a grandma and a grandpa there will alway be a hornet nest alway conflict of some kind we cannot make the world free from conflict but we can deliv it from the threat of self annihil we cannot rid mankind entir of diseas we will alway catch cold which will be call upper respiratori tract infect flu tonsil pharyng conflict are inevit after all just as you cannot avoid conflict between man and woman we will never be abl to make everyon happi without except so that all women get husband all men get wive and all of them have children and they are all live and healthi this will never happen it is everi young coupl wish to becom man and wife to have children to have their own home the job they want and to rais the children but often this doe not happen there is no hous the children get sick the famili break up there are problem at work conflict with relat this will alway happen and it is the same between peopl peopl will still tell joke about chukchi or jew about russian ivan or about the caucasian about khokhol derogatori term for ukrainian one way or anoth we will alway go in for some kind of haze but it should not end in the grave as happen in our armi a river carri away stone sand and silt it move this is natur and man is part of natur but it is essenti to regul the process so as to elimin fascism so as to elimin communism so as to elimin the seiz of other peopl countri land airplan suppos one of the passeng on an aircraft has too much to drink by do this he harm himself but if a terrorist come along a hijack that is a threat to hundr of peopl live we must resist him his action must be neutral similar in a geopolit formula you cannot find some kind of ideal solut for everyon i know there will be mani protest in kabul tehran ankara but whi do they think we should not be oppos to their plan for creat a greater turkic state what was colonel turk founder of the parti of nation order put in prison for for his idea about turan a greater turkic state from istanbul to the altay the turk themselv put him in prison for that these nationalist idea these pan turkic sentiment have come to the fore period but in ani case they have alway exist in turkish societi among academ student civil servant the same is true of tehran attempt to dissemin the idea of the islam revolut in afghanistan this has almost succeed but iran has not yet succeed but is clear tri to extend this to azerbaijan and subsequ turkey do pan islam idea help to improv the world order do they not constitut a threat to mankind to all mankind what about kabul it is perpetu war there zahir shah presid daud the afghan communist from nur moham taraki to najibullah there is no such peopl as the afghan peopl there are various peopl uzbek kharizeytsi as transliter tajik pushtun dari whi should they not live as they wish without break up into gang head by field command is this not a threat to peac and what about the perpetu clash between pakistan and india all this must come to an end some time there has been is and will be dissatisfact with our idea but just as in an individu famili there is alway someon who is dissatisfi with the establish order there so in the big famili of peopl of our planet not everyon will agre with the order that could be establish they should accept it be reconcil to it for the sake of the major just as russia communist should accept that the major of russian do not want the kind of communism that they tri to implement in the form of the stalinist brezhnevit model russia move to the south is primarili a defens measur a countermeasur becaus today there is a threat to russia from the south from the direct of afghanistan which is alreadi attack tajikistan from the direct of tehran which is build plan for the pan islam seizur of vast territori from the direct of ankara where plan for a greater turkic state were prepar long ago pan turkism is a threat to russia becaus it has a larg turkic speak popul muslim farsi speak and all this is use soil a good incent for afghanistan iran and turkey to move up toward the north creat a greater afghanistan a greater iran a greater turkey as a minimum turkey dream of azerbaijan and the caucasus of georgia so as to becom a land of four sea the black sea the mediterranean the caspian and the sea of marmara and even the aegean and russia lose everyth the great and talent turkish peopl deserv to live at the veri center of the world in a fragrant region on the shore of six sea while the weak impot russian peopl should perish is that how you determin the histori of mankind no that is imposs noth will happen to the world even if the entir turkish nation perish although i do not wish that upon it but let the turk rememb how they came to asia minor barbar seiz constantinopl and plunder it and butcher and subjug all the peopl inhabit asia minor let them rememb how they butcher 15 million armenian in april 1915 let them rememb that and let mankind conscienc shudder when a whole peopl is butcher in three night and million of kurd languish under the turkish yoke and cannot live in a kurdish state a bitter fate has divid them a larg number live in eastern anatolia in turkish territori while some live in the territori of syria northern iraq western iran and the transcaucasus this is a peopl 30 million strong and they have the right to gain nation freedom and who can give them that right onli russia the aggressor and his victim cannot be place in the same pan of the scale today we must final understand who brought civil to this world who open up outer space and who occupi foreign countri plunder other peopl drove them into slaveri and burn christian church or turn them into mosqu what cultur did the turk bring to the territori of asia minor tourist from the west travel in turkey are to this day shown the remain of byzantin cultur there is no such thing as turkish cultur cultur doe not go with the bare saber and who form the basi of the new turkish armi the janissari what were they slav boy taken captiv along with their parent the parent were kill but the boy were rais in the turkish spirit and form the might of their forc it was a strang thing for slav boy to wipe out slav peopl under turkish flag who will answer for that who will pay for the violenc against byzantin cultur against the slav peopl there was no nuremberg trial for the turk who commit genocid against the armenian peopl yet what is the differ between turk and german the fascist regim was to blame for 50 million death there were onli 70 80 million german it was the same when the 17 million strong turkish peopl annihil 15 million armenian the proport is the same the turk brought as much evil upon mankind as the german but the german their parti their ideolog were put on trial they were place under intern tutelag there are still troop in germani to this day but nobodi punish the turk it seem you can annihil the armenian becaus they are a small peopl but you cannot annihil the french the russian or the english you will be put on trial for that all peopl are equal nobodi is permit to perpetr genocid today georgia is annihil the abkhaz and the ossetian and europ is silent go ahead crush sukhumi with tank dismemb abkhaz bodi after all your leader shevardnadz help to shake the ussr posit in europ and to shatter the ussr militari might throughout the world and in gratitud for this mr shevardnadz is permit to engag in polit gangster there are not mani abkhaz but they are a peopl they want to live to live in their own land and freeli but they are depriv of that right this is genocid it is racism it is fascism and it is happen today who will stop all this and what about the clash between azerbaijani and armenian how long will this go on until the armenian peopl are wipe out onli not by turk this time but by azerbaijani anoth turkic speak peopl after all basic azerbaijani and turk are the same thing in 1915 the turk butcher 15 million armenian and the azerbaijani have been butcher them sinc februari 1986 that is five year now the turk did it in three night but the azerbaijani will go on for 15 year and they will tri to wipe out the armenian total so as ultim to wipe out the armenian state entir whi becaus it is a christian state it is prevent two turkic speak peopl the azerbaijani and the turk from unit what is nakhichevan it is an artifici format an azerbaijani popul on armenian territori that was armenia of old that has alway been armenia a land of three sea the caspian the black sea the mediterranean and what has becom of armenia today a littl belt of land is all that remain of a great state a state with a great cultur it was the first slaveown state on the territori of what is now russia urartu a civil began there and spread further it own church it own script as for the azerbaijani they are a persian tribe who rose to the top as conqueror at that time the turk were advanc from the east they turkic this persian tribe what are the azerbaijani a tribe that live on the shore of the caspian sea in khazer as transliter that is not the name of a countri it design a local where citizen live it is like the inhabit of sokolniki that is not a nation it is just a district of moscow it is the same with azerbaijan it is an inhabit region on the shore of the caspian sea so there is noth to reproach the russian with we do not intend to punish the turkish iranian or afghan peopl but we want freedom for the peopl who live in the south but today the whole of the south is bath in blood and the guardian of the islam revolut are wipe out all the dissid in iran they made war on iraq for 10 year what for for what purpos the kurd action in pursuit of freedom have been suppress for 10 year turkish forc bomb civilian from the air they crush kurdish settlement with tank so let the kurdish peopl perish and they are by no mean a small peopl there are 30 million of them a big state by european standard but europ is silent relat with ankara are advantag to it there is your european haze let us close our eye to the kurdish problem and then the turk will have good relat with us european and what did the turk do with the communist they lure them into boat took them out into the black sea slaughter them and threw the bodi into the sea that is how to deal with the polit opposit and that democraci that is barbar that is savageri lenin thought kemal was a turkish bolshevik he gave him weapon and money what was the result in world war ii turkey was suppos to attack the caucasus and mani of our troop were there wait for this attack the turkish command had all it plan readi stalin mistak was not to punish turkey at the end of world war ii turkey should have been punish it was to blame for the death of mani russian soldier at the klukhorskiy pass and other caucasus cross becaus beriya did not allow the fresh transcaucasian divis to be use to help the northern caucasus in the fight against the german who were surg toward groznyy baku makhachkala all becaus of the threat of attack from the turk so turkey realli did take part in world war ii just like japan which we punish but onli becaus the american want that japan attack pearl harbor the turk did not attack vienna or pari so nobodi demand punish for turkey yet turkey hinder our war on the german becaus of turkey stanc more of our soldier die and more of our territori were seiz so turkey was also a particip in world war ii on the side of fascist germani but it was not punish there may be a differ opinion and differ view on this and who will be the judg will we russian be wrong to defend the armenian not onli as christian but as a peopl who have over mani centuri been undergo destruct from the south east and west will we be wrong if we give freedom to the kurdish peopl and the baluchi will we not be right to make it possibl for uzbek tajik pushtun and dari to live in that whole area from tashkent to kabul to live freeli and go where they want as long as there are no gang will they not be grate to us and southern azerbaijan for the opportun of unif with northern azerbaijan it is one azerbaijani peopl but there are around 16 million of them live in northern iran and they cannot speak their nativ languag and consid themselv azerbaijani what about the baluchi what about the arab in the southern part of iran they will all be grate to us includ the persian includ the turk becaus today they live on the island of cyprus as if in a fortress under sieg it is a greek island it was never turkish and it should becom greek again it should be a free cypriot republ or els part of greec but cyprus should not be occupi by turkish troop how mani greek were wipe out how mani greek women were rape they can tell you that in athen did the dardanell ever belong to the turk it alway belong to greec and thrace that is the territori of bulgaria and greec so whi are the occupi still there from the period when the great power were at war among themselv now that we are go over to region cooper everyth could be return to it right place here so that there will be no label aggressor occupi and the turk can live throughout that area they can come back as far as tashkent and ashgabat to karakalpakia further down to the aral sea to where they came from in the quest for better land but you should improv the land where you were born and where you live rather than seiz other peopl citi and countri by wipe out the citizen who live there and wipe out that cultur to this day they have creat noth in asia minor to replac what was onc there asia minor greec rome mesopotamia egypt all this was under turkish dominion all this was seiz by forc and languish in slaveri for centuri and onli russia liber north africa and southern europ from turkish dominion from ottoman domin million of peopl are grate to russia for this to this day so is russia not capabl of one last gestur and should it not accomplish that gestur make one more push a small push to the south so that russian railroad can be laid there and the train can run moscow to delhi moscow to kabul moscow to the indian ocean moscow to tehran moscow to baghdad moscow to ankara run day and night carri freight and peopl there and back and all in safe condit all for the economi for the develop of cultur we must exclud the possibl of the outbreak of war in this region exclud the threat of destruct of the region peopl bring them freedom and reliabl condit for develop the german want this they will agre today they themselv do not know what to do with 4 million turk and mani gypsi romanian czech and russian have recent been ad to that what are they to do with that number of foreign the german are return from russia to germani we are creat a crisi for germani fascist parti are spring up there again and we in russia are respons for this too if we make this southern dash we will stop the exodus of russian german to germani and we will promot the turk return home from germani we are prepar to accept turkish worker in our countri too some are alreadi work in moscow and other region so all our action with regard to the south are well thought out they have a geopolit nation and ideolog justif this could be assess as a discoveri by polit scienc with the aim of establish new condit in our region and exert a subsequ favor influenc on the entir world order all the world capit will understand us i have spoken about this with american french german japanes greek serb with mani peopl the finn again vyborg could be their it will be viipuri again they may have certain prioriti in karelia so there is reassur for northern europ germani will gain the opportun to reestablish east prussia on the basi of the territori of poland part of it and mayb take part of moravia from the czech republ and the german will be reassur and will never move eastward again and if we stop the flow of our german to germani and are even abl on the contrari to take from them some of their unemploy popul who cannot find an occup doctor architect engin in germani there is a shortag of manual worker but an excess of specialist they could be summon here to russia to the region of central asia for joint exploit of resourc space oil industri construct farm we would take back our german there are 2 million of them and take an addit 3 million or so it would be advantag to franc too we would help it to rid itself of the american and zionist influenc otherwis by the next centuri by the year 2000 the capit of franc will have turn into an arab citi becaus the algerian are surreptiti take over pari and go beyond that europ need our help a great histor mission has fallen to russia it may be it last after that it must go over to the resolut of pure nation task the develop of infrastructur the construct of good road storag facil cold store transport arteri communic network and new hous construct russia will in part becom a singl stori countri again with cottag sauna garag countri estat garden these are better condit for exist than these stone jungl and concret block it will be a good thing for india becaus the conflict with pakistan will end russia will acquir a border with india the conflict will ceas between mongolia and china china and southeast asia china and india japan will final defin it posit in term of it own nation interest there will be reassur for everyon south africa will have guarante of the exist of a white republ in southern africa but nobodi will help russia itself even america may turn out to need russia help the expans of spanish speaker from mexico and other latin countri in the north as publish of the unit state and the multipl of the black popul which could reach 40 50 million togeth this alreadi total around 100 million half of america will be color and in the longer term bear in mind that the color popul increas more rapid there will be a further growth of crime in america the destruct of the white popul and the simultan multipl of the color popul and who know whether america will not ask for a help hand from russia in the mid 21st centuri but russia must quick becom a healthi strong power state which must have ocean expans on it border the pacif ocean is not warm but it wash russia far eastern border then there is the longest border in the world with china that border should be calm onc and for all becaus china is orient toward the south not the north friend india and final the indian ocean and friend iraq and in the west those countri that will gain advantag romania might get someth say a littl piec of moldavia hungari could have a littl bit of romania and someth in transcarpathia the pole seem to be loser becaus they would like to have lvov but the west ukrainian republ need lvov and the german will crowd out the pole mayb there will be someth to suit poland in the region of volyn and brest we could resolv all these question for our western and eastern neighbor and the southeastern neighbor but onli on one condit first russia get what it need the same with trade first the good come to russia and then we make concess to our neighbor and onli after check the qualiti and quantiti of the good and prepay for russia to conced someth and for russia then to be let down we will not accept that the democrat russian accept that gorbachev and yeltsin made all kind of concess to the west the unit state the cia israel and what did they get in exchang noth noth they were let down neither the stavropol bear nor the ural bear know how to make a deal a differ kind of intellect is need here a differ kind of think is need here gorbachev was right there onli not the think of a kolkhoz member son the grandson of a stavropol kolkhoz chairman what is need here is a man who think on a cosmic scale at the veri least a planetari scale then a result could be achiev which will lead to a reason kind of exist and the implement of a geopolit formula to ensur the interest of the major on the planet and this is the formula we have spoken of in the page of our book it is crucial to the success of world polit at the end of the 20th centuri and we will enter the 21st centuri with new principl new view of world polit of the polici of region cooper we will ceas to make mutual accus we will ceas to demand compens for debt we must promot harmoni relat as in natur we do not want a burn sun but it is hard for us to be constant amid gloomi weather we do not want torrenti rain a light summer drizzl is enough we do not want snowstorm and hurrican a light snow fluffi and rapid melt is enough fewer polit disast rule out war let there be conflict between neighbor over whose goat or hog escap into someon els kitchen garden and ate up their swede but no ransom demand for the bodi of hostag seiz dure clash an end must be put to that situat forev just as russia onc put an end to the plagu cholera and tuberculosi but recent these diseas have reappear in some place becaus we fail to maintain the correct regim a hygien regim medic control correct nutrit for the popul we have let our hous fall into disord and diseas have begun to appear it is the same in polit minim conflict are possibl mayb over the rout of ship in the warm mediterranean sea mayb some fishermen will accident stray into someon territori water these disput are possibl but they will be resolv by arbitr the main thing is that the gun must be silent lethal shell must not rain down on our citizen head from abov it is sometim report in dispatch that women old men and children have been kill as if this is an aggrav circumst but is the death of young men a normal phenomenon the flower of the nation is die nobodi should die number have noth to do with it if a plane is shot down and onli the pilot die it is just as much a tragedi as if 50 100 or 200 peopl had die everyon life should be precious if 1 billion 100 million peopl live in china and 50 million die there will still be a great mani chines wherea if 6 million die in the czech republ there will be no czech republ left this approach is unaccept you cannot divid peopl and nation into great and not great we must move toward a civil societi we are all citizen of our planet we are all citizen of earth we are european asian african american we are russian we must live and act under the shelter of the law onli this can save us but we must take a final decis step we must establish new border and final share out sphere of influenc so that we have no clash of interst interest and that would not lead to war we must end all war at the end of the 20th centuri and enter the third millenium with onli minor privat conflict between individu citizen and the decis factor is in no circumst must a person nation be use as a discrimin factor so a civil societi so planetari think the safeguard of right for each and everi one freedom in everyth and for everyon but limit by a law that oper in time and space throughout our planet which could be a blossom and fragrant planet but could also becom a scorch desert with char remnant of tree and hous it all depend on us alon moscow and washington must realiz that you cannot wait ani longer you cannot experi you cannot dismemb russia becaus that mean the ruin of europ and of mankind we must put an end to interfer in the intern affair of other peopl and countri and share out sphere of influenc for the last time let russia success accomplish it last dash to the south i see russian soldier gather for this last southern campaign i see russian command offic in the headquart of russian divis and armi sketch the line of march of troop format and the end point of their

march infantri combat vehicl are advanc and vast number of tank are on the move russia is at last accomplish it final militari campaign war is exclud forev from the south for russia and in the north
