exist of 7 seven hepat virus infect man and strike his most import organ the liver the diseas aris in this case take mani form hepat cirrhosi and primari cancer of the liver it seem as if we can no longer amaz or frighten our peopl by anyth but this at the infect hospit the hepat and viral diseas depart those who wind up here can now recal with a doctor help how and where they becam infect i was work as a dental hygienist said an attract young woman an elder woman bitter recal undergo a cours of acupunctur a few month ago and then there was anoth a quit one in the corner of the ward who had recent visit israel as a guest and now let move on to the pediatr clinic the gastroenterolog depart children with a terribl diagnosi cirrhosi of the liver are treat here and most know that this diseas is the punish suffer by alcohol sometim it is hard for the doctor to figur out how this diseas came about the mother of an 11 year old boy her eye sunken from sleepless night no longer abl to shed tear explain the boy fell ill after a routin immun botkin diseas was the diagnosi he recov but he still feel poor sometim now the sentenc has been hand down a year and a half to live noth can be done the doctor are powerless now that the diseas has come into it own but could anyth have been done sooner yes that what this articl is about viral hepat is a diseas that occur extens throughout the entir world up to 250 000 case are regist annual in our countri these are onli the acut and obvious case of infect while in fact it is believ that this figur is underst by a factor of 10 perhap onli acut respiratori diseas afflict peopl more often and as for the number of fatal and complic there are no equal to this infect medic worker of the develop countri in which the fight against viral hepat has been rais to the rank of a state program came to understand this long ago reli on laboratori test medic worker can distinguish hepat today into type a the dirti hand diseas and type b so call serum hepat five other variant are not recogn by russian statist and they are classifi by a process of elimin as a mix group neither a nor b in russia hepat a is encount more often than the other type make up 60 70 percent of all hepat case in adult and 70 80 percent in children as with ani other intestin infect hepat a is typifi by season occurr and so it is now in fall that epidemiologist are note an increas in morbid especi among children attend nurseri school and schoolchildren mani probabl recal that gamma globulin immun use to be given against jaundic in time of mass outbreak today this is hard possibl it expens and the prepar is not avail in suffici quantiti how do we protect ourselv the advic is simpl wash your hand more frequent dont eat unwash food dont drink water from unfamiliar sourc and it would be better to boil all drink water and if you happen to make contact with a person who has the diseas be on guard for 5 week medic worker advis caution to tourist to develop countri of asia and africa this infect is extrem widespread there and most of the popul suffer the diseas in earli childhood western tourist make an effort to immun themselv against hepat a there is a specif vaccin alreadi and clinic test have proven it to be high effect such a prepar has also been develop in russia it studi has just begun and therefor we need to follow the rule that save the drown is a matter for the drown themselv and this is in fact possibl the scandinavian countri where the hepat a is an extrem rare phenomenon are an exampl of this isol case for everi 100 000 popul for comparison the figur is up to 100 in certain region of our countri at least anoth two type of hepat are transmit by dirti hand hepat e has now been studi suffici well this type occur most often in develop countri russian are absolut defenseless befor it and it cours is much more serious than that of hepat a vaccin against this infect are not even avail yet abroad and therefor the sole defens is to observ the rule of person and social hygien and now let talk about the form of hepat for which blood is the gateway in the earli 1960s the american scientist blamberg discov a characterist serum protein of hepat virus for which he was subsequ award the nobel prize sinc that time a real possibl has appear for doctor to distinguish between onli two type of hepat by blood test a and b detect of a protein antigen specif to hepat b in blood made it possibl to use this marker to determin the extent of blood infect modern test method are so sensit that they can detect a quantiti of virus of less than 1 gm in a billion trial this quantiti of virus by the way is fulli suffici to caus diseas for this the virus need to find the slightest break in the skin or mucous membran of the recipi enter the blood through it and then reach the liver with it flow the liver is the onli place in the human bodi where hepat b virus can multipli infect person react various to what happen in the liver as a result total differ cours appear virus carrier acut infect chronic hepat cirrhosi and cancer of the liver it is not at all necessari for jaundic to accompani acut hepat b medic worker note that the begin of diseas can recal the pattern of intestin infect and even ear nose and throat diseas especi among children the main thing is that the liver is enlarg which is someth you have to know how to detect a diagnosi as to precis what type of hepat is present can be establish onli after a number of special laboratori test to prevent infect of patient receiv transfus of blood plasma it prepar and compon all blood procur from donor must be test mandatorili such test have been conduct in our countri for 20 year alreadi but for some reason post transfus hepat continu to be a frequent phenomenon could it be becaus the blood servic has been use test of veri low sensit in develop countri where a veri serious effort has now been made for over 10 year to test blood for hepat b it proport in the structur of hepat after blood transfus has been reduc to 10 percent nineti percent of hepat is associ there with infect by yet anoth virus hepat c this virus resist detect for a long time and what is interest is that the test for this infect was develop befor the agent itself was describ in 1989 a check of donor in mani countri of the world reveal that a signific part of the world popul is afflict with hepat c what rais concern is the fact that presenc of infect can be judg onli indirect for the moment by reveal antibodi to the virus as for exampl in the case of aid and syphili which signific reduc the true number of infect individu today most develop and develop countri have introduc mandatori test of blood for hepat c into their blood servic this isnt as success of cours as in the case of hepat b nonetheless today this is the onli mean of prevent post transfus hepat c it may be said that blood is not yet be test for this infect in our countri if hepat is so widespread it is fulli logic to suppos that it is transmit not onli by donat blood but also by other pathway in fact hepat b is astound in the divers of the mean by which the bodi is infect children fate to be born from mother who are carrier of the infect or who contract the diseas dure pregnanc and not necessarili in it jaundic form fall into the risk group this is whi hepat b test of pregnant women is mandatori in mani countri hepat b is transmit sexual the virus is detect in sperm and in vagin secret a special risk group has been determin prostitut who are breed ground of infect unfortun there are few who know that hepat b is even categor as a vener diseas for this reason the slightest break in a partner mucous membran is enough for the virus to get into the blood these two pathway vertic from mother to child and horizont sexual perhap domin in various develop countri in which it is believ that over 20 percent of the popul is infect it has been note that entir famili may be infect with hepat b virus we know of one moscow famili in which a newborn infant contract the diseas in the hospit the mother was then infect from the child dure breast feed and final the father of the child manag to catch the diseas from the mother neither the sexual nor the vertic pathway of infect is typic of hepat c but as with hepat b this diseas is transmit through close person communic when the elementari rule of hygien are not observ virus may be transmit from one to anoth by share comb manicur and pedicur instrument and tattoo tool still the greatest percentag of infect occur in therapeut institut medic worker are especi at risk select test of medic personnel reveal particular hepat b marker five time more frequent that in donat blood sever case of acut hepat are note everi year in almost everi larg clinic in which case fatal have been known they have all been the result of job relat infect medic worker who come in contact with blood daili are at the greatest risk surgeon surgic and procedur nurs and specialist in procur and test the blood of donor and patient hepat b and c infect may spread within a hospit if diagnost and therapeut procedur that invad the skin and mucous membran are carri out with reusabl and poor clean instrument among patient those who receiv poor test blood on the basi of vital indic carri the greatest risk of fall ill this is well known to medic worker but they are powerless if materi support to the use of high qualiti blood test is insuffici are there realli no other way of stop hepat b and c besid blood test in 30 year of scientif research in this field some thing have alreadi been accomplish creation of a specif vaccin against hepat b is the greatest accomplish when scientist report this the press wrote triumphant that the first vaccin against cancer had been develop hepat b vaccin have been avail for over 12 year alreadi dure which time hundr of million of the planet inhabit have been immun it has been demonstr that the vaccin cours can provid defens against the virus for 7 or more year unfortun you cant get immun anywher in russia today either free of charg or for money the domest made prepar has not yet been perfect for practic use foreign prepar are not be purchas although western firm have alreadi been produc second generat vaccin that is absolut safe and effect for a long time medic worker and newborn infant from mother who are carrier of the virus are mandatorili immun in most develop countri but even where the epidemiolog situat is recogn to be unfavor there are sever such region in russia hepat b vaccin is includ on the calendar of children immun respond to a propos by the world health organ a number of african countri and itali have begun implement a program of expand immun of the popul it is disappoint to learn of such accomplish that are inaccess to russia this is whi moscow scientist and medic worker have join togeth to establish the hepat control assist fund a public organ bring togeth all who desir to join in the struggl use the resourc of modern accomplish in the epidemiolog prevent diagnosi and treatment of viral diseas of the liver the gap today between what has been accomplish through world progress in the area of hepat and what russian practic health has avail to it today is rather larg the fund has develop the anti hepat program and we invit all who wish to do so to work with us to carri it out the fund alreadi has a possibl for test donat blood in the way it is done in america and europ we also have hepat b vaccin in moscow we can be reach by telephon at

describ epidemiolog pattern of this infect breadth of spread distribut accord to sex age and social structur this enabl us to compar develop of the epidem process in russia to this process in other territori and to determin the distinct of it manifest the possibl of intramur spread of hiv infect was studi on the model of viral hepat b hbv for this purpos 63 hiv posit children and 162 children who had been in contact with the former in pediatr hospit and resid in kalmykia volgograd and rostov oblast were test for hbv marker children in one of the rayon of moscow oblast under clinic observ due to contact in a hospit with hiv infect children 122 serv as a control group hbv infect marker were demonstr by the method of enzym immunoassay use test system of the dia plus firm case of demonstr of hbsag were confirm in the conform test the first case of hiv infect in the republ were found in 1987 in 1988 there was a build up of hiv posit case main refer to adult in 1989 4 site of hiv infect were record in kalmykia volgograd and rostov oblast and stavropol kray which caus a dramat rise in number of hiv infect individu the natur of the site of hiv infect name detect of group involv in pediatr hospit caus predomin involv of children in 1990 the number of new case drop consider becaus of fewer case of detect of infect children at the abov site in 1988 the incid of hiv infect among adult doubl as compar to 1987 in 1989 and 1990 the same number of hiv posit case was found 68 peopl in each year in 1991 no trend toward rise was note which is indic of invalid of the forecast in all as of 1 januari 1992 there were 518 record case of hiv infect includ 266 children up to 14 year old the hiv posit case were record in 45 administr territori in 1991 6 new territori where onli adult were infect becam involv in the epidem process in 1990 there were 8 such territori this mean that there is rather broad spread of infect in the republ although the vast major of hiv infect individu resid in major citi of it european part the diagnosi of aid was made in 61 case includ 45 children there were 45 death includ 33 children as a rule 76 percent of adult aid victim expir within 1 2 and 3 year after the diagnosi is establish such rapid evolut of the diseas in adult is probablydu to late detect the ratio of hiv posit men to women constitut a mean of 15 1 rang from 6 1 to 1 7 in differ territori such fluctuat could be attribut to differ in social group involv in the infecti process analysi of the social structur of hiv infect adult reveal that most case 50 4 percent are refer to the so call high risk group individu who had sexual contact with hiv posit and aid case homosexu and bisexu those with vener diseas howev in 1991 there was a declin in their share to 38 9 percent versus 92 0 percent in 1988 there was an absolut and relat increas in share of hiv posit case screen becaus of pregnanc from 75 percent in 1988 to 46 2 percent in 1991 thus at the present time a consider part of those who are infect main women is detect by chanc we were impress by the fact that in all these year we fail to detect a singl case of hiv infect among drug addict or in the last 2 year among women who are promiscu we observ a rise in incid of hiv infect among individu test anonym and for clinic indic the dynam of age structur of adult infect with hiv have not chang there is preval of individu 20 44 year of age both in the total number and in differ year and they account for 94 4 percent of the case in the case of adult infect there is preval of the sexual rout of transmiss of the infect and there was the same incid of infect for both homosexu and heterosexu in differ region of interest are the case of hiv infect among adult in the southern part of the republ where larg site of hiv infect among children were form in 1989 adult constitut 12 percent of all hiv posit case found in this region and about half of the case were relat to the abov mention site in 1990 we found 20 hiv posit adult which constitut 30 percent of all hiv posit adult record in 1990 onli three of these case were relat to the site the total number of hiv infect case found is indic of activ of the epidem process in this region there the indic of hiv infect constitut a mean of 16 per 100 000 popul which is almost 23 time higher than the mean for the republ 07 100 000 the indic of hiv infect of the adult popul in the southern region is also high 02 100 000 and it equal or exceed the figur for territori where hiv infect is record main among adult in moscow this indic constitut 01 100 000 onli 15 percent of the case of hiv infect in the southern region appli to individu in the high risk group and this is 35 time lower than the mean for the republ at the same time 40 percent of the infect case are women who were test becaus of pregnanc this warrant the assumpt that individu in the high risk group and first of all those who are promiscu are hide under code 109 the high intens of hiv spread among adult warrant the belief that expressli they includ donor were the primari sourc of infect for children in the region of the site of those who are hiv posit 51 4 percent are children almost 87 percent of the child case were found as a result of screen contact at site of hiv infect infect of 23 children was establish on the basi of clinic indic 1 child was infect after receiv a blood transfus from an infect donor 14 children were born to hiv posit mother as compar to 1989 the frequenc of detect of infect children at the site diminish in 1990 and 1991 5 children were pick up in 1991 analysi of the age structur of the child case reveal predomin involv of the younger one more than 75 percent were children up to 3 year old we still are not clear as to the sourc and rout of spread of infect caus by hiv in children group unfortun as time pass the possibl of settl this question diminish the most popular opinion is that there was nosocomi infect in most such case howev by far not all of the case fit into this version in this regard it would be interest to investig the possibl and intens of nosocomi spread of hiv on the model of an infect that has the same rout of spread as hiv hbv infect could serv as such a model particular sinc the indic of hbv for the popul are consider higher than hiv infect the result of screen children who were not infect with hiv andresid in territori where site of hiv infect were record reveal a high incid of the infect caus by hbv the incid of detect of hbv infect marker constitut 29 0 percent which is 3 time higher than in the control group hbsag carrier were demonstr in 49 and 16 percent of the case investig of the result of screen children from volgograd oblast and kalmykia reveal that the child popul is more infect the indic of detect of hbv marker includ hbsag carrier among children from kalmykia were consider higher by 3 or more time than for children in volgograd oblast 43 9 percent versus 14 3 percent as well as 97 percent versus 29 percent respect the wide distribut of hbv infect among children in kalmykia warrant the assumpt that virtual all hiv infect children will be stricken by hbv howev the indic of infect with this pathogen did not differ among hiv infect and noninfect children the incid of detect of hbv infect marker constitut 50 0 and 43 9 percent respect at the same time among hiv posit children from volgograd oblast the frequenc of detect of hbv infect marker was reliabl higher than in children who were not hiv posit 75 percent versus 16 2 percent a substanti higher percentag of hbsag carrier was also found among them these find may be indic of nosocomi spread of hbv infect in rostov oblast onli 30 0 percent of the hiv posit children reveal marker indic of hbv infect and hbsag carrier constitut 47 percent at this site analog figur were obtain in an analysi of the result of screen children 3 5 year old who made up to main 77 8 percent group of hiv posit case and noninfect child contact and they character the actual situat thus hbv infect as a model of hiv infect make it possibl to demonstr differ in intens of the epidem process in differ site the low level of hbv infect among hiv posit children at the site in rostov oblast and absenc of differ in frequenc of demonstr of marker of hbv infect among hiv infect and noninfect children in kalmykia do not give us

recent for exampl specialist had to make an urgent trip to a certain eastern rayon of stavropol kray where the bodi of a man was discov in the stepp on territori that is epizoot in relat to plagu as it turn out the person had been wander and simpli froze but this doesnt mean that the trip and the inspect were unnecessari bykov but this is improb difficult monitor the situat on a territori commensur with the territori of certain european state yefremenko difficult it may be but our scientif research institut which is one of five russian region institut of this profil exist precis for the purpos of ensur epidem safeti that first and second you mustnt think that all of the work is done from here out of stavropol plagu station are oper in novorossiysk nalchik and makhachkala there is a branch network of plagu depart and special detach are work local bykov by the way vitaliy ivanovich whi are all of these subdivis includ the head institut call plagu institut dont you deal with other danger diseas as well yefremenko this is probabl done out of tradit in the past plagu was the most menac danger and in addit our institut develop out of a plagu station establish back in 1933 today we are in fact deal with cholera anthrax and brucellosi moreov life is forc us to join the fight against viral diseas such as influenza hepat and other it was for this purpos that the institut organ a virolog laboratori we provid what help we can to aid prevent center as well bykov in other word you are widen the front of the struggl against diseas so to speak but not onli are they not intend to retreat on the contrari they are gather strength what it worth talk about influenza if even newspap report about cholera or anthrax have ceas to be sensat yefremenko that all true but let think about whi this is happen on one hand there are an enorm number of peopl today who are not get complet balanc nutrit while some simpli dont get enough to eat add to this the present common known woe of our public health and the best possibl condit for growth of diseas becom obvious but there is anoth side as well i am refer to the atmospher of anarchi all permiss and lack of control reign in the countri sharpli intensifi the risk bykov can you pleas give an exampl yefremenko i can give you as mani as you want the danger of contract anthrax has alway exist it agent can surviv for a veri long time in what is known as it spore form and all you need is to have a rainstorm or a mud flow expos a livestock burial site befor a suffici depend barrier was maintain first by vaccin farm anim and second by inspect meat brought in for sale and process but now not onli privat owner but commerci farmer are econom on immun and meat could be sold right on the street without have undergon laboratori inspect this was approxim the scenario of the recent infect of a coupl of dozen peopl by anthrax in karachayevo cherkesia adyg khablskiy rayon bykov so what about cholera as far as i know it is brought to us from far away import so to speak yefremenko yes chiefli from asian countri pakistan syria india but even here we can observ disregard for elementari requir shortcut and other effort at econom go abroad our homemad businessmen whose number are now imposs to count depriv themselv of normal life food and drink in their race for profit just one swallow of infect water is all it take to bring cholera back to the homeland by the way despit their larg number muslim pilgrim for whom normal live condit are creat in saudi arabia have never brought us ani troubl bykov i heard a tragicom stori in your institut about two businessmen who had pick up cholera vibrio in foreign land escap from the hospit in krasnodar after chang their ident they didnt feel like lie around and so they left to make more money do peopl realli not understand that we are talk about a serious threat to both health and life itself yefremenko some dont understand other follow the old russian itll never happen to me philosophi but there are also those who are forc to risk their health and life due to circumst beyond their control i am refer to refuge who have flood our region poor depriv of all basic necess and at the same time activ move from place to place they are a sourc of special danger im not talk just about the diseas name abov in this case can we exclud for exampl outbreak of typhus if pediculosi has becom a common thing unfortun no bykov are you say that what we have here is a risk group in the flesh and what about the relat better off strata and categori of the popul who among them suffer more those live in the citi or in the countrysid or can you put the question this way yefremenko in general diseas doesnt ask you where you come from all the more so if you consid the densiti of the migrat flow the high mobil of the entir popul and the transpar of the border but if we consid the person or domest level then a herder work within a natur plagu focus risk more than an urban dweller though less than a careless poor equip tourist countri dweller probabl also have a greater risk of anthrax infect becaus they work with farm anim howev infect meat could be sold in the citi as well perhap the onli uncontest rural diseas is brucellosi rural inhabit should protect themselv from it especi care and not treat it as someth harmless a frighten diseas bykov doe your warn mean that save the drown is a task primarili of the drown themselv yefremenko there noth wrong with be extra cautious or with listen to the advic of specialist though of cours they may also label immun as a bad thing but then there no reason to be amaz that the number of case of let us say diphtheria is grow howev despit all of this prevent of danger diseas effici detect of sourc and foci treatment of patient and prevent of epidem are natur nation task and it is no accid that we are now develop a region program against especi danger infect encompass all of the south of russia we are also rais the question of organiz unifi the plagu servic with the sanitari epidemiolog servic but we like everyon els have mani problem bykov money yefremenko not just that although financ is one of the most pain issu consid what seem like a simpl thing an on site visit by our specialist this has becom simpli danger to life when it come to chechen ingushetia or northern ossetia nonetheless believ me we arent sit idl the institut doe have a rather consider potenti bykov can we talk a littl about someth els our interview has taken such a moros turn yefremenko well there isnt much to be happi about but as far as the institut is concern it would be hard of cours to describ it work in just a few word you would probabl be interest for exampl that an intern refer center of the world health organ work in the institut it has an extens data bank on plagu cover asian and a number of european countri there are also three other center a detect center a center for zoonos of the south of russia and a train center that prepar personnel for the cis our collect of flea plagu vector is second in import in the world the first be in england without go into the name of all of the divis and laboratori let me note that research is be conduct at a respect level in particular we are work on pharmaceut of a new generat that surmount the cellular barrier we have start product of diagnost materi base on magnosorb make it possibl to detect an infect sourc effici and precis in short no matter how danger diseas might be we are in no way defenseless against them bykov well let end on this note wish success to the peopl whose work is discuss in the paper far more rare than the outbreak of the frighten diseas they fight and health to all in our unfortun danger time", "score":

increas it market share despit competit from much larger and better financ player such as bentley laboratori a divis of baxter corp shiley inc a subsidiari of pfizer corp and sarn inc a subsidiari of 3 m one reason is that gish work hard to respond to the demand of the surgeon who are it princip custom said dr bradley harlan chief of cardio thorac surgeri at sutter memori hospit in sacramento harlan said that dure the 1970s when he had an idea for a devic for cool the heart dure surgeri thus reduc the risk of heart damag he took it to gish some of gish larger competitor he said either want him to sign over too mani of his right or were not interest he said but he was abl to strike a deal with gish moreov he said the compani made an import modif in the heart cooler that simplifi it and increas it market the product has been one of gish major seller i think they gish are veri respons to chang need harlan said so when an individu such as i come to them and express an idea for a new

disast the compani was found in 1976 by paul gic pronounc gish an entrepreneur who manufactur high qualiti product brown said but underpr them and spent extravag on corpor oper when brown arriv as

price and slash overhead he cut the staff to 28 from 55 and move to less spacious quarter it was a matter of surviv he recal brown said that when he took command of the compani he had to reassur

it first public offer of stock and bond to rais cash to satisfi numer creditor who were demand immedi payment the invest wasnt exact attract brown said in polit legales the prospectus said this is a junk bond gambl he said do not buy the stock unless you have money to lose nonetheless the offer rais 13 million the new fund also fuel gish effort to develop a broader product line start with one product plastic tube to support a blood oxygen system dure open heart surgeri gish has expand it line to 30 differ medic product each of which is offer in a varieti of model among the compani product success was the develop of a cylind shape reservoir to hold and filter blood shed by patient recuper from open heart surgeri so the blood can be recycl back to their bodi gish notic that hospit were increas concern about spread aid and other diseas through blood transfus so the compani adapt a blood reservoir that had been routin use dure surgeri so it also could be use in recoveri room in move

dure labor in which the umbil cord may becom squeez shut block off the infant blood suppli not all of the compani move have been winner brown confess that after he got gish into the ophthalm or eye laser busi in 1985 he made a seri of manag mistak that stunt the oper growth the experi taught him that a compani such as gish that is organ to sell dispos medic product doe not have the expertis to market larg piec of capit equip such as laser some analyst say one of gish weak is that it success depend too much on brown experi make it vulner if he were to leav in respons brown said that in the last two year he has been tri to increas the compani manag depth but brown admit that he has his fingerprint on everi part of gish and perform function that would be shun by most chief execut ive done everyth from plumb to repair the roof he said he recal that one saturday sever year ago when a hospit in los angel ran out of heart surgeri pack need for emerg he deliv some person that is custom servic and with a compani this size that what it take he said but be small also has the advantag of enabl gish to respond more quick to chang in custom demand than larger competitor he ad brown said gish greatest challeng is to continu to develop new special surgic product at a brisk pace anoth goal he said is to expand the compani market share in southern california where it is particular soft brown note that gish face especi intens competit in it back yard becaus orang counti is also home for sever other major cardiovascular compani such as bentley and shiley steven f crowley the secur

world health organ estim has to date afflict 12 million peopl in mani countri it is now one of the lead caus of death in mexico it was in fourth place in 1991 the cuban biotechnolog school battl

aid vaccin in a 62 000 squar meter facil near havana over 600 scientist most of whom are young produc 160 differ product 30 of them develop through genet engin it scientif staff has expertis in all of the modern methodolog necessari includ genet engin molecular biolog and immunolog and advanc biochemistri and it has the most advanc research and product hardwar in the world as reveal by an inspect tour of it lab and industri facil dr manuel limonta the director of the institut and of it scientif board state cuba will have an aid vaccin by 2000 or earlier he say they have a work group that is develop a vaccin against aid use genet engin technolog to prevent the diseas this is a strong group which has alreadi been work on this program for a long period of time and the group has produc signific result limonta did not describ these signific result but from other sourc we deduc that they have manag to isol and character the specif viral strain respons for hiv and that they are now in the laboratori test phase the cigb director express confid that they will manag to bring aid under control immunolog and state categor we are go to develop a vaccin dieterich steffan befor the french or american do limonta i do not know if it will happen befor but i believ it may be befor 2000 that is my person belief i think it may be earlier than that or it may be around that time that is my view of the matter if it were not dr limonta make this pronounc it might appear somewhat rash but limonta is a heavyweight in this field and his person achiev and those of the institut he direct lend author to his assert in support of this the director of the cnic nation center for scientif research dr carlo gutierrez say that limonta and his team practic live in their lab when they are tri to solv someth they are extraordinarili dedic to the work they are do and if they make such a statement they are capabl of do it he recal their achiev with interferon as an exampl when limonta work with a small team of young research propos produc interferon in cuba peopl were talk of a minimum time frame of three to four year they did it in 42 day a truli record time as everyon recogn on the lengthi list of the success of the cigb and it director mani achiev in close collabor with other cuban scientif institut there are near 160 differ product that have been develop by the cigb includ about 30 produc through genet engin from start to finish these are recombin product to convey an idea of what this mean dr limonta explain that in what is known as the third world cuba is the onli countri that has develop from start to finish product through the use of genet engin which are known and regist product and which are export such product have not been develop in ani of the other countri even in countri that are much larger than cuba like china or india just in 1993 the us patent and trademark offic in washington regist three patent for the cigb by so do it recogn the origin of the product and that cuba is the onli countri with the technolog and the methodolog to produc them it also recogn that the qualiti of these product meet the food and drug administr standard the most stringent in the world and grant cuba the exclus right to produc and sell these product in us territori for 17 year these product includ a prevent medic for myocardi infarct call estreptoquinasa regist as no 07 703 778 the first vaccin for mening bc develop anywher in the world 07 754 918 and the invertas sucros enzym which convert sugar into fructos for estreptoquinasa cuba with the except of one us firm is the onli countri that has produc this medic say limonta he explain that this product can dissolv clot in coronari arteri this medicin is capabl of elimin clot in a high percentag of patient when it is administ immedi after the infarct and it prevent the infarct from progress so it act as a prevent for myocardi infarct the patent registr for this product has alreadi been appli for in over 40 countri they are go to grant it for we know that we are the onli one who have develop an origin process to make this medic get a patent of this type reflect the high technolog capabl of our institut in this case the technolog is genet engin studi of the drug produc in the unit state have demonstr that it biolog effect is similar to that of the cuban product howev the cuban medic is much cheaper than the us drug estreptoquinasa was also develop in record time from the time when the idea was first conceiv until the product was regist as a medic onli four year elaps on the averag in cuba product are develop in less time than in us and japanes compani we have a studi done by us and japanes scientist that say that we are 13 time more product than they are in term of the time requir to complet a product and put it to use while compli with all the legal requir in practic this higher product coeffici may mean for exampl that a us or japanes product which requir 10 year for research and product may be develop in seven year in cuba the explan offer by the cuban scientist for such a surpris phenomenon is complex but they all agre that the educ and scientif philosophi of the revolut of which these young peopl are the result is the key factor anoth spectacular success of the cigb is what is known as nerv growth factor which is still not known elsewher in the world say limonta becaus nobodi els has been abl to develop it this medic a protein is use to regener nervous system damag and it could also be use in a diseas like alzheim the product has now enter the industri product phase which will enabl it to be use in clinic trial genet alter anim and plant anoth line of research the cigb is pursu is the genet modif of anim and plant to date they have produc transgen mice rabbit and fish their goal is now to produc a genet alter cow limonta explain that in these anim a new trait or genet inform is introduc in the fertil ovum which the anim assimil as it own and transmit hereditarili in this way genet chang can be produc and new speci can even be creat the specif object is to make mammal milk in this case cow milk also produc medic the cow is an excel milk produc laboratori if we can introduc in this laboratori the intellig enabl it in addit to milk to also produc specif protein then we could have for exampl interferon product in cow it all seem quit simpl we would not need a complex and cost industri interferon product process which requir the use of ferment equip close monitor etc the entir process would be done sole in the anim we would extract the product from the milk and the milk would then be use normal dieterich steffan that sound like scienc fiction limonta yes but it is go to happen i am absolut sure of it we have alreadi done it we have obtain medic in rabbit milk dieterich steffan do intern specialist know this limonta the one who read intern public do first we did this with mice to test the methodolog then we use rabbit to improv the methodolog and produc medic that was again success and now we are work to produc medic in larger anim in cow we have not done that yet but we are go to growth hormon manuel limonta also discuss the cigb progress in the control and use of growth hormon we have work on fish and in this area we realli have one of the most advanc group in the world we introduc the genet inform contain in the growth hormon in fish this caus the fish to grow veri rapid they do not reach a larger size than normal but they do so more quick becaus they incorpor their food better the time save can be half or an even larger percentag compar with the normal growth period the fish in this case tilapia a carp are still not reproduc in larg quantiti but the fundament step has been taken in the field of anim health they have creat for the first time anywher in the world a vaccin against cattl tick for which the patent is now be regist in brazil argentina mexico and other countri the develop of a vaccin against porcin colibacillosi a diseas whose mortal rate among newborn pig is 100 percent is anoth notabl scientif achiev at the present time a more advanc version of this vaccin is be develop in the area of plant health the use of biotechnolog has result in the increas of plant resist to specif pest a transgen tobacco has been produc which resist the manduca septa moth an insect that destroy the tobacco leaf with this genet modif the moth is kill without damag the leaf this is accomplish without alter the plant characterist a potato that is resist to one of the three type of virus that affect it seed is anoth cigb achiev they are now work to develop resist against the other two they have also produc a genet alter cabbag with a moth resist gene they have also develop a transgen sugarcan the first time in the world that a genet alter sugarcan has been develop to have a sugarcan that is more resist to some pest other achiev one of the cigb big achiev is the recombin vaccin against hepat b which is now use in over 20 countri in cuba it is given to all newborn as part of a nationwid program anoth complet new product now regist in cuba and some other countri but which is still not avail on the market is skin growth factor which is use to treat burn some other import product includ human monoclin antibodi for treatment and in the industri area new enzym one of these enzym is invertas sucros which transform sugar into fructos when fructos is use to sweeten or to improv flavor the amount of sugar need is reduc by 20 to 30 percent the method and technolog use for it industri applic are exclus cuban against aid on the second front against aid it diagnosi cuba has three differ techniqu the first was develop by the aid research laboratori the second by the cigb and the third by the cie immunoassay center in discuss the cigb techniqu dr limonta comment that uniqu diagnost method have been develop for exampl we have the aubio system in which a drop of blood deposit on a plastic strip react with a seri of genet engin compon we deposit on the plastic strip structur similar to the protein of the compon of the virus membran plus a gold base dye when the drop of blood come into contact with the plastic strip a chang in color is produc which indic simpli by sight whether the person has been infect this system has also been develop for use in diagnos toxoplasmosi hepat c etc and it use is now be expand to other ill it offer the advantag of not requir special equip to mix the blood and read the result and doe not even requir a technician or electr current as the result is visibl in ordinari natur light a differ method has been develop by the cie it has substanti improv the classic method of immunodiagnosi by reduc the amount of the blood sampl and reagent by 10 percent the efficaci of this diagnost method ultra micro elisa hiv has been demonstr in mani countri as well as in intern evalu by the aid refer center affili with the world health organ and paho pan american health organ for exampl in brazil canada and also in cuba itself now the cie is market an aid diagnost kit in mani countri which anyon can buy in drugstor the kit contain a paper filter a pipett to extract a blood sampl from the finger and a form the blood sampl is allow to dri on the filter the person select an anonym person code and list it on the form for exampl abc 345 and then send the dri blood sampl to a laboratori an autom reader like the cuban suma read the test and determin with a margin of accuraci of virtual 100 percent whether that person is hiv posit the person later call the laboratori give his anonym person code and receiv the result with absolut confidenti and privaci this system is now use in mani countri includ spain where it use has been approv by the ministri of health and consum affair the market price is on the averag between 20 and 30 percent less than the price of other product and the cie provid technic personnel and technic analyt or instrument assist as need this is veri conveni say the cie director of qualiti control dr rene robaina becaus when an institut like a blood bank need assist we are there we provid complet attent that includ everyth from the lab setup personnel train and later assist anoth advantag of this person aid diagnosi regist intern under the name of hipertest is that the paper filter contain the blood sampl can be sent by mail or messeng as it is high stabl onc it is dri it will last for month without the accuraci of the diagnosi be alter the hipertest is not sold in mexico but this could be done perfect well we simpli have to find a transfer mechan say robaina similar for exampl to what we have in the form of joint capit ventur in russia brazil colombia spain china ghana etc the test is produc exclus in the immunoassay center the filter paper which must have an extrem homogen qualiti is import from germani the chemic reagent also come from the world market while the biolog reagent are most produc in cuba the technolog is exclus cuban at the cnic medicin are be develop against diseas that occur becaus of the weaken of immunolog defens caus by aid we are work on medic to allevi aid we still cannot cure it say dr carlo gutierrez but we can tri to get rid of the other diseas we know there are medic that have slight lengthen the live of patient and we are tri to do that we are investig the possibl of a combin of those medic and we are now at a more advanc level than laboratori test from the laboratori we then go to bench test then to the pilot plant and final to the industri plant we are now at the bench test stage if we can produc this medic we could extend patient live more vaccin the finlay institut with an area of 23 000 squar meter unequal in latin america and one of the most modern in the world has 650 employe it develop the world first vaccin against mening and in 1990 it was award a gold model by the unit nation world intellectu properti organ for this achiev this vaccin was develop in bare five year the research had to work with live microorgan creat a high risk of infect as there is no other vaccin we took all possibl hygien precaut explain dr concepcion carma director of the institut and coordin of the research group that develop the vaccin but we had to work with larg volum of bacteria we are talk of kilogram of live bacteria that were grown in larg 300 liter ferment vat and that was a real risk the first volunt who use the vaccin were the research themselv becaus as a matter of ethic polici we believ that what we could not put in ourselv we could not ask anyon els to tri and when we test the vaccin in children we appli the same ethic standard our own children were the first one who use the vaccin onli later did we go to field test explain the doctor this vaccin is now be use in a number of latin american countri argentina chile colombia etc where mening is preval in brazil over 20 million dose have been administ without ani sever advers reaction be report in the cuban trial the vaccin demonstr an efficaci of 83 to 98 percent anoth import line of research is the anticholera vaccin which has alreadi undergon laboratori test with import result when the anim test is complet the three phase of trial with human be will begin follow by field test which will have to be done in some latin american countri as cuba is the onli countri in the hemispher where cholera doe not exist against myocardi infarct at the entri to the cnic in havana the visitor can read a statement by fidel castro the futur of our nation necessarili belong to men of scienc in this institut which is the leader and promot of cuban biotechnolog that quotat has becom a realiti as it major achiev attest among them is ppg policosanol which combat one of the princip risk factor for infarct high cholesterol level ppg which began to be market in august 1991 was develop from compon found in sugarcan whose solut have properti that reduc certain type of cholesterol at this time 200 000 cuban are use ppg regular and the result are posit in term of the patient physic psycholog and even sexual reaction the medic has now been approv for use in 12 countri and it patent applic is pend in 22 more countri each pill cost 1 and the minimum recommend dosag is one tablet a day other product whose action is similar to that of ppg the estatina mean unknown are from 15 to two time more expens they are also tri to extract from sugarcan the raw materi to produc phytosteroid in order to manufactur steroid hormon the basic element of anticontracept pill the cnic has develop the new product beyond the laboratori stage which includ test with anim and it is now in the pilot plant level anoth of the island natur resourc that is be use in biomedicin and biotechnolog is cuba coral reef sinc the cuban revolut has been care with the nation ecolog the coral are practic free from pollut dr gutierrez feel that the coral in human medicin are better than synthet materi becaus synthet materi introduc molecul that may be detriment to the human organ so at least in secondari aspect natur materi outperform artifici materi scientif studi have reveal that certain speci of coral are materi that can be use for transplant or graft due to their great biocompat with human bone tissu both becaus of their ideal architectur a porous structur that is tridimension interconnect and becaus of their physico mechan and biochem properti calcium phosphat ozon therapi a treatment develop by the cnic that is uniqu in the world is the use of ozon therapi in treat retin pigmentosa which if left untreat lead to blind with the use of ozon therapi the advanc of the diseas has been halt and patient sight has been improv we have been see patient for two year say dr gutierrez and they have not gotten wors but improv this has not been done anywher els in the world origin the equip that convert oxygen into ozon was import and cuban then develop innov applic for ozon for both therapeut and industri use at the cimeq medic and surgic research center ozon therapi is be use to dissolv compon of blood clot after five year of anim experi the treatment was appli to human be for coronari and cerebr diseas the techniqu is still in an experiment stage but it is now be use for arteri obstruct in the lower extrem as an altern to dilat or laser treatment the result have been present at intern confer in vienna pari brazil and uruguay anoth import line of research that the cnic is pursu is the use of monoclin antibodi for diagnos plant diseas for exampl there is a product that diagnos the tristeza babesia virus which attack citrus crop this diseas doe not exist in cuba but purchas of citrus fruit requir proof that the fruit doe not have this diseas by use this diagnost tool this is easi to demonstr medic equip for diagnos in clinic neurophysiolog of the central nervous system computer equip has been develop like the neuronica or medicid the neuronica is use to measur visual and auditori percept and brain wave dure sleep the medicid is veri use in analyz the nervous system and cerebr function cerebr map for exampl it provid a computer readout of electroencephalogram eeg and display the result on a monitor due to the us embargo cuban have produc all the comput program for this equip which is now in use in mexico the diram is anoth computer devic that provid a rapid microbiolog diagnosi in four hour it determin with reliabl the type of infect and it pattern of sensit to antibiot antibiogram a diagnosi that requir 72 hour when convent method are use by indic the most effect antibiot for a specif infect it avoid the develop of bacteri resist the ineffect use of antibiot and fatal outcom in serious infect becaus of the short analysi time the small volum that it requir and it low cost it is possibl to corrobor the result as often as may be desir anoth advantag of the system is that it can be use not onli for sampl of isol and purifi strain of bacteria but also for direct specimen from blood or urin cultur in first world countri equip with similar function doe exist but it is four to five time more expens the diram is faster and cheaper and cuba is now abl to export it the cie has develop the suma ultramocroanalyt system for the low cost analysi of laboratori sampl this is primarili use in the diagnosi of infecti diseas in blood bank in epidemiolog and for various health program the suma is the result of 18 year of research and the cie in havana the produc of the equip has suma laboratori in europ asia africa and latin america the equip is use to detect aid hepat b meningococcus alphafetoprotein etc in cuba the suma is use for the prenat diagnosi of virtual all pregnant women to detect congenit malform like neural tube defect and hypothyroid dengu and cholera the pedro kouri tropic medicin institut which is respons for protect the cuban popul from epidem of infecti diseas has kept ani infecti diseas from africa from spread in cuba despit the return home of ten of thousand of cuban soldier to do so high effici diagnost tool have been develop there is a diagnost system for dengu fever which is now in use in mani latin american countri report dr alina llop this rapid detect diagnost kit for antibodi is sold commerci as a kit and this is uniqu on the intern market similar kit have been develop to detect streptococcus group b which provid result in three hour in addit analys of mening infect and cholera which with convent method take no less than four day can be obtain in eight hour with the new cuban molecular biolog diagnost system cuba is probabl the onli countri in latin america that has these system anoth system of great import for the third world is a new diagnost tool for amebiasi which base on molecular biolog has a 100 percent accuraci rate this obvious elimin the uncertainti inher in convent method there are also other biomed and bioscientif area for exampl the develop of comput for medic imag in which cuba is one of the world leader young scientist the key factor that explain in the wide held opinion of the director interview the spectacular advanc of the cuban biotechnolog school is the prioriti that has been given sinc 1959 to educ and public health thank to which they now have a critic mass of young scientist of high qualiti creativ and disciplin the human factor is actual the onli element that differenti the cuban biotechnolog school from advanc laboratori in the unit state europ and japan all high tech laboratori use the same technolog equip which explain whi a visitor who enter the technolog facil of the cuban research and product center will find the same type of swiss bioreactor huge japanes electron microscop german tomograph equip and french mass spectromet that their first world counterpart have and the same thing is true for the chemic and biolog raw materi that are not produc in cuba the polit determin of the cuban state the effici network of cooper between research and product institut the unusu combin of basic and appli research as well as the strong insist that the product must meet intern standard of qualiti are all factor that have contribut to this success becaus of the us embargo cuban scientif institut have necessarili had to work with european and japanes multin with us corpor remain outsid the commerci develop of this enorm cuban potenti howev it is probabl that the us busi elit will not toler this exclus for much longer instead it will probabl opt as it did with vietnam to cooper with cuban biotechnolog and that will be the raison detr for put an end to the embargo cuba continu emerg from isol throughout latin america and europ the reconcili with the miami exil and the extraordinari intern reform are all lead in the same direct so if the cohes of the cuban model can resist for the next two or three year cuba will becom with the except of costa rica the onli latin american nation project with solid foundat enabl it to leav underdevelop behind and emerg from the

is revis the definit of advers experi in this final rule by delet the word signific the agenc is retain the propos languag in the definit of advers experi instead of adopt the suggest to requir report onli of chang in failur rate becaus a chang in failur rate can onli be determin retrospect a chang in failur rate is to be report in an increas frequenc report howev a failur of expect pharmacolog action that caus a serious and unexpect advers experi in human should be report within 15 day regardless of the rate of such report the agenc believ that the exampl given may or may not indic a failur of expect pharmacolog action for exampl patient with congest heart failur often have irrepar kidney damag which even the most potent diuret cannot overcom in such a situat congest heart failur would

comment suggest that the analysi is not of the increas frequenc of advers experi but rather the analysi is of the increas frequenc of report of advers experi one comment request that the agenc develop improv method for determin increas frequenc that would account for fluctuat in report fda agre that increas frequenc of advers experi report doe not necessarili correl with an increas in advers experi case report are use to alert the agenc about area which may need further investig fda take into account the fact that report rate vari over time in postmarket surveil when analyz the report rate for

the number rose to 782 peopl and in the first eight month of this year 557 peopl have receiv rabi vaccin after be bitten by a dog what is worrisom is that lao has alway use a vaccin produc from anim

which strike about 3 million american each year can be fatal general pneumonia is well understood by doctor and is easili treat with a varieti of antibiot said dr bisher akil an expert in infecti diseas and pulmonari medicin at the univers of southern california you get simpl outpati treatment with antibiot and you get over it akil said in healthi peopl it not a problem unless you ignor it and let it escal but pneumonia is fatal for an estim 70 000 american each year rank as the sixth lead caus of death accord to the american lung assn most of the death occur among the elder infant and peopl with ill such as cancer or diabet all of whom have weak immun system and may be unabl to fight off infect in other case death can occur if treatment begin too late as was appar the case with henson or becaus the particular strain of pneumonia is difficult to identifi as in the case of actress elizabeth taylor brush with death from pneumonia last month expert said pneumonia is an infect of lung tissu and is classifi accord to it caus and it locat in the lung akil said the diseas is most common caus by bacteria such as the streptococcus bacteria that kill henson it is also caus by viral infect such as influenza in rarer instanc pneumonia is caus by fungi parasit chemic agent or allerg reaction to foreign particl that lodg in the lung streptococcus a bacterium found in the mouth is the lead caus of pneumonia and is fatal in about 5 of case usual in peopl with weaken immun system expert said henson appar die from a strain call group a streptococcus which offici at the center for diseas control in atlanta said is increas in frequenc for reason that are unclear group a streptococcus is fatal in 20 to 30 of case the cdc report but the 53 year old creator of the muppet appar did not seek treatment in time to arrest his rapid spread infect said dr david m gelmont director of intens care at new york hospit where henson die earli wednesday accord to gelmont henson was examin by a physician in north carolina on may 12 after develop flu like symptom but pneumonia was not diagnos henson report return to new york on monday and die less than 24 hour after be admit to new york hospit when he enter the emerg room at 4 58 am tuesday henson was die of massiv infect and acut respiratori distress offici said he receiv larg dose of antibiot and was place on a ventil physician estim that the overwhelm infect had been progress for at least three day and said antibiot were ineffect at that point the pneumonia was not detect by the doctor in north carolina but by no mean did someon blow the diagnosi gelmont said he did not have the textbook symptom of pneumonia he did not have a fever or sputum he did have a mild cough symptom of pneumonia can vari accord to it type four major symptom common to streptococcus are fever chest pain cough and short of breath akil said bacteri pneumonia is usual accompani by a discharg of sputum sometim blood ting from the lung viral pneumonia often produc a dri cough pneumonia common trigger a particular kind of chill a sever trembl of the bodi call a rigor said dr elli goldstein chief of infecti diseas at st john hospit and health center in santa monica where taylor is recov from the autopsi and from a physic examin it is appar that mr henson was a healthi man gelmont said he was so healthi he didnt have a regular physician the problem was he continu to feel wors over the weekend by sunday i think he should have seen a doctor certain by monday when he was short of breath but im sure he thought he could shake it off by the time henson was admit to the hospit the infect in his lung had alreadi migrat throughout his bodi and had begun to caus failur of his kidney heart and blood clot abil pneumonia can be imposs to arrest after abscess form in the lung and then spread through the bloodstream to differ organ in the bodi expert said despit all of the antibiot and modern techniqu we possess patient do die in hospit becaus of rapid spread pneumonia when they are not admit until after the ill has reach the critic stage said dr david b skinner presid of new york hospit befor the advent of antibiot pneumonia was call the captain of the men of death becaus it common caus death among the elder goldstein said even befor antibiot came into use howev healthi young peopl usual manag to fight off the diseas antibiot dont actual kill the bacteria caus pneumonia they allow the bodi to mount it own natur defens said goldstein thus the serious of the ill vari accord to the strength of an individu defens if the agent caus the pneumonia can be identifi the particular antibiot that will be most effect is prescrib akil said if a caus is not immedi appar doctor must tri various drug and perform laboratori test of lung sputum or lung tissu with viral pneumonia which may not produc sputum from the lung that can be use to identifi the virus doctor sometim remov a piec of lung tissu to test to make a diagnosi the problem with viral pneumonia is that our abil to identifi the virus is not good akil said most of the time the diagnosi is one of exclus but what happen with elizabeth taylor is that they had to go with open lung biopsi becaus they couldnt find a reason they had to take a big piec of lung tissu and look at it taylor 58 was near death with viral pneumonia when doctor perform a lung biopsi to identifi which antibiot would best assist her antivir drug have been develop that are effect in treat some viral pneumonia taylor enter daniel freeman marina hospit april 10 with a sinus infect the infect progress to pneumonia and the actress was transfer to st john april 16 taylor pneumonia most like develop from a virus in her bloodstream but peopl can get pneumonia from differ kind of exposur akil said one is when you swallow saliva and normal bacteria and it doesnt go to the stomach it goe to the lung he said we do that all time as long as our immun system is intact it take care of the bacteria we accid inhal into our lung onc the immun system is weaken whamo you get pneumonia the diseas can also enter the bloodstream from a cut for exampl and can travel to the lung or the offend agent can be inhal as was the case with legionnair diseas which is caus by legionella bacteria and spread through the air usual from a contamin air condit system or water system legionella bacteria were recogn as a caus of pneumonia after 29 peopl die after an american legion convent in philadelphia in 1976 pneumonia can also develop as a complic of anoth ill such as the

medeva share price had halv to 150p though it has subsequ bounc to 175p and it market capitalis had fallen to just over pound 330m acquisit back by the issu of share have been put on the back burner and the compani is be forc to prove earlier than expect that it can generat the organ growth it has promis medeva manag led by mr bernard taylor former chief execut of glaxo and mr ian gowri smith a success australian financi engin has consist follow a neat and compel game plan in their first two year they began buy compani and matur drug portfolio from larg group such as wellcom with the chunkiest acquisit financ by the issu of high rate share becaus the asset medeva acquir were on much lower rate each acquisit automat enhanc earn even befor the benefit of ani oper synergi at the same time medeva has been look for compani that would push it into intern market and final it has start it own develop effort by acquir drug that other compani have taken close to the registr stage while this plan has not chang the market has clear had second thought us disenchant with the health care sector is part to blame as the fall in the number of share held in american depositari receipt form suggest and a self fulfil downward spin may have develop investor who were look for headi acquisit driven growth may have sold as it becam increas unlik that medeva would issu paper as it share fell more serious howev sceptic say medeva may be an echo of some raci 1980s compani that ground to a halt when they were no longer abl to maintain their high rate the spotlight is therefor firm fix on medeva interim result in septemb when investor will get a better pictur of organ growth from the 10 acquisit to date mr taylor accept that the share price fall has temporarili rule out the issu of paper and that this will limit the pace and size of acquisit but it will onli slow rather than halt the transit to a viabl medium size pharmaceut compani within the next three to four year the chief execut say to reach that critic mass sale of about pound 500m compar with pound 82m last year mr taylor say medeva probabl need to add two or three more product area to it vaccin pain manag and respiratori product busi it also need to expand intern particular in the us which is like to be it largest market as it has decid not to tri to break into japan germani franc and itali the like rout will be to buy small compani with sale forc it will also need to buy more develop product that are in the late stage of clinic develop like the hepat b technolog bought in march but with new share issu temporarili rule out and the compani uncomfort about higher gear after it bought intern medic system of the us larg for debt in june cash from oper becom medeva main sourc of acquisit financ there is a prolong of risk say mr taylor but it doe not mean medeva has run into the buffer investor he say have focus too much on the group acquisit and not enough on it organ growth potenti and the qualiti of it pharmaceut manag what we have to do is show that we are build a pharmaceut compani through acquisit we are not acquir compani that happen to be pharmaceut compani he say perhap it is not recognis that the major of our director are the salt of the pharmaceut earth one obvious blot on the medeva copybook is it involv in unbrand generic drug a fierc competit busi which still account for a larg though decreas percentag of sale but analyst are also wari about the qualiti of earn from unbrand generic a part of medeva mr taylor doe want to remain in long term not that forecast of pre tax profit have chang veri much between the peak of medeva share price in march and the recent low pre tax profit forecast rang at about pound 36m for the year to decemb more than doubl that of 1991 becaus of the effect of acquisit but there is a debat about what sort of rate you should give to a stock like this say one sector analyst medeva purchas of a rang of smaller and older drug which are not follow as close as blockbust such as zantac mean investor have to take much more about it market on trust from the compani it get harder to extrapol how much secur of earn you have got in there the broker say septemb interim may hold some of the answer and a sharp share price recoveri would re open the market for new issu but until medeva has attain a greater critic mass investor must be

medicin is a result of genet engin i am take this opportun to tell you that part of the medicin we current export to colombia is destin to pay some old debt that are still pend we intend to honor our commit and pay some debt this way i believ the possibl are mani becaus you have a larg popul 30 million or more than 30 million the moder say 33 million castro exclaim how you have grown you were half that mani a few year ago you also have differ climat tropic temper and your is one of the countri most concern about peopl health let me tell you the recent colombian govern have been most concern

time i sat down read some paper and chat for awhil and sudden we were land here the communic revolut has brought us closer we are veri similar at least we are quit similar to the peopl in cartagena de india perhap becaus we live in a warmer more tropic climat mayb the peopl in santa fe de bogota are not so communic becaus they live on a plateau and it is colder over there it is colder there and i am told the citi has grown so much and there is so much cement that it is now like mexico citi where the averag temperatur has increas we are veri much alik howev and it is a truli promis step to

direct to the consum without prescript the link up in over the counter otc drug between three of the world big drug group while the most ambiti to date is unlik to be the last the most obvious effect of the industri shift in strategi is to transfer power from the scientist to the market man in term of prescript drug warner lambert is much the weakest of the three compani but it is a giant in us consum market it advertis budget is the 11th largest in the us support product such as listerin mouth wash and benylin cough syrup it also has a 600 strong us sale forc and otc sale around the world of dollar 2bn wellcom has otc sale of dollar 400m and sell most through broker glaxo has no otc product and no sale forc it is therefor warner lambert which domin the joint ventur this is despit the fact that by common consent of the parti the chief attract of the deal lie in forthcom otc product from glaxo and wellcom glaxo zantac an ulcer treatment is the biggest sell prescript drug in the world zovirax wellcom anti viral treatment is the eighth biggest the aim is to sell zantac as an indigest pill and zovirax as a cream for cold sore or in the us as a pill for genit herp mr john robb wellcom chief execut explain the logic yesterday the differ between the econom of prescript drug and otc medicin is that in prescript drug your big cost come befor you reach the market with an otc product it the other way round the market cost in year one can be as big as your revenu and it can take seven or eight year to get your pay out therefor said mr robb the trick is to build up consum awar of the drug in it last year on prescript that way it has a fli start when it is convert to otc wellcom claim to have done this with it cough medicin actif and sudaf and to be do it now with zovirax inde all but one of the top 15 otc medicin launch in the us sinc 1975 have been former prescript drug but it need the market muscl of a warner lambert to hustl them along with their oper behind us mr robb said were like to get a much faster lift off and better penetr with zovirax than we would do through a hand of broker and warner lambert can buy advertis much more cheapli and get more shelf space sinc mr robb is himself a consum market man by train it is hard to believ he doe not chafe at be junior partner in the ventur but he treat the fact stoical i couldnt see ani other way into it we are just not in the first flight of consum market compani and it would take a huge invest to get there there is no one you could think of make a hostil bid for and no pharmaceut compani want to sell it otc busi and as otc approv for zovirax start come through we risk miss the market opportun when it come to glaxo the motiv is more complex it negoti with warner lambert began independ from wellcom it strategi was also veri differ inde strateg differ within glaxo may have contribut to the abrupt and somewhat mysteri departur in march of dr ernest mario glaxo chief execut it was rumour at the time that dr mario want to pursu outright merger with warner lambert howev glaxo chairman sir paul girolami remain a stubborn advoc of the virtu of prescript medicin yesterday deal mean that glaxo will wash it hand of the otc futur of zantac and it other drug leav their develop to warner lambert and wellcom dr franz humer glaxo chief oper director yesterday stuck to the glaxo line it would be wrong to blame dr mario departur on differ over the deal he said the reason for his departur were mani and vari we are convinc that the prescript drug market will continu to be a veri healthi and grow one he said we want to concentr all our resourc and the pound 700m we spend on research and develop on innov ethic ie prescript pharmaceut this deal clear recognis that the know how for run an otc busi belong to warner lambert warner lambert itself is in no doubt of the valu of it catch mr mel good the chairman was clear in a jubil mood as he announc the deal yesterday while he refus to estim the incom that would flow to his compani from the agreement he said in aggreg they have the potenti of ad hundr of million of dollar to our annual sale line the compani claim that a treatment for genit herp which is avail for immedi purchas from a pharmacist would elimin thousand of doctor visit and give suffer access to the product at an earli stage when it is most effect this would make the switch of the product to otc status attract as govern look to curb their health care bill said mr john walsh head of the compani consum product divis while the new joint ventur will still rank onli third in the world of otc product behind johnson johnson and american home product it tie in with the strategi of extend the rang of product sold through warner lambert exist network as enunci by mr good soon after he becam chairman two year ago on the other hand zantac and zovirax are unlik to be on sale in the us befor 1996 at the earliest accord to warner lambert yesterday a submiss will be made to the us food and drug administr in august to sell otc version of both product with approv expect in 1994 or 1995 it might also be ask how profit they will be despit zantac huge success as the world biggest prescript drug when it come to the otc market it will be enter a crowd field smithklin beecham tagamet an older ulcer drug with an almost ident action has alreadi been clear for otc sale in the uk and has been submit for clearanc in the us a third drug with a similar action pepcid has been submit for otc approv in the us by merck the biggest prescript drug compani in the world accord to mr robb of wellcom us margin on otc medicin are good by consum product standard though not by comparison with prescript drug they shouldnt drop below 15 per cent befor tax he said yesterday it would also be unusu if they went abov 20 per cent that veri respect and who know where prescript drug margin are go to go i suspect theyll be more under attack than the otc side howev past otc margin need not be a guid to the futur it is worth recal that as recent as the late 1980s drug compani thought the answer to govern pressur on price was to merg their prescript busi as smithklin did with beecham and bristol myer did with squibb now the trend is to get togeth with consum group thus the pharmaceut group syntex has alreadi form a market allianc with the consum product giant procter gambl

that of ani other anim the discoveri is consid a tantal clue to the evolut and work of the mammalian immun system a better understand of which could ultim benefit those work to combat various immun system disord in human but the work also promis insight into the evolutionari process in general and a better explan of whi shark seem to have unusu resist to a number of diseas includ cancer this latter fact has been known for more than 25 year and continu to be the subject of a few isol long term research effort aim at develop a treatment for human cancer the recent immun system studi were done at sever marin laboratori in florida and new york where research are work with shark skate and ray all of which occupi the same taxonom subclass call elasmobranch compar to the immun system of mammal and bird which have receiv the most scrutini so far the elasmobranch immun system appear primit but remark effect and high adapt to it environ accord to michael sigel who did pioneer work on the shark immun system at the univers of miami in the 1960s immun seem to be much more effect in the shark than in man hors or other mammal said sigel now chairman emeritus of the depart of microbiolog and immunolog at the univers of south carolina medic school a proper work immun system keep it host aliv by combat diseas and infect it doe this by identifi antigen potenti harm foreign substanc main protein in the bodi and mount an attack against them in human and other mammal a two part system has evolv one part call the cell mediat respons or t cell immun elimin cell with antigen on their surfac a virus infect cell for exampl has viral protein a form of antigen on it surfac which initi a cell mediat respons the other part of the immun system is the humor antibodi respons or b cell immun which deal direct with antigen by releas antibodi into the blood these antibodi are other kind of protein that attach themselv to the antigen either destroy it direct or enabl other cell to destroy it by ingest in human there are million of possibl antibodi which fall within five class known as immunoglobulin in the mid 1960s sigel found that shark have a peculiar immunoglobulin molecul call igm that offer unusu versatil protect sigel later found that a larg amount of the igm is alway circul in shark and readi to act it alway seem readi to attack anyth in sight sigel said in human on the other hand the immun system is normal dormant turn itself on in respons to antigen nonetheless in the igm discoveri sigel establish an interest link between human and shark human fetus have most igm immunoglobulin at first and begin produc the other form later on sigel interpret this coincid as an exampl of ontogeni recapitul phylogeni or the develop of an individu organ reflect evolut itself biologist believ that through evolut the human immun system becam complex and extrem flexibl in order to cope with the huge number of differ antigen that it must respond to everi one of these antigen prompt a differ set of antibodi so b cell immun depend on a fabul divers of antibodi in virtual all anim the veri first wave of antibodi that respond to an antigen is igm but dure this first respons some antibodi undergo a mutat that refin and improv the way they bind to that particular antigen the next time the immun system encount the antigen it mount a quicker and more effect attack base on a higher class of antibodi call igg or iga but sinc shark cannot make these higher antibodi they never experi an improv or memor second immun respons multipl exposur to the same antigen mere produc essenti the same respons over and over again in the earli 1980s after the role of genet in the mammalian immun system was uncov gari w litman and kristin r hind at the sloan ketter institut for cancer research in rye ny began explor the antibodi gene system of the horn shark which is found main in the pacif off southern california the evolutionari line includ shark diverg from the line extend to mammal as mani as 450 million year ago and litman and hind were look for clue to the immun system that exist at the time of that diverg what they found exceed expect at everi twist and turn of evolut we have document evid in this laboratori that there were sometim major differ in the way that antibodi gene were organ and function said litman now at the univers of south florida in a recent interview that came veri much to our surpris for exampl shark do not have near the varieti of gene segment that human have so their immun system is less flexibl litman say he and hind have found some evid in shark of antibodi mutat but it is not at all like the mammalian process that lay the foundat for a much improv secondari respons to an antigen to litman the shark immun system is evid that evolut doesnt alway work in a continu way to improv at some departur a type or form may appear that doesnt have to work anywher els in evolut the shark system he note is less sophist than man but perhap it leav less to chanc mayb it stay less complic becaus it doesnt need capabl like those of a higher land bound system litman theori is support by past find that the shark immun system seem to do an extraordinari job of protect against cancer and other diseas more recent research in this area has focus on the abil of shark cartilag to inhibit tumor growth tumor need a larg blood suppli to surviv and it has been known for year that cartilag of all kind whether from mammal or fish has no blood vessel and inde contain substanc that prevent the format of new blood vessel for studi of this phenomenon the shark is the ideal laboratori anim it is cartilagin from head to tail without a bone in it bodi carl a luer a senior scientist at mote marin laboratori in sarasota fla has been work in this area sinc 1979 have shown that a group of protein from shark cartilag doe in fact inhibit blood vessel growth luer is now tri to isol the specif protein involv and compar their effect with protein from mammalian cartilag in the last year he narrow the group of protein from eight to three his long term goal is to identifi in these protein one or more activ molecul that might lead to a

protect from inadequ test drug that could compound their problem scientist caution i dont think anybodi want to do ani harm to patient for the greater good of scienc but the greater good of scienc is

potenti fatal diseas are concern the regul are far more inclin to move quick and to seek way for critic ill patient to obtain drug that are promis but not yet thorough test this will go to cancer and to alzheim and to parkinson there no question about it said david rothman professor of social medicin at columbia colleg of physician and surgeon the aid communiti has been the shock troop of chang as the notion of consum right advanc in aid it will inevit be pick up by those with other diseas lost sight of need mani member of the medic communiti believ the regulatori system has been so focus about produc scientif valid inform about new drug that it has lost sight of patient need for quick help patient with critic diseas they say should have the right to decid whether to gambl on a drug that show earli promis mani drug will be releas with less knowledg rothman said but if you were a patient face a termin ill wouldnt you want the ultim right to make choic of risk and benefit my answer would be absolut rothman acknowledg that the consequ might be some delay in gather scientif data about the impact of some drug but in all human experiment there is alway conflict between the interest of the particular patient and the research communiti and outsid societi he said delay may ultim benefit all futur patient but not this particular patient at this particular moment but should this particular patient be requir to sacrific his interest for the larger social good frustrat suffer dr jerom groopman an aid research at new england deaco hospit still see patient one day a week and he said that he understand their frustrat and suffer it make you step back and say if this were my son id go to the end of the earth to make sure he got someth that could help him groopman said but if we total demolish the scientif system well never learn what we need to learn about drug and how to use them there got to be a balanc befor aid the balanc was too far in the other direct it was so restrict that peopl couldnt get ani access drug manufactur impati with the pace of the old system support the new philosophi although they acknowledg that the chang may bring some new problem liabil

process in principl he quick ad i think most peopl agre that wed all like to get life save drug through the process as quick as possibl acceler the trend if aid activist have speed up the process they have mere acceler a trend that had been under way befor when dr frank young becam fda commission in 1984 he said ive been through the experi of liter have patient die befor my eye while theyr wait for

disast in this countri has guid feder regul ever sinc until aid came along now the nightmar case is no longer thalidomid rothman said it is that of a young man die of a fatal diseas in a pain wast and

began read some of the document written by the act up peopl they were surpris articul and well inform after meet with the protest fauci talk with the fdas young his intervent help speed the fdas decis to releas ganciclovir network of activist rothman doubt that such a radic shift in regulatori approach could have been achiev by cancer patient or ani group suffer from ani other termin ill most aid activist he said are alreadi part of a larg polit base through the gay right movement there was no network of cancer patient rothman said they are unit onli by their diseas with aid you have a communiti alreadi unit this is the first time youv got an organ in medicin lobbi this way on a diseas in which the organ preced the diseas befor aid experiment drug even for invari fatal diseas were avail to the public onli through limit and high structur clinic trial that compar their effect to those of medic inact placebo or other drug these studi often took year to complet and mani patient could not particip becaus they did not qualifi or have access to them onli after these painstak studi establish a drug as both safe and effect could other peopl take it mani regul and research had long argu that such lengthi scrutini was necessari to achiev scientif certainti and to ensur that danger or worthless drug did not prolifer now feder regul have begun to relax the process a new feder sponsor program of communiti base research effort will allow local physician and facil to particip at the grass root level in various aspect of aid research parallel track research beyond that in the most controversi of the innov now under way fauci has propos a parallel research track that would allow new and unprov drug to be use by aid patient even while tradit clinic trial were go ahead the onli person allow to take such drug on the parallel track would be those inelig for the formal high structur clinic trial aid activist and other believ that parallel track drug trial ultim will prove

critic of the fda predict that the parallel track if it work for aid will be use in other equal life threaten circumst the onli circumst where you should be will to take such risk when your realli up against the wall but some research fear that the parallel track the most radic departur from past practic goe too far earli access to experiment drug they warn could subject individu to addit suffer and even divert them from potenti more benefici treatment chemotherapi and radiat for cancer for exampl and with the drug azt show promis even aid patient might be take a bad risk by tri unproven altern the skeptic cite the exampl of laetril a drug that lure mani cancer patient to mexico and elsewher when the fda refus to make it avail in the unit state the drug a deriv of apricot pit ultim prove worthless if they give away the store we can all worri said an academ physician and longtim advis to the fda who ask not to be identifi if we loosen this up too much then well be like some part of the rest of the world where drug regul vari between less rigor than desir and abysm safeti efficaci judgment the fdas young and other insist that even under parallel track drug will not be releas

worri about quack remedi ad petricciani of the pharmaceut manufactur assn you will still have fda in the loop make judgment about safeti and efficaci i dont think there will be room for mischief not everyon is so sanguin a former fda advis and longtim observ of the drug approv process said that mani drug have been approv for sale to the public in recent year onli to be shown later to caus serious problem oraflex which was wide hail at the outset as an arthriti medic that was better than aspirin with fewer side effect was approv by the fda in 1982 it was later remov from the market after it use was associ with at least 49 death in this countri and sever hundr death abroad and that with the most care regul the former fda advis said onc you move away from that the likelihood of more move way up serious reserv some research who are conduct control clinic aid trial favor the parallel track in theori but have serious reserv about whether it will work in practic they fear that if the parallel track experi are not care monitor the result could be disastr they point to sever recent instanc in which promis aid drug have appear safe in earli human test but prove more toxic after be given to larger number of peopl they are also concern about potenti problem caus by drug interact we can argu veri strong that if a drug look safe and can be given in a safe set the drug should be offer to patient with aid as earli as possibl said harvard schooley but if these drug are administ by peopl who arent experienc in look for unexpect side effect were like to caus more harm to peopl who could otherwis be take drug we know a lot more about like azt mani research also worri that parallel track may jeopard tradit clinic trial for aid drug becaus individu will simpli refus to particip or potenti particip may find some way of becom inelig for the formal trial becaus they want the certainti of receiv the experiment drug instrument of compass the cancer institut broder call the parallel track an instrument of compass that is design to meet human need what it is not he warn is a scientif instrument or a way of do a clinic trial it purpos he said is to not leav peopl total out on a limb without anyth and to make sure patient do not feel disenfranchis and isol those are legitim goal and i support them but parallel track cannot be use as a substitut for clinic trial or as a vehicl for advanc the more rapid develop of drug fauci acknowledg that there may be problem but declar that mani import and good idea have met resist earli on we have to have flexibl in allow peopl who have no altern this is an import new approach let worri about the problem as they aris you cant abort the whole process becaus of potenti problem despit their worri about the immedi impact of the parallel track on current or plan aid clinic trial most research are confid that in general the futur of control clinic trial is safe may aid clinic trial if parallel track work in aid there will be pressur from peopl with other sever chronic ill to have similar access to drug said schooley but i dont think this will deliv a blow to clinic trial in a clinic trial your talk about more than just access to drug your also talk about free access to the best specialist in the area and everyth that goe with it i dont think clinic trial will ever dri up this might even make them better groopman of new

conceptu veri close to the plan publish under the sarney administr the principl involv is that price and wage must be left unregul and that point is absolut fundament to understand the logic behind the program arida say in this interview with o estado de sao paulo calda economist affonso celso pastor say that this plan has resurrect the origin version of the cruzado plan as propos in an articl by you and andr lara resend in 1984 arida the plan is conceptu veri close to the articl we publish in 1984 as far as it basic outlin is concern but it similar with the cruzado plan as that plan was actual implement is minim this plan has no price freez schedul or price control the basic idea is that price and wage must be left unregul and that point is absolut fundament to understand the logic behind the program brazil is still live with the concept under the cruzado plan and it is surpris that later program were attempt to repeat that experi success this program is abandon that under concept we are announc in advanc everi step that we take our polici is one of absolut consist and with the except of the wage issu what we have done now is exact what we announc last decemb calda but it was announc in decemb that the price of public servic would immedi be convert into urv unit of real valu and that did not happen arida there are differ in detail in the pace but as far as the basic concept is concern what we are do now is exact what we announc in decemb we are implement a program without surpris on the principl that brazil is a market economi calda doe the plan contain an altern for reliev the hardship suffer by the needi arida we are go to rethink the govern structur of social expenditur we are studi conceptu interest propos for the introduct of a guarante minimum incom program one such propos be the one drawn up by senat eduardo suplici the idea is to improv live condit for the poor popul by use budget resourc shift from other item so as not to throw the budget out of balanc that idea is be discuss and sinc it implement requir onli an administr decis by the execut branch it will not be long in come calda you talk about the import of leav price and wage unregul whi were rule for wage adopt arida that aspect has frequent been misunderstood if we left wage negoti entir unregul it is possibl that some wage would be below averag while other would be abov depend on the categori and especi the region involv forc convers to the averag actual function econom as a protect mechan it doe not result in ani loss at all and it protect the poorest sector of the work class moreov forc convers has legal justif deriv from the rule for the nomin irreduc wage level guarante by the constitut this differenti wage from all other price and it was what led us to adopt convers to the averag calda there are propos in congress to amend provision measur 434 in the direct of a wage trigger would the administr go along with that arida the concept under the cruzado plan is surpris aliv in societi propos for wage trigger and for price increas express in urv are be reviv without a clear understand of what the urv is the reason be that everyon is alway rais price it make no sens to agre to a wage trigger the correct econom respons in case of price specul is to let the market oper calda the oligopoli are not accustom to obey the rule of the marketplac arida there are except there are specif case that cannot be ignor but as a philosophi the concept must be that of the marketplac that is what make sens for this program the provision measur doe not prevent the exist of index claus it requir onli that they run for one year calda will the increas negoti between union and employ be unregul arida of cours the principl of free negoti will be respect but there is a big differ between a wage increas base on free negoti increas demand or increas product and one base on automat applic of the index claus there is noth to object to in the first case sinc it involv natur phenomena in a market economi the second case is base on a predetermin situat that we must avoid as for the question of whether loss will or will not occur when the real is introduc i would point out that the entir matter of rule for issu the real and provid back for it has not come up yet that is an import point to be brought up further down the road calda could you tell us anyth about it arida i prefer not to but the point i would like to make is onc again that we do not want to repeat previous experi in which even though the unit of currenc was chang there was no substanti chang either in the institut framework or in the condit for issu the new currenc i am use generic express institut framework rule of issu and back for the currenc to emphas that we are talk about a differ monetari system associ with the new currenc that contrast with the previous plan in which the monetari system remain unchang calda is there realli a two month deadlin for adopt the real arida look so far we have not done anyth base on the elector timet we said that we would not begin the second phase until the first was complet and that was how it turn out the third phase will actual depend on our assess that the econom condit are most appropri for begin the third phase there is no pressur no timet calda what do you mean by appropri condit would that be when inflat in term of the urv stand at zero arida this matter of the urv is be misunderstood sinc the urv is base on a basket of currenc we will have a mixtur of three indic there will be urv inflat when one such index is higher than the averag for the three but sinc the averag is equidist by definit urv inflat in one index mean that there must be urv deflat in anoth just by the natur of thing so the question of so call urv inflat is not a concern as regard the proper econom condit for introduc the real we need to assess the process of form a new social pact chang in the tax situat and the issu of constitut revis the basic featur of the way the economi is develop calda but arent you afraid that the specul of the past few day will caus urv inflat arida i understand the problem but i would remind you that there is alway disciplin in demand whi is it that brazilian automobil do not cost 100 000 the reason is not that auto manufactur would not like to charg 100 000 the reason is that no one would buy their product a real price increas when the economi is competit with unrestrict import and so on is subject to built in restraint certain specul bubbl are disciplin by demand itself as for the decis to introduc the real that decis will be made at the proper time without refer to the elector timet so far we have not done anyth subject to the elector timet they said we were go to implement the plan in januari so that it would be success in april now the date has been chang to 1 may becaus that is worker day there are no elector consider in this program it follow it own logic calda there are certain case in which the free market doe not function in brazil the school have convert their month fee to urv without consult the parent of the pupil the parent must either pay what the school want or remov their children arida there are specif exampl of abus in which govern arbitr is use i am not say that that is one exampl neither am i be radic or naiv i am state the basic philosophi behind the program which is base on a free market on freedom for the econom agent to agre on new pact this program has an educ side it involv confid in the democrat process prior announc and discuss and confid in the support of societi in congress and in the market mechan calda in what area could constitut revis help the plan arida the time we were contempl had constitut revis occur sooner the stabil of a countri doe not take place in one day and it will not occur even on the day when the real replac the urv it is a lengthi process from the standpoint of time in that process structur reform of the economi are absolut vital in order to ensur stabil that is where the import of constitut revis increas becaus revis can open up opportun for the economi to modern itself and for the govern to defin it role and specif function it is essenti to reform the welfar and health system redefin the issu of legal monopoli and simplifi and restructur the tax system those are structur reform which when you get down to it constitut the real foundat of stabil much more so than the emerg tax issu the urv or the real calda all indic are that the assembl on revis is go to elimin the monopoli on telecommun but that the petroleum monopoli will remain arida defend the monopoli is complet wrong telecommun are a dramat exampl from the sharehold standpoint the privat of telecommun has alreadi occur the govern now own 17 5 percent of telebra and the rest is entir in privat hand from the standpoint of a good privat program the way in which telebra share were sold over the cours of time was toler they were sold at ridicul low price without consult the treasuri which held the control interest at all the onli question today is the legal obstacl sinc ownership is alreadi privat the import thing to emphas is that the whole world provid exampl of the advantag of competit in the telecommun industri there is no room for doubt on that score calda some economist have been say that the govern itself will encourag inflat in real cruzeiro in order to forc price up provok a recess and allow the new currenc to take off with a safeti cushion is that so arida the program is go to be manag we have no intent of deliber provok an acceler of inflat it has never been consid that is machiavellian mad calda the express econom financi equilibrium as found in articl 7 of the provision measur is be interpret to mean the intent to establish a price schedul in the move toward the real in what case would that be use arida there cannot be a price schedul as regard the express you mention there is some concern over

preliminari studi suggest potent drug may prevent or delay for year the type i form of the diseas diabet specialist around the countri are begin human trial of a new treatment that may be the most import advanc in the diseas sinc the advent of insulin therapi for the first time physician are identifi youth who are at high risk of develop juvenil onset diabet and treat them in hope of prevent or at least delay for mani year the onset of the diseas in the most promis of the trial physician are treat the prospect diabet with a potent drug that suppress the immun system preliminari data suggest that in mani case this will halt the autoimmun attack on the pancrea that caus the diseas the stake are high between 750 000 and 1 million american suffer from juvenil onset diabet also known as insulin depend or type i diabet accord to the american diabet assn and 13 000 to 15 000 new case are diagnos each year most peopl contract type i diabet dure childhood but a small percentag develop it as adult although insulin inject can control the overt symptom such as excess thirst urin and coma most diabet eventu develop serious complic includ kidney damag nerv damag in the arm and leg and vision loss treatment for diabet and it complic cost the unit state about 20 4 billion each year even if the new therapi could onli delay the onset of diabet it would offer patient sever more year of life free of these disabl complic and should it prevent the diseas the patient would be free of those complic indefinit research say although they would have to undergo the new therapi for the rest of their live this is an extraordinarili promis avenu for studi said robert e silverman head of the diabet branch at the nation institut of diabet and digest and kidney diseas in bethesda md i dont want to overst it signific but this could realli be hot stuff the trial to be conduct at the univers of florida health scienc center the joslin diabet center at harvard medic school denver children hospit and the univers of washington in seattl repres an excit possibl ad richard kahn medic director of the american diabet assn the new therapi has been found effect in extens studi on laboratori anim the best evid that it will work in human is seen in the experi of peggi polopolus 21 who began the therapi in a pilot project five year ago at that time physician at the univers of florida health scienc center predict she would develop type i diabet within six month she still has not contract the diseas polopolus is be treat with a power drug call imuran the drug suppress the immun system in much the same way it doe to prevent the reject of transplant organ research caution that littl is known about imuran long term effect but they are enthusiast about it prospect if it the therapi work a child of 10 might be on it for 60 year and that a long time kahn said we dont know what the drug will do to them but we do know what is go to happen to them if they develop diabet and that could be much wors the new approach to therapi is base on the grow recognit that type i diabet is an autoimmun diseas in which the bodi attack it own tissu in this case the insulin secret beta cell of the pancrea insulin help most of the bodi cell take up biolog fuel especi the sugar glucos in the absenc of insulin the glucos accumul to high level in the blood then the kidney overwork themselv to filter excess glucos into urin meanwhil bodi cell starv in a sea of plenti and thus must break down their own store of fat and protein for energi dure this breakdown acid byproduct call keton build up in the blood combin with the dehydr these keton induc coma and death type i diabet can be treat with daili inject of insulin these allow the patient to live a predomin normal life but becaus the inject are given onli two to four time per day at most level of glucos in the blood vari wide and these variat are thought to caus the complic of diabet scientist do not yet know whi the immun system attack the beta cell but both genet and viral infect are thought to be involv diabet specialist onc thought that the destruct of the beta cell was a fair rapid process occur perhap over a matter of a few month now howev it is clear that the process can take as long as seven year and that the onset of diabet itself doe not occur until at least 80 of the beta cell in the pancrea have been destroy henc if that destruct process can be detect it might be possibl to arrest it befor too much damag is done the key seem to lie in certain antibodi whose normal function is to fight diseas diabet victim howev are plagu with antibodi that attack their own bodi in the last 15 year research have discov three differ antibodi that can indic destruct of beta cell islet cell autoantibodi is thought to be direct against a fat molecul found in the interior of islet cell antibodi against insulin present in virtual all patient who have receiv insulin therapi are believ to exist year befor the onset of diseas the most recent identifi and potenti most import antibodi work against an unidentifi protein 64 k which appear to be present in onli the membran of beta cell pathologist mark a atkinson of the univers of florida has found that this antibodi can be detect in human as mani as seven year befor diabet symptom occur if elev concentr of all three antibodi are present in a person blood kahn said then it a virtual certainti that person will develop diabet within three year for sever year research at various medic center have been treat newli diagnos type i diabet with the immun suppress drug cyclosporin the same drug that has revolution organ transplant dure the last decad in an effort to retard develop of the diseas the treatment typic delay the patient need for insulin from six month to two year but no longer the problem is that by the time these patient had symptom of diabet they had lost most of their insulin produc islet cell said florida endocrinologist william riley furthermor cyclosporin has a number of serious side effect includ liver damag and an increas incid of cancer in an articl in the current issu of the journal diabet care endocrinologist rebecca lipton and her colleagu at the univers of pittsburgh conclud that the benefit from such therapi are too low to justifi the risk further use of the immuno suppress agent cyclosporin cannot be justifi they wrote the approach must therefor be to treat children befor they actual develop the symptom of diabet and to use a drug that has fewer side effect than cyclosporin said florida pathologist noel maclaren the test for antibodi identifi potenti diabet and the drug of choic is imuran which has been use for a quarter centuri as an anti reject drug and for a somewhat shorter time as a treatment for rheumatoid arthriti it is less effect than cyclosporin at block reject but it has fewer side effect peggi polopolus who now work for an advertis agenc in new york citi was the first patient riley and maclaren treat with imuran peggi was 14 when her younger sister eleni develop type i diabet the florida research were then screen larg number of diabet relat to studi the reliabl of antibodi test they found that islet cell autoantibodi were present in peggi but at low level becaus her grandfath had also had type i diabet and two aunt had the less sever but more common form of diabet known as type ii the research continu watch her type i diabet has long been known to run in famili sibl of diabet patient have as much as an 11 risk of develop the condit much higher than the overal popul risk of 16 case per 100 000 about a year later her blood sugar level start climb and her insulin level start fall riley put her on imuran and she has been take two 50 milligram tablet everi day sinc polopolus said the imuran therapi has not had ani advers effect on her ive had cold everi onc in a while but i was prone to get cold anyway she did develop mononucleosi dure colleg but riley believ that was unrel to imuran use most import her blood sugar level which was abov normal when she began the regimen drop back into the normal rang and has stay there ever sinc polopolus believ she has been incred lucki to be spare the insulin inject that her sister must take riley maclaren and their colleagu treat one other patient an 8 year old girl who had more beta cell damag than polopolus when she began the therapi the onset of her diseas was delay for four year after begin her therapi howev the research decid not to treat ani more patient until they had accumul more inform on the predict valu of the antibodi we were too far ahead of ourselv riley said we couldnt convinc other peopl we had the data now base on sever studi in which imuran prevent develop of diabet in rodent they believ they have the data and other research agre in april the nation institut of diabet and digest and kidney diseas conven in washington to consid their and other research that confer conclud that the time was ripe to begin wider clinic trial research at the four medic center plan to screen 8 000 to 10 000 close relat of patient with type i diabet the initi screen will be for islet cell autoantibodi individu who test posit will then be studi for insulin antibodi and impair insulin secret those who test posit for these characterist will be enrol in the studi those who do not will be re examin everi six month as mani as 80 of those who are posit for these test are expect to develop diabet within five year without treatment the accuraci could be improv riley said if they test for anti 64 k antibodi but that test is still too expens and cumbersom but he predict it will be use within a year or so from this test the four center expect to identifi 75 to 80 children who are at high risk these will be treat with imuran and monitor for as long as necessari the first patient identifi began imuran treatment in florida four week ago meanwhil research at harvard are attempt a differ approach test in anim have shown that administ insulin to potenti diabet befor the pancrea is sever damag can interfer with the immun attack even block it complet dure the therapi call beta cell rest the pancrea sharpli reduc it insulin product furthermor the protein on the surfac of beta cell that are attack by the immun system disappear halt the attack said harvard endocrinologist richard jackson two children have so far been enrol in the studi 16 year old sean finley of alexandria la and 9 year old john moor of indianapoli each take two dose of insulin per day that total about one quarter the normal daili dose for a diabet everi nine month they fli to boston for a week of intens intraven insulin therapi that attempt to shut off the pancrea complet the hope is that even though the boy have to take insulin daili the pancrea will continu to function well enough to prevent the wide swing in blood sugar concentr that caus the complic of diabet sean has been in the program 18 month and john for 12 month with no appar declin in pancreat function each was expect to develop diabet within three year of diagnosi so it is too soon to tell if the treatment is success the harvard group hope to enrol three to five more patient in the trial but endocrinologist georg eisenbarth conced that most pre diabet the group identifi will be enrol in the imuran trial becaus it seem more promis if the clinic trial prove success the next stage will expand the procedur to larger popul group even though relat of diabet have a high risk of develop the diseas they nonetheless repres a small minor of all type i diabet victim eventu the entir popul under age 25 would have to be screen an except daunt prospect and becaus the age of onset vari children would have to be screen period in order to detect the first sign that task would be simplifi if research could identifi a gene that would be high predict of diabet risk but that possibl is in the distant futur and research are now concentr onli on the first stage the therapi maclaren said are certain go to work the question we are go to have to settl are for how long how well and at what cost and even if we are onli abl to delay onset for a number of year ad

of the game for now his potenti is tuck away he wont be a standout until he learn the nuanc of indoor which is vast differ from the outdoor game he play with such skill at nevada las vega where he was name all big west confer in 1987 and 1988 the way keith look at it his medic histori has noth to do with his life he live he play he even get impati with other who have been down the same road a problem i find with transplant patient is that theyr so wrap up in themselv keith say they think that they realli have surviv the no 1 futurist oper of all time and they think theyr so wonder i tri to separ from that it bother me a lot a lot of group still approach me and say will you speak at this and speak at that and it better for me to realli say no becaus im basic go to talk down to them and say look you guy are con yourselv i realli dont think it a big deal i think it a psycholog big deal and peopl have to get past that and it sad for peopl who cant keith went to one support group meet after his transplant about 25 peopl attend all transplant patient from british columbia keith was sit next to one guy who stood up gave his name and said im go back to work next week everybodi applaud keith ask how long ago was your transplant he respond almost a year now and keith was think im out of here that it i couldnt get out of there quick enough i went onc and that was it keith younger and in far better shape than most transplant patient go into the oper had a much differ timet were talk about a guy who was think about do 440 yard repeat two month after the oper say david keith simon father he came home from the support group session and said aw dad i cant put up with this anymor in all due respect theyr a bunch of old weasel wit the week follow his oper his brother adam flew oversea to spend a few day with him he expect to find him lie in bed with all kind of tube in his nose instead a few day after the oper simon weigh all of 125 pound was wander the hall push his iv stand in front of him the onli thing adam could think to say is what the hell are you do and simon just told him he was take a littl hike to the restroom david even warn simon physic therapist in england what she was in for she kept tell him no you cant do that he would go to the surgeon and ask and the surgeon would tell him if he felt he had the strength to do someth to give it a tri so he would he had the therapist reduc to tear david say she had to take a holiday two week after the oper keith was out of the hospit recuper in an apart his parent had rent in cambridg on one typic wet and raini day about a month after the oper keith was home alon he figur this was as good a time as ani to see if he was capabl of a jog so he put his short on and away he went and i mayb got half a mile he say mayb and that was it i was huf sure but i think that was the onli time the psycholog barrier might have gotten in my way that was the onli time it might have been the onli time in his life that his mind was a roadblock simon is the first to admit that adam who is a year older was alway a much better soccer player simon drove himself to keep up there were the juggl contest in the back yard the object was to keep the ball in the air as mani time as you could hit it with first the left foot and then the right adam pick it up the first time and did 300 which simon say show his unbeliev natur talent simon took his turn he got to about 14 so simon began come home everi singl day after school to practic hour and hour and final he could do 500 and then hed come back out and do 750 simon say of adam and hed never pick up a ball again but simon keith has never been one to get discourag a setback is onli one if you let it set you back he doesnt there is anoth stori that is recal by his father a soccer coach who grew up in england when simon was 17 the coach of the canadian nation team took a look at him and told him he was good but not quit good enough david say the coach was concern that simon was onli 5 feet 7 a week later with the same coach watch from the stand simon score the tie goal in the championship game for his senior men team which went on to take the titl to do so he out jump a player who was 6 3 and pop the ball in with his head walk out david say he made a point of look at the guy and i couldnt resist say not bad for a 5 foot 7 guy whos too small hard to believ as it may be keith treat his heart troubl in about the same fashion as ani old soccer game the may befor the juli oper a time when keith was go downhil quick his best friend tak niketa went with him to the airport on the day he was to fli to london to see a specialist niketa was worri and was search for the word to tell keith how much he care but keith was so matter a fact about the whole thing that niketa never realli said anyth he look at me and said ill see you at the end of the summer niketa say when he said that i knew hed be back it seem that keith biggest concern

you come to a hotel you want to go to the restaur where everyon in new york is go doesnt it make sens that the restaur would be in this hotel and doesnt it make sens that when you come to new york that the best nightclub also be in the hotel in recent year new york has seen it night life evolv from underground club to intim supper club the restaur as theater trend and current a retro flashback to 70s style mega disco schrager current take on the citi night life is that it lack direct it lack focus energi there are a lot of problem unfortun that come with nightclub the drug the traffic and i think the politician have been deal with the problem by make it more difficult to open up nightclub i think theyr essenti i went around to a bunch of club last friday and there no glamour there no mix

take much to get a momentum go schrager order an espresso and take exact one sip in the cours of an hour doe he miss the nightclub busi no he say quick the nightclub busi did well for steve and me but basic it taught us a number of thing that prepar us for the hotel busi we learn to creat magic becaus you realli dont have anyth but the magic were still tri to creat magic here the onli thing is that we have a product but the way i think about the nightclub busi is a littl bit the way i think about high school it was great i have fond memori of it but it over with and i have no desir to be in it

think itll be a littl more civil somewher between what go on in a salon in a galleri open perhap a cocktail parti schrager is well awar that the club could be a white hot success one minut a has been b list nightspot the next alreadi the hotel itself is generat enough press to be do warp speed toward over hype and hes thought about what the fallout could be i dont think itll be a club with noth but magic what were tri to do is bring in product that last he say like if you have good food like the copacabana had in the 40s if you have realli intellig hip entertain polici that doesnt necessarili mean big name entertain it will last becaus your provid a servic to peopl peopl need place to go out to he call the hotel a friend oasi where the concierg can guid you to the kind of restaur where youd feel comfort where you can trade workout tip with the bellman who look like an armani model but behind the new and improv egalitarian schrager lurk a glimmer of the old day you glimps it when you ask about whi there is no paramount sign outsid the hotel in fact there is noth mark it exist save two clay flower pot place just outsid the entranc i didnt put the name outsid

for 200 year with peopl this sick i cant believ we could have miss it for so long he said i think it someth that has exist as long as virus but some new co factor has been ad as well in search for

increas in syphili to two thing one of which is drug use said dr robert rolf of the feder center for diseas control the second reason is that in a number of area there a real problem of access to std care philadelphia was one of the first citi to see a dramat increas in infecti syphili in 1985 there were just 317 report case that number has leap everi year sinc to 1 293 in 1988 a figur expect to near doubl this year report gonorrhea case also increas from 17 345 in 1985 to 22 976 in 1988 the actual number may be higher sinc public health offici believ as mani as 50 to 80 of all syphili and gonorrhea case go unreport at the same time citi support for sexual transmit diseas control drop the sole public clinic for sexual transmit diseas screen and treatment in philadelphia reduc it hour by 20 between 1986 and 1988 with clinic registr stop earlier and earlier and more patient be turn away patient visit drop near 10 it not a matter of demand said martin goldberg senior public health advis with the citi depart of public health it a reflect of the limit number of hour what increas is the number of patient turn away without servic there have been similar problem in los angel counti where the infecti syphili rate climb from 1 558 in 1984 to 2 770 in 1986 to 4 198 in 1987 the syphili incid per 100 000 popul in los angel counti was 55 6 in 1988 near four time the nation averag part of the fund problem offici say is traceabl indirect to aid sinc the earli 1980s aid has domin sexual transmit diseas control fund money for other diseas has remain virtual flat mani health worker and research train in sexual transmit diseas have shift to the fight against the human immunodefici virus that caus aid i think that both in term of financi resourc and human resourc there is no question that the aid epidem has been a mix bag said dr judith wasserheit of the feder nation institut on allergi and infecti diseas which conduct sexual transmit diseas research there has been a real siphon of fund from std control to hiv relat work said wasserheit chief of the sexual transmit diseas branch i think that is reflect as well in the avail of peopl to provid std servic she emphas that research fund has remain flat and has not been actual cut some physician too have let down their guard routin screen for syphili ceas in mani place dure the 1970s when it appear to mani to be no longer a threat now that it has resurfac some have respond slowli case have gone undetect for exampl congenit syphili can be prevent if diagnos earli in a woman pregnanc it can also be treat success if the newborn is test but pregnant women are go untest despit law requir test and babi are go untreat not test in prenat care a review by los angel counti health offici of the 75 report case of babi born with syphili in 1988 turn up a disturb fact some of the mother had receiv prenat care but appear never to have been test for syphili in 20 case the mother had test posit for syphili but the opportun to cure the babi was miss at deliveri the babi born without obvious symptom went untest or untreat develop symptom onli after leav the hospit the counti studi also found two babi born symptomat by mother who had been treat improp they had been given erythromycin an antibiot that doe not cross the placenta well and therefor cannot be count on to cure syphili in the fetus the manag of syphili is kind of a lost art said dr deborah cohen who head the counti studi i think there still a lot of physician that dont know what all the test mean and how to interpret the lab result the burden of the epidem fall disproportion on women and children an estim 1 million american women a year develop pelvic inflammatori diseas when infect like chlamydia spread into the uterus and fallopian tube accord to feder statist most of the women are under age 25 and have not yet had children the diseas leav them 10 time as like as other women to experi a pregnanc occur outsid the uterus the rate of so call ectop pregnanc per 1 000 report pregnanc in the unit state has near quadrupl sinc 1970 pelvic inflammatori diseas is also link to infertil one in four women with the diseas lose

heard about them but we did not see them we watch them but we kept our distanc now we are abl to ask aid patient question and it is now possibl for them to answer we can take their pictur but from behind due to humanitarian famili and social consider after all societi still reject peopl who have aid and hold them respons for their diseas even though some aid patient have noth to do with the fact that they contract this diseas here is an account of the tour from the begin it is a tour of the unit where aid patient are treat these patient out of love and compass share a concern about not transmit their diseas to other that is greater than the physician nowher els can one see human relationship like those we saw in that unit between the peopl who work in it and their patient let us start with the pictur in the heart of egypt we are told everi year that the figur that tell us how mani peopl have aid are estim and we are also told that the sampl is a random sampl this then is the question and it is also the issu when will we know precis the number of egyptian who have aid the onli center in cairo that provid dialysi servic to patient who have kidney diseas and who also have the aid virus is locat in al abbasiyah hummiyat hospit servic at that center start in novemb 1990 with six machin serv 22 patient includ seven women three of those women and eight men have die the caus of death was kidney failur and not infect with the aid virus and even this week the center which is staf by two specialist seven intern and 12 femal nurs is offer it servic to 21 patient includ six women we met two patient the moment we enter the unit one of them was a 53 year old farmer from suez that man who is marri and is the father of six children two of them girl was refer to the dialysi unit in al abbasiyah by the medic commiss in suez becaus he is the onli dialysi patient in the governor who has the virus it would not be possibl to design a dialysi machin in his governor for his exclus use he endur the commut to cairo twice a week to undergo dialysi at the al abbasiyah unit a decre from the ministri of health requir that everi governor that has a number of patient who suffer from kidney diseas and who are hiv posit set asid a certain number of dialysi machin for the use of those individu if howev a governor has no more than one or two such patient they would be refer to the closest dialysi center treat similar patient in anoth governor the patient from suez doe not know how he becam infect with the aid virus the second patient was a 45 year old unemploy woman who is the mother of two daughter and two son she too doe not know how she becam infect this woman who has kidney diseas and undergo dialysi at the dialysi unit in al abbasiyah infect her husband whose infect was discov when sampl were taken from him and test in one of the test that are conduct period on those who have contact with hiv posit patient the femal nurs who watch the dialysi machin is wear medic glove her face is cover with a mask and her hair is cover with a steril cap she is wear an apron to protect her chest and she is also wear dispos shoe which are worn onli onc anyon enter the unit has to be wear protect cloth similar to that which she is wear fear of aid howev is not the reason for that protect cloth is requir for those who work with dialysi patient to prevent contamin these articl of cloth are destroy as soon as one exit the unit i ask the nurs arent you afraid of becom infect the immedi repli come from the nurs who declin to mention her name or have her pictur taken was this the patient are more care than we are about not infect us becaus they are certain that if there is a singl case of infect in anyon work in the unit everyon will stay away and no one will have anyth to do with them dr khalid salamah a dialysi specialist interject sampl are taken period from physician and nurs who have contact with the patient to ascertain that they are not infect the real problem doe not lie in the contact we have with the patient in the unit but it lie with the patient have to face other peopl for exampl the surgeon who receiv a certain fee for the perman incis he make in a dialysi patient ask for thousand of pound when he know that the patient has aid also if a patient outsid the unit has to see a dentist he hesit to tell that dentist about his diseas and he wait until he come to us some of those patient will see a physician becaus of persist pain but they dont tell that physician about their infect the burden then fall on physician who must be cautious and care in deal with all patient they must continu steril all the equip and tool they use to protect themselv and their patient from the possibl of infect we ask dr qadri imarah director of al abbasiyah hummiyat hospit about the procedur that would be follow with a person who is found to have the aid virus dr imarah said if infect with the virus is confirm the infect person regist his name in the health offic of his governor the patient is monitor and his condit is check everi three month the communic diseas section of the health depart offer health awar and educ servic to the patient and his famili and to those who have contact with him the symptom of immun defici diseas do not usual becom evid in a person who has the virus until some time after he is infect and that period of time is determin by the abil of that person immun system to resist infect when that person resist fail his condit deterior and it becom incumb upon him to go to the hummiyat hospit for

scientif advanc those work with patient whose diseas is advanc have becom more care and more relax this is becaus the ministri of health has sent peopl abroad for train on how to work with aid patient the ministri also hold cours for those who work in the field of communic diseas dr imarah then ad the first case of aid in egypt was discov in novemb 1986 and the patient who was a foreign was isol in al abbasiyah hummiyat hospit and then deport to his countri there were also three childbirth procedur for three women who had the virus these were accompani by consider turmoil becaus physician and nurs were fear about becom infect as a result of their involv in those procedur in the past we use to destroy everyth that was use by patient and we use to disinfect the entir room becaus we did not know for sure how the diseas was transmit the unit where patient were kept in isol use to be treat as though it were an aw place now howev patient are not kept in total isol they are monitor and they are not isol unless their health deterior and they requir total supervis in most case patient die in the hospit i ask the director of al abbasiyah hummiyat hospit about the patient i ask him what kind of peopl they were and what were their occup he repli most of them were employ abroad some of them underw surgic procedur that requir blood transfus and the blood they receiv was contamin the rest becam infect as a result of have multipl sexual partner and use contamin syring for drug use these peopl are sailor pilot and employe of travel bureaus who have contact with group of tourist the most recent hospit death of an aid patient was that of a sailboat owner who oper his sailboat on the nile this man had sexual relat with femal tourist al musawwar do you have an aid patient who is be detain in the hospit at the present time dr imarah said we have an italian nation who is in custodi pend a court case we ask that he be isol so that those who have contact with him in detent do not becom expos to infect aid in egypt we leav al abbasiyah hummiyat hospit which is consid a model hospit for the treatment of aid patient to explor where els the diseas can be found in egypt the first aid case in egypt was discov in novemb 1986 sinc then the nation program to fight aid has been oper in conjunct with the world health organ who by the end of 1987 there were five case of aid in egypt four were egyptian and one was a foreign other aid case were subsequ found and eventu the number of case rose to 68 in 1990 some of those patient becam symptomat by the end of last octob the total number of person who were found to have the aid virus and to have full blown aid had amount to 313 egyptian 150 of them die the number of foreign who were found to have the diseas was 210 and they were return to their countri dr muhammad subhi abd al rahim first undersecretari minist for prevent medicin at the ministri of health said all the egyptian who have the virus becam infect while they were abroad they were infect by receiv contamin blood after a surgic procedur or by have sex with a sexual partner who had the virus there are except to this general there are some singular case like for exampl that of the young woman from dikirni who unwit marri a man who knew he had the aid virus in that case the woman and her fetus becam infect there is also the al gharbiyah man with kidney diseas who use to undergo dialysi without know that he was infect with the virus neglig at the center where he was receiv the dialysi treatment was respons for infect 30 person dialysi center have been given strict instruct to examin patient and to ascertain that they have no infecti diseas befor place them on dialysi machin anoth basic rule also has to do with the machin which must be steril and as a prevent measur the filter must be chang after each patient so that the safeti of it use can be complet assur health depart check on dialysi patient everi three month to ascertain that they are free of the virus we are the one who found the virus in the al gharbiyah patient in the cours of conduct this period test on patient he ad sever locat in the various governor have been design for monitor the diseas among those group that are most vulner to infect most import the peopl who have vener diseas drug addict prison inmat pregnant women foreign resid in egypt peopl who are employ in the field of tourism peopl who have blood diseas and prostitut by 1992 the total number of blood sampl drawn from these group and test came to approxim 365 577 the total number of case found to be posit was 48 al musawwar with regard to the blood bag is each bag test to ascertain that the blood in the bag is virus free dr abd al rahim said the ministri suppli 213 blood bank these are main as well as branch offic with the necessari equip for test blood bag for possibl contamin with the aid virus hepat and also syphili more than 939 000 bag have been test sinc 1986 in addit the ministri has oversight author over all the blood bank and we would not think twice about shut down ani blood bank that doe not follow instruct al musawwar how old were those egyptian who are carri the virus when they becam infect dr abd al rahim repli most peopl who carri the aid virus are between the age of 15 and 40 year they repres 61 percent of aid patient there are eight peopl who have the virus who are under 15 year old they were be treat for their blood diseas and they were be given the eighth coeffici as publish that we use to import befor 1986 they repres 26 percent of the total number of aid case 81 percent of which are male and 19 percent are femal dr subhi abd al rahim had this to say about the ministri role in protect citizen from infect with the aid virus we are tri to spread health awar among all group of citizen we want them to know how they might becom infect so they can avoid infect in addit we are monitor the spread of the diseas ensur the safeti of the blood suppli and use dispos plastic syring when immun peopl educ peopl about how infect is transmit is the most that the ministri can do aid is a diseas that afflict a healthi person who will fail to avoid the poor conduct that result in his infect aid is a diseas that no one can get in spite of himself foreign al musawwar with regard to foreign in egypt how do you ascertain that they do not have aid dr abd al rahim repli a foreign who come to egypt and intend to stay for sever month or longer to studi or to work is not given a work permit or a resid permit until he has been examin and a clean bill of health is issu to him by the central laboratori of the ministri of health with regard to transit tourist howev no one has the right to examin them to ascertain that they are free of the virus their temporari resid doe not pose a threat becaus the diseas can onli be transmit through blood or sexual intercours in order to have the full pictur about aid one would natur take a look at what is happen with aid in the world around us and also in the east mediterranean the area set off by the who the who estim that more than 10 million adult and children worldwid have been infect with the aid virus sinc it was first discov approxim two million person are now in an advanc stage of the diseas which start on the averag 10 year after a person is infect with the virus for the first time the organ estim that the total number of men women and children infect with the aid virus by the year 2000 will be between 30 and 40 million person between 12 and 18 million person will have full blown aid by then and approxim 90 percent of the peopl who are expect to becom infect with the aid virus dure this decad will be in develop countri the who expect develop countri to suffer more from the spread of this diseas becaus the suprem polit author in those countri do not provid adequ support for the effort that are necessari to prevent this diseas and to fight against it there are also other fundament obstacl to the effect prevent of this diseas there is for exampl ignor about the natur of the diseas and there is denial that a relationship exist between aid on the one hand and an individu or societi on the other anoth obstacl is the failur to deal serious with the diseas or the inabl to do someth about it enorm catastroph natur other obstacl includ the low social and econom status of women the tradit and cultur practic that make transmitt of the diseas easier and the avoid of inform and frank discuss about sexual matter dr muhammad hilmi wahdan director of prevent at whos east mediterranean region offic said incontrovert evid has prove that the aid virus is transmit basic through the vehicl of individu conduct in some societi riski factor and practic are widespread quit open peopl do not think twice about engag in such practic and they do veri littl to prevent them in such case societi has to play a signific role and it has to interven if it realli want to protect individu health as well as public health from an aid invas in other societi where riski factor and practic are reject outright by societi these factor and practic take place in secret and govern cannot do much to affect them it is in those instanc that the role of societi becom import to confront what is be done in secret and to discuss it candid and unequivoc the featur of the epidem the who identifi the featur of the aid epidem in the east mediterranean region the most import of them are infect came into the region late at first peopl becam infect by import blood or as a result of sexual intercours with person from area where the virus was widespread prostitut is illeg in the region but it is secret practic even though the extent to which it is be practic is not known the extent to which drug are administ by inject is not known but the problem is not a simpl one these countri attach signific import to the ethic valu that are impos by religion and societi by septemb 1992 the total number of case report to the who from 20 countri in the east mediterranean region had amount to 1 399 in addit there were 308 case of ill that occur with aid and are associ with it and there were 4 641 case of peopl who had been infect with the aid virus but who had not shown symptom of the diseas it is estim howev that the real number of case exceed these figur becaus in mani countri diagnosi remain inadequ and case are under report the east mediterranean region is an area that extend from the maghreb to the west of that region all the way to afghanistan in the east seventi five percent of those who have aid are male and 25 percent are femal the age group that has the highest number of report case is that group that is between the age of 30 and 39 those between the age of 20 and 29 are the group with the second highest number of report case that is follow by the group that is made up of those between the age of 15 and 19 almost nine tenth of the case occur among those who are between 15 and 39 year old sexual intercours is the lead way of transmit the virus it is the caus of infect in about 77 percent of report case wherea heterosexu sex which is the preval form of sex account for 69 percent of those case it was also notic that homosexu relationship account for eight percent of the sexual transmit case of the diseas blood transfus and blood product account for 15 percent of the case intraven drug use account for six percent and final two percent of aid case becam infect dure childbirth sex educ if these are the most import characterist of how aid was spread worldwid and in the east mediterranean region what might be the true pictur of how the diseas was spread in egypt which is locat in the heart of the middl east do we have a civil scientif approach for deal with this danger that is come our way is our approach base on confront the fact and act on the basi of those fact or are we buri our head in the sand in an attempt to escap and delay the danger who figur indic that sexual activ is one of the lead caus of infect with the aid virus in the east mediterranean region it is the caus of infect in 77 percent of all case peopl who are uptight will undoubt speak up here and declar that homosexu activ which is the main caus of infect is prohibit by our religion unfortun howev sexual activ among homosexu account for no more than eight percent of the case of infect wherea normal sexual activ account for 69 percent of all case of infect with the diseas it is that which is make sexual conduct the focus of direct attent that is where the emphasi must be place to stop the infect with the diseas this can be done by devot attent to the fact that all young peopl have to be educ a scientif program to teach sex in school dure the preparatori stage of educ has to be devis sex is to be taught in a simpl manner that would be compat with the student abil to absorb and understand the religi and spiritu side of these young peopl is also to be nurtur in addit emphasi must be place on men and women abstain from illegitim sexual relationship that would expos both husband and wive to the risk of infect the respons of implement this role doe not rest sole on the shoulder of the ministri of health it rather fall on everybodi shoulder physician peopl in the media teacher scientist and clergymen everyon in societi has to take part in an inform educ campaign that would be base on clariti candor and disclosur of the fact this is especi import given the fact that the man who is respons for the health of all egyptian proclaim the notion that the credibl of ani offici is determin by that offici knowledg of the truth and the extent to which he proclaim it dr ali abd al fattah the minist of health said it has been prove that the aid virus is spread peopl have to be made awar of the need for abstin and the need to adher to proper moral conduct so that diseas can be avoid we have to call attent to the fact that there are aid case in egypt

physician have seen instanc of hpv spread in case in which no sexual contact is believ to have occur for instanc among non intim member of the same household some wonder whether hpv is spread in other

featur in particular the cell he was studi seem to have in common an unusu caviti around the nucleus and an overabund of a protein call keratin sudden it dawn on meisel the lesion must have come from the same sourc as the wart if hpv caus not just wart but cervic lesion as well and lesion were known in some case to develop into cancer then hpv had a role in the process lead to cervic cancer the cell seem to have to be infect with hpv first say meisel who is also head of the depart of patholog and cytolog at saint sacrement hospit but that is not suffici someth els is act on them cervic cancer has long been thought to be caus at least in part by a sexual transmit infecti agent among the most import risk factor for the diseas is simpli the number of sexual partner a woman has had and

those chang suggest subclin infect or wart more extens abnorm may indic pre malign cell treatment of hpv relat diseas depend upon the symptom there are no drug that can rid the bodi of the virus just as there is no vaccin so physician such as connolli treat the manifest they freez or vapor or slice off the wart and area with abnorm cell the first line of attack is a varieti of chemic administ either by the patient or physician for persist wart and wart on the cervix mani physician use cryosurgeri freez the wart and surround tissu with a low temperatur probe anoth option for extens wart and dysplasia is laser surgeri in which a concentr beam of light serv as a scalpel final a so call cone biopsi is occasion use to slice a cone shape chunk of abnorm tissu from the cervix it is not realli known whi such approach work but they seem to mani peopl treat for wart and dysplasia never experi a recurr by remov a repositori of virus the treatment may be diminish the load of virus in the bodi or they may be trigger an immun respons nevertheless there are limit it clear that you cant cure a viral infect by burn the skin off say dr kenneth l noller chairman of the depart of obstetr and

develop cervic cancer some research have specul that such men are transmit some carcinogen probabl an infecti agent perhap a strain of hpv gynecologist say mani men physician are unfamiliar with hpv infect some of them will just go to their famili practition who just eyebal them and say no you dont have it say dr virginia a siegfri of los angel that may be part of the problem in some of the

ask him about them he conced that he had had them for seven month but he had neglect to tell her and had neglect to have them treat even after she confront him her husband was reluct to see a doctor then he expect nan to be respons for see that he use the medic and even for administ it nan felt betray and disgust their sexual relationship deterior exist problem in their marriag grew wors the thing that shock me was that he was so uninform say nan who believ her husband respons to the diseas contribut signific to their subsequ divorc he knew what they were but he made no effort to

three ectop pregnanc and pelvic inflammatori diseas but at 34 she remain determin to preserv her abil one day to conceiv and bear a child ive live with a lot of pain and this bad equip for year nan said bitter one morn recent in an interview at her home near los angel i am not about to lose it for vener wart unfortun there are as mani question as there are answer about hpv mani more peopl are infect than come down with ani visibl symptom what percentag will develop symptom remain unknown peopl are flip up figur ferenczi say probabl 5 to 15 will show up with some sort of hpv relat diseas of those who do most will develop wart or dysplasia in mani of those the condit might clear spontan if left alon in a small percentag hpv infect will lead to cancer what percentag that will be and who they are is imposs to say im not sure now we know what the true risk is to a woman who has hpv infect say dr john curtin a gynecolog oncologist at the usc school of medicin the infect can remain hidden for long period surfac at ani time one 65 year old woman in minnesota recent develop genit wart inexplic leav her physician dr leo b twigg wonder whi her symptom emerg when they did accord to twigg director of the women cancer center at the univers of minnesota hospit research suggest that symptom may surfac when a patient immun is down other factor probabl caus the immun suppress he say but mayb the virus can too onc the virus is interlock into the cell it like a small comput program or a mini comput hook into a mainfram twigg say the question is where doe it sit next to what oper system what it do there no one realli know what turn the program on anoth question is one foreshadow a half centuri ago in the initi experi with papilloma virus infect in rabbit what are the so call co factor that encourag the progress to cancer are there way women can minim their risk one prime suspect co factor is cigarett smoke opinion is divid on oral contracept other possibl co factor includ addit infecti agent such as the herp virus hormon influenc genet background and environment and dietari factor the nation cancer institut is prepar to tri to answer the co factor and risk question with the help of a studi of 15 000 to 20 000 women research will track them for sever year to determin who among them develop the kind of abnorm known to preced cervic cancer they will then screen the women for hpv infect and those possibl co factor that might have play a role in their symptom thus research hope to be better abl to predict the consequ of hpv infect and what put peopl at greatest risk what certain is if you have an abnorm pap smear or dysplasia you are more like to have the virus detect say dr mark schiffman of the nation cancer institut but if you have hpv today but are normal doe that mean you will get an abnorm smear peopl assum that women with the virus will go on and get dysplasia schiffman say mayb the answer is no mayb most women can fight off the virus with their immun system we are tri to determin for physician and women the mean of infect it is also possibl that in some women wart and mild dysplasia will disappear without treatment for that reason there is disagr among physician about when treatment is warrant and how much differ it make dr jonathan s berek director of gynecolog oncolog at the ucla school of medicin believ that some women are be over treat at consider pain and expens and with limit evid that the therapi realli help but other physician argu that they cannot afford to wait if even a small minor of patient risk develop cancer they suggest that it would be irrespons to not do everyth possibl to protect those patient sinc we dont have the tool to say which will progress your almost forc to over treat the other connolli say furthermor mani patient are anxious to be rid of their wart there is similar controversi about the valu of a new form of hpv test there are now some 60 known strain of the virus in 1987 they were be identifi at a rate of three a month some are found primarili in benign wart some turn up in connect with dysplasia a few seem to be link primarili to invas cancer but the associ are not hard and fast sever compani have develop test capabl of identifi the strain with which a person is infect the first test on the market appear in the unit state earli last year and is be offer by some commerci lab the manufactur suggest that the test be use with the pap smear to alert physician to the presenc of a potenti cancer caus virus the compani claim that onc physician know the strain involv they can monitor their patient accord but some physician counter that all patient should be close monitor anyway they say the associ between specif strain and symptom is not yet suffici clear to justifi alarm or reassur patient on the basi of the test im not sure how to use it to tell you the truth say siegfri of los angel it doesnt chang how we treat the patient and im concern that it might caus more anxieti if the patient are told they have the type that is more close link to cancer in the end research say that panic about hpv is counterproduct most peopl never will develop cervic cancer they repeat point out the diseas anteced are easili detect and treat and in most case the rate of progress is slow enough that a singl miss pap smear will not be crucial but with near half the women in the unit state not undergo regular screen say berek of ucla attent should be focus on encourag those women to chang their lifestyl and get regular checkup berek would like to see more public resourc devot to comprehens cancer screen of all american an approach he and other point out repeat has been proven cost effect but rare attract much polit support so i think the broader issu here is not so much that weve identifi a virus that caus wart a small proport of which are virul and probabl are associ with the develop of genit cancer berek say the issu is whos get screen and whi cant we save those other 6 000 live but statist offer littl comfort to peopl such as patti vurpillat in patti case the wart on her cervix return within a few month of treatment when the clinic advis a second biopsi she balk she fear the pain of anoth biopsi and was lose confid in the clinic where she was be treat unsatisfi and anxious she sought a second opinion in decemb the new physician suggest wait three month wart sometim regress if they dont go away the physician said she might tri onc more freez them off so these day patti vurpillat is wait ive been worri she said sad one recent afternoon it alway in the

this protocol provid a descript of all aspect of the studi includ the ident and qualif of the investig conduct the studi procedur and criteria for select subject the amount of the drug to be administ the durat of use the observ to be made to assess the effect of the drug and the clinic procedur laboratori test and other measur carri out to minim risk to the patient after the ind becom effect and the investig drug is be administ to human subject the sponsor is requir under 312 32 to make both telephon and written safeti report on serious and unexpect advers experi associ with the administr of the drug as well as written report onli on other serious advers event associ with administr of the drug under current 312 33 the sponsor is also requir to submit an annual report contain signific safeti and other inform if fda conclud that a studi would place subject at unreason and signific risk fda may place a studi on clinic hold this mean that the drug may not be administ to subject until the hold is lift see 312 42 fda may also termin the studi under 312 44 base on such safeti concern fda is concern that these ind report requir may not be adequ to protect against some unexpect advers event for exampl there is a potenti for such event to be disguis by patient condit that might lead the investig to conclud that the experiment drug was not implic in those event the agenc believ that certain modif in the way clinic investig are conduct and report may help to ensur that drug toxic is detect as earli as possibl a recent intern task forc that examin an incid that involv a fatal drug toxic that was not detect in earli trial has recommend improv in ind report that the agenc is incorpor into this propos for public consider these improv as explain below are intend to provid more frequent and more complet evalu of potenti serious advers effect so that drug relat event can be detect earlier by sponsor investig and fda a clinic studi of a nucleosid analog fiau result in sever instanc of sever liver injuri and five death begin in june 1993 the studi involv 15 subject with chronic hepat b virus infect fiau had been consid a high promis agent without recogn serious toxic this incid prompt fda to establish a task forc to see whether the data avail prior to the studi gave ani suggest of the serious toxic that emerg the task forc examin data from the 1993 fiau studi as well as data from previous studi on fiau and a close relat drug conduct by anoth sponsor the data from these previous studi was or should have been avail to the sponsor of the 1993 fiau studi the task forc was also to determin whether some differ in process or behavior by investig and sponsor might have made it possibl or more like to have anticip the toxic the propos ind amend contain in this document are larg the result of recommend by the task forc ref 3 focus on hepat and pancreat advers event the task forc review the data and data analys that were avail to investig sponsor and fda at the start of the studi to determin whether improv in the rule govern design analysi and report of data from clinic studi were warrant the task forc found a number of observ and event that suggest an associ between fiau and hepat and or pancreat abnorm howev none of these event was attribut by the sponsor or investig to fiau rather each event even when recogn as tempor relat to a studi was attribut by investig and sponsor to other factor such as concomit drug administr and or concurr ill the task forc found that an overview of the data in which death and serious advers experi were analyz cumul and with the hypothesi that the event were drug relat was not produc and thus was not avail for use by the sponsor the princip investig or fda review rather the analys perform focus on each individu event and determin a plausibl explan other than drug toxic for each occurr the task forc recommend that to detect similar pattern of event reflect toxic in futur studi sponsor should conduct cumul analys with a systemat consider of the possibl that the advers event are caus by the investig drug the propos ind amend would appli to all investig studi conduct under part 312 howev fda invit comment from the public and industri on whether ani or all of the propos requir should appli onli to certain ind whose select could be determin by applic of criteria that could be includ in these regul or onli to certain phase of drug test 1 clinic studi design fda is propos to amend the requir govern ind format and content in 312 23 under current 312 23 a 6 an ind must contain the protocol for each plan studi includ inform such as a statement of the studi object and purpos the criteria for patient select and exclus a descript of the studi design the method for determin the dose s to be administ and the durat of individu patient exposur to the drug and a descript of clinic procedur laboratori test or other measur to be taken to monitor the effect of the drug in human subject and to minim risk in sever instanc fdas fiau task forc found that death and serious hepat and pancreat injuri that appear in retrospect to have been relat to fiau were attribut by investig and sponsor to the subject under diseas or to other drug the subject were take for their condit the task forc made sever recommend intend to improv the likelihood that clinic studi will identifi earli in drug develop drug toxic that mimic the under diseas or the toxic of concomit medic these recommend includ 1 choos studi design and safeti endpoint that increas a studi abil to distinguish drug toxic from under diseas or other drug toxic 2 prospect identifi observ that will trigger certain action by investig and 3 summar safeti data at regular interv with systemat consider of the possibl that advers event are drug relat the propos rule would creat new 312 23 a 6 iii h to requir that the protocol describ ani advers clinic or laboratori outcom in the studi that are to be immedi report to the sponsor these report event might includ death ani life threaten event or ani other serious event that might reflect potenti drug toxic as suggest by preclin data and includ abnorm laboratori result fall outsid of a specifi rang the identifi event and abnorm laboratori valu are to includ those that focus attent on toxic that may target the same organ and bodi system as the under diseas or concomit medic under the propos these event would be report to the sponsor even if they are potenti attribut to the patient under diseas or concomit medic propos 312 23 a 6 iii h would also requir instruct for investig such as report requir remeasur or challeng procedur or discontinu of the drug in respons to identifi event the task forc also recommend that sponsor consid the use of a control group for exampl placebo activ control or histor control in studi that focus on safeti when the under diseas process is like to produc advers event that might be confus with drug toxic the task forc conclud that such control would help detect some advers event consequ propos 312 23 a 6 iii i state that sponsor should consid the use of a formal control group when the under diseas is like to produc advers event that might be confus with drug toxic the task forc also recommend that sponsor attempt to estim the expect incid of death and serious advers event in the studi popul that aris from the under diseas or concomit medic use to treat the diseas this recommend is reflect in propos new 312 23 a 6 iii j that would requir sponsor to provid such estim under the propos ani death or advers event that exceed the estim would creat the presumpt that the event are associ with use of the investig drug and the sponsor would be requir to submit a written safeti report to fda the task forc found that the followup period in some of the fiau and relat studi were too short to detect some of the advers event that occur becaus signific advers event sometim occur week to month after dose with fiau end the task forc recommend that all protocol contain in the ind includ an explicit descript of the length and type of followup to be perform so that the agenc may review the followup procedur task forc report at 57 accord fda is propos to add new 312 23 a 6 iii k to requir that the protocol section of an ind specifi and justifi the length and type of followup for subject after the conclus of dose the justif may be brief for exampl a refer to a studi of a similar drug with the same followup period the followup period would ensur that clinic studi are adequ design to detect drug toxic that occur after the conclus of drug dose the sponsor would propos an appropri followup period base on preclin data experi with other member of the drug class the drug mechan of action and prior human experi the intens of the followup may chang with time eg a full evalu might be schedul for 2 week postdos with a telephon followup for possibl serious event at a later time ordinarili in phase 1 and 2 studi telephon followup should occur at 3 month after the dose is complet but altern timefram and procedur can be propos by the sponsor for some drug like fiau a review of avail data may suggest that the minimum followup period should be longer than 3 month current regul in 312 56 requir sponsor to review and evalu the evid relat to a drug safeti and effect as it is obtain from investig the regul also requir sponsor to report safeti inform to fda the task forc observ that in the fiau studi sponsor may not have had avail adequ resourc to evalu safeti data report by investig the propos rule would amend 312 56 c to requir sponsor in addit to review and evalu safeti and effect inform to develop a safeti monitor and evalu program befor start clinic trial this provis is intend to ensur that sponsor have or will develop adequ resourc to evalu safeti data report by investig and is consist with the task forc recommend see task forc report at 57 consist with this propos requir fda is also propos in new 312 23 a 3 v that an ind contain a descript of ani safeti monitor and evalu program this descript would be in addit to the introductori statement and general investig plan that are requir under current regul 2 safeti report fda is propos sever amend to the requir for ind safeti report in 312 32 fda is propos to alter the period for submit written safeti report under 312 32 c 1 i and d 3 from 10 work day to 15 calendar day and for submit safeti report by telephon under 312 32 c 2 from 3 work day to 7 calendar day fda is also propos to allow telephon safeti report to be made by facsimil transmiss as well as oral by telephon these chang will give sponsor addit time to gather appropri data to help interpret the report befor submit these report fda believ the extend time period would be suffici to alert the agenc to potenti safeti problem especi becaus of the new investig report requir the agenc is propos propos 312 32 c would also permit sponsor to submit ind safeti report to the agenc by use fda form 3500a if fda determin that insuffici data were submit on fda form 3500a the agenc could requir addit narrat data to be submit as explain elsewher in this propos this amend is consist with the propos to use this form for postmarket report of human drug and licens biolog product advers experi fda is also propos to amend the disclaim contain in 312 32 e to emphas that safeti inform submit to fda are not to be consid admiss of causat or liabil the propos would substitut the word part for section so that the revis disclaim would clear appli to all safeti inform submit under part 312 summari of such safeti inform would not constitut a statement or admiss that there was a causal link between the administr of the drug and the subsequ advers event 3 semiannu report fda is propos to amend the period report requir in 312 33 by ad in addit to the annual report a semiannu death and serious advers experi report this chang is intend to ensur that report of death and other serious advers experi in all clinic studi are collect and review in a time and comprehens manner and that the possibl of drug related is alway consid under current regul sponsor must report death and serious and unexpect advers experi within 3 or 10 work day onli if the event are associ with the use of the drug associ with the use of the drug is defin to mean that there is a reason possibl that the experi may have been caus by the drug see 312 32 a death and a summari of serious advers experi that occur in a clinic trial that the sponsor conclud are not associ with use of the drug must be report onli in an ind annual report the task forc found that mani advers experi occur dure the fiau studi that appear in retrospect to have been drug relat were not report in safeti report although at time they were report in the annual report as attribut to caus other than fiau the propos rule therefor would creat a new semiannu report to requir among other thing the submiss of report of all death serious advers experi and studi discontinu result from an advers experi whether expect or unexpect and whether or not there was thought to be a possibl that the death or advers experi was caus by the drug in these twice year report sponsor would also report all death and serious advers experi that occur dure the trial or within the prescrib followup period the report would includ data not onli from studi conduct under the ind but also data from all premarket studi of the drug conduct worldwid with an analysi of all unexpect death serious advers experi and studi discontinu thought to be relat to the studi drug from foreign postmarket clinic trial and from foreign postmarket spontan or requir report system serious advers event should includ laboratori chang that result in discontinu or that are identifi in the studi protocol as report event sponsor would present these data both for the 6 month report interv and cumul and submit an analysi of the data the agenc would expect the analysi to conform general to the evalu of death serious advers experi and discontinu in the section entitl integr summari of safeti inform in fdas guidelin for the format and content of the clinic and statist section of new drug applic fda also recommend that the sponsor employ in prepar the analysi at least one individu who had no involv in conduct the clinic studi the propos would also requir a sponsor to conduct a worst case analysi of the safeti data presum that observ advers event were the result of toxic from the investig drug and then attempt to refut this presumpt with appropri data and evalu task forc report at 59 the analysi should includ estim of the rate of an analyz event occur spontan in the popul and specif analys of case the sponsor would submit the semiannu report for the 6 month period follow the day the ind goe into effect and for each 6 month period thereaft until the end of the followup period specifi in the protocol the report would be due within 60 day of the end of the report period the semiannu safeti report that is due dure the same period as the annual report would be submit with the annual report the task forc recommend task forc report at 59 that fda requir the submiss of all avail autopsi report and medic report concern all death report in these semiannu report becaus in at least one instanc dure the fiau studi the caus of death origin report was not fulli consist with the autopsi and termin medic report later obtain for that subject propos 312 33 b 2 would requir the submiss of these report and would requir the sponsor to clarifi ani inconsist between these report and the caus of death report to fda by the sponsor fda is propos this requir to help ensur that report cover death submit to the agenc are complet and accur under propos 312 33 b 3 at the request of the sponsor or on it own initi fda may modifi certain semiannu report requir where for exampl the clinic studi endpoint is mortal or where the studi is blind and full complianc with the report requir would requir break the blind fda is propos this provis becaus studi vari concern the natur and serious of the diseas to be treat the number of subject expos to the drug and the general pace at which the drug develop proceed 4 special safeti summari in new 312 37 a fda also propos an addit mechan to allow the agenc to obtain safeti data on investig drug and summari of these data not otherwis obtain through other report requir if and when these data are necessari most investig drug do not present unusu safeti concern so that the safeti data contain in the 6 month and annual report as well as the ind safeti report submit under 312 32 would provid adequ inform to allow fda to observ drug safeti some drug howev may rais signific safeti concern either anticip or unanticip so that more comprehens data on event that do not meet the definit of a serious advers reaction as well as those that do are need event that might trigger this heighten scrutini includ agenc experi with similar drug anim toxic studi result and inform deriv from ind safeti annual or semiannu report as recommend by the task forc task forc report at 59 and 60 the propos regul is draft in general languag to allow the agenc in consult with the sponsor flexibl in determin when a report should be requir and what inform it should contain this flexibl is consid necessari becaus the specif of the safeti summari may vari from studi to studi fda anticip that the safeti summari will general not onli contain the result of the cumul analysi of death and serious advers experi contain in the 6 month report but also an analysi of relat event of lesser serious although the task forc recommend that fda requir safeti summari unless an exempt had been grant to the sponsor fda is propos to requir safeti summari onli for those studi or product where the agenc has determin that a specif need for them exist fda would general expect safeti summari to be submit within 30 day after they are request howev the agenc recogn that in case where larg amount of data are requir to be summar and those data are not readili avail or easili summar a longer period of time may be necessari to prepar the summari 5 final clinic studi report inform about fiau risk and benefit that the sponsor might have deriv from the process of collect and analyz studi result was delay or never develop becaus final report were not requir for the earlier clinic studi of fiau and fiac a close relat nucleosid analog thus fda is propos in 312 37 b to requir sponsor to submit when requir by fda a final report or studi summari of a clinic studi fda anticip that final report usual will not be necessari institut requir for semiannu report of death serious advers experi and discontinu and for summar of all safeti data will larg fulfil the need for more care monitor and analysi of potenti drug toxic dure drug test in some case howev it may still be valuabl to have avail an analysi of the result of particular trial eg to provid data on the like effect of a drug for purpos of weigh risk against like benefit to studi subject the propos would requir final clinic studi report to be submit within 90 day of a request from fda but provid for except under extraordinari circumst 6 clinic hold section 312 42 current allow fda to delay a propos clinic investig or to suspend an ongo investig under certain circumst under the propos fda would amend 312 42 to allow the agenc to place an investig on clinic hold if the sponsor fail to submit a special safeti summari or final clinic studi report if the same or a close relat drug is the subject of a concurr investig conduct by the same sponsor propos 312 42 b 1 v would requir safeti summari from all investig or the agenc could place ani of the investig on clinic hold fda believ this is appropri becaus data from all studi involv the drug or close relat drug may help fda evalu the safeti of each studi 7 termin fda is also propos in 312 44 b 1 viii to amend the regul regard termin so that failur to submit a semiannu report would be ground for termin an ind failur to submit an annual report is alreadi ground for termin an ind and fda is awar of no reason whi semiannu and annual report should be treat differ in this matter fda consid that failur to implement an adequ safeti monitor and evalu program as describ in propos 21 cfr 312 56 c would be ground for either a clinic hold under 312 42 or a termin of the ind under 312 44 sinc failur to have a program in place would mean that h uman subject are or would be expos to an unreason and signific risk of

time this articl is read by bungei shunju reader the tension will probabl be at it peak in the argument over whether or not the issu of econom sanction against the dprk should be refer to the un secur council unsc in fact sinc the latter day of the hosokawa regim the japanes govern at the instruct of the prime minist offic has been conduct a full scale confidenti simul by assembl sever relat ministri and govern agenc this has not been public at all the scale of the task forc is so huge that a staff member of the prime minist offic comment that it was the first time sinc the end of world war ii that so mani ministri and agenc have been assembl strict control of inform has prevent word of it leak out the top secret intern document obtain by the writer of this articl was compil by a japanes govern agenc and is titl in refer to the effect of econom and militari sanction against the dprk more than 30 page long the confidenti paper was compil last novemb long befor the prime minist offic issu it specif instruct it is howev extrem interest becaus the paper outlin the present govern simul the analysi was made into such wide field as econom sanction militari sanction reaction of various domest organ and so on reveal serious secur problem face japan let me introduc the content 1 effect of and reaction to econom sanction 1 predict form of econom sanction the follow action may be consid by the secur council under the author grant by articl 41 of the un charter name complet or partial interrupt of econom relat and of rail sea air postal telegraph radio and other mean of communic first suspens of japan dprk trade second a ban on all traffic of peopl and the entri of dprk ship into japanes port third sever of fund remitt rout to the dprk fourth restrict on communic by telegraph and telephon between japan and the dprk among these the first second and third are consid like to be effect as econom sanction against the dprk so we will now look at the effect these measur could inflict on dprk and the reaction to them by dprk and chosen soren north korean resid associ in japan 2 effect of econom sanction a if japan dprk trade is ban complet trade between japan and the dprk in 1992 regist 44 billion yen in favor of the dprk 28 3 billion yen in export to the dprk and 32 7 billion yen in import from the dprk in the last six year japan dprk trade has been in favor of dprk it is an import mean of obtain valuabl foreign exchang for the dprk and a mean of procur good and materi difficult to produc domest when measur are taken to ban japan dprk trade it is predict the follow effect will be seen last year figur reveal that the major commod export from japan to the dprk were textil for spin and textil product about 27 percent of the total export follow by machineri which made up about 18 percent electr machineri and tool which compris about 11 percent and transport machineri and tool which made up about 8 percent of singl item various textil aerial pump and compressor automobil and agricultur chemic were the leader on the export list if the dprk was unabl to import such item it export of cloth to japan use japanes textil materi would ceas and the dprk economi would come to a standstil through the lack of machineri transport equip and tool stop the import of agricultur chemic would great escal damag to dprk agricultur which is alreadi suffer from noxious insect on the other hand there is almost no foodstuff or fuel export from japan to the dprk and if trade was suspend there would be littl effect on the dprk as far as these item are concern howev when north korean live in japan travel to the dprk and dprk ship visit japanes port they take out of japan a consider quantiti of foodstuff and fuel which do not appear on the custom statist when ship and peopl are prohibit from move between the two countri it will have a certain effect see subsect b in case travel is ban and dprk ship are prevent from enter japanes port in addit trade firm affili with chosen soren have long been suspect of export cocom prohibit contraband good to the dprk via third countri if this is true sanction will not be effect unless export to third countri by chosen soren affili trade compani are stop in addit an increas watchdog system may be necessari to prevent smuggl and secret transact by sea writer note 1 when impos econom sanction the dprks oil suppli situat is a major factor the biggest concern of the japanes us and rok govern in impos econom sanction is the threat of militari adventur on the part of dprk in order to prevent it stop oil import which provid the fuel for armor troop and militari aircraft is an absolut condit us and rok militari sourc differ in their assess of the dprk oil stockpil with some guess that the dprk has fortifi underground oil storag dump although no figur are avail western diplomat sourc in seoul share the view that the dprk probabl has six month worth of reserv in store mani expert therefor point out that dprk troop are like to invad when they are left with onli three to four month suppli of oil judg from it abil to wage war dprk export nodong 1 or scud c ballist missil and other small calib firearm to middl east countri includ iran and syria in exchang for import of oil from these countri use a sea blockad to prevent freighter carri on this trade requir not onli vigil but power militari strength the term sea blockad is easili use in the press but in japan there is littl recognit that this is the final stage of econom sanction mean a state of war on top of this there is the littl known fact that violat and attempt to violat cocom coordin committe for multilater export control embargo on dprk have frequent taken place in the past for instanc in septemb 1988 the vice chairman of the korean associ of commerc and industri in japan was prosecut for deceiv the japanes author into think he was send cloth aboard ss samjiyon leav niigata while he was in fact load more than 30 corrug cardboard box fill with over a 1 000 nec person comput and integr chip which were subject to cocom embargo the incid was seen as part of organ crime commit by chosen soren and other in march 1987 a fals applic was submit to the ministri of intern trade and industri for a permit to export 700 comput to indonesia it was discov that the export was intend for dprk via singapor and the applic was turn down it must be point out that chosen soren util it subordin organ in method send a larg number of book on high technolog and that the subordin associ of scienc and technolog of north korean in japan has under it fold member engag in high advanc technolog and leader who are specialist and have been train by the japanes author in nuclear physic end of note b in case travel is ban and the entri of dprk ship into japanes port is ban last year an aggreg total of about 6 600 north korean visit the dprk from japan and by august this year about 1 800 had made the visit about 4 300 japanes visit dprk last year dprk ship made a total of 510 entri to japanes port last year when korean resid in japan affili with chosen soren visit dprk they ship cloth automobil and so on to the dprk as part of their handcarri luggag treat as travel good and good sent under separ cover automobil and other recogn as daili use item by the sender aboard dprk ship that make port call in japan aboard such ship last year about 32 ton of rice the maximum quantiti a person can take out of japan is 100 kilogram and a larg quantiti of sugar soy sauc cook salt automobil person comput and so on they are exclud from custom statist were sent to the dprk as takusohin consign item sent care of the captain and other to be use individu by the consigne most such good were either intend as gift for various organ in the dprk or were sent to relat of those visit the countri if visit to the dprk by north korean in japan and the entri of dprk ship into japanes port were ban it would affect the work of various dprk organ and the daili live of those who have repatri from japan approxim 93 000 peopl among the japanes who visit the dprk last year about 600 were engag in either trade negoti or technic counsel japan rank second after china as a dprk foreign trade partner and the major of the timeworn plant facil in the dprk which have been brought in from japan need frequent repair and check if visit by japanes technician were restrict it presum plant oper would be affect a great deal about 3 000 japanes tourist visit dprk last year and this year about 600 have visit so far it is said that a japanes tourist spend about 50 000 yen while in dprk so it is estim that the dprk earn about 150 million yen annual in tourism revenu the japanes constitut the largest number of tourist to dprk and a ban of their travel would certain affect the dprks foreign exchang earn dprk vessel load sever time the volum of crude oil need for the voyag claim the oil as good need follow departur from japanes port and let chosen soren affili trade compani pay the bill assum the 510 dprk ship that enter japanes port last year load crude oil in quantiti more than actual requir sever hundr thousand ton of crude oil are suppos to have been transport into the dprk ban dprk ship from enter japanes port will result in a lack of fuel requir for voyag of these vessel c in case rout of fund remitt are close although the dprks foreign exchang reserv have not been made public it is presum that countri is in an extrem serious situat in view of the fact that the dprk has not succeed in revers it deficit figur in foreign trade and that it method of trade transact with china and russia has chang from the barter system to settlement by intern currenc in view of this a constant flow of fund from japan to the dprk trade payment contribut from chosen soren and so on is one of the dprks major sourc of foreign exchang the amount of money sent to the dprk from japan as invest in dprk compani exceed 30 million yen for which a report to the ministri of financ is requir credit in excess of 10 million yen for non busi purpos for which a report is also requir and contribut or gift exceed 5 million yen except among famili member total approxim 13 billion yen in 1989 about 130 million yen in 1990 and about 260 million yen in 1991 in addit about 32 7 billion yen was remit to the dprk as trade payment between the two countri last year these payment constitut an extrem small part of the remitt from japan to the dprk if the payment not requir to be report to the financ ministri are count a consider larg amount of money is presum to be sent to the dprk through bank thus the dprk will be dealt with a big blow if remitt to the dprk through bank are prohibit as for the japanes bank which have sign correspond transact agreement with dprk bank see the diagram below diagram 1 to be sent separ in addit the tokai bank ltd the daiwa bank ltd the hokkaido takushoku bank ltd the hokuriku bank ltd the industri bank of japan ltd the long term credit bank of japan ltd the mitsubishi trust and bank corpor the mitsui trust and bank co ltd and the central bank for agricultur and forestri sign correspond contract with the foreign trade bank of the dprk chosen soren make enorm contribut for various dprk celebr and bring an averag of 1 million yen for each visitor to the dprk as aid money for relat live in the dprk 5 million yen per person is the maximum amount one can take out of japan the organiz and individu contribut by chosen soren report amount to a total of 60 to 70 billion yen these contribut includ amount not requir to be report to the ministri of financ and amount sent to the dprk via third countri or remit skill conceal in export good to the dprk some north korean live in japan are suspect of take more money than allow as the maximum amount with them to the dprk by skill scatter and conceal them in their luggag in order to cut off remitt by chosen soren to the dprk therefor it is necessari to examin such measur as step up check into remitt via third countri and more sever inspect of good export to the dprk restrict travel to the dprk and lower the ceil on the amount of money that can be taken out of japan writer note 2 when korean live in japan remit money to their famili in the dprk without give specif reason for do so leader of the korean associ of commerc and industri in japan conced that befor famili receiv the money about 30 percent is taken off the top under various pretext by the dprk author more serious problem exist as well becaus mani of the leader of the associ are age anxieti is spread among them that the dprk govern may exact portion of the enorm estat left by them when their famili attempt to bequeath the fortun in fact a daughter in japan and a son in the dprk are in legal disput over a inherit follow the death of their father an import associ member from mito citi ibaragi prefectur it is said that the dprk author are behind the court disput the writer has a classifi document on hand entitl list of those who made larg contribut the list say that lead businessmen includ oper of pachinko relat busi are make larg contribut more than 100 million yen a person on such occas as kim il song birthday everyon associ with the chosen soren know this writer note 2 continu accord to a simul conduct at the ministri of financ ban payment freez remitt receipt and payment so call freez of asset defin in articl 16 of the foreign exchang law will be amend from a licens system notic payment not author which provid for ban grant of foreign credit and ban direct invest will be regul by ordin of the ministri of financ prepar are under way to issu a joint amend with the ministri of intern trade and industri for ordin which provid for ban provid servic and labor but mani japanes govern expert say in unison that it is imposs to complet stop the remitt by north korean live in japan for exampl it is said to be imposs to get hold of remitt when a north korean resid in japan send money to an account in a swiss bank access onli by a secret identif number or an account open under a foreign name or dprk diplomat carri money with them or money sent by diplomat pouch via third countri in recent day there are mani instanc of remit money to the dprk after collect it oversea rather than direct remit it from japan end of note 3 reaction of the dprk and chosen soren a the dprk domest reaction when concern nation impos econom sanction in accord with a unit nation resolut demand econom sanction against the dprk the follow trend are consid possibl frequent riot may occur due to food shortag it has so far been report that the dprk has wit riot due to food shortag serious food shortag may spread onc econom sanction are impos if riot take place continu throughout the countri and are organ as a form of outrag against the present system they may quit possibl lead to the collaps of the present regim in order to avoid such a situat the dprk parti and govern will tighten it control of peopl thought and step up arrest and imprison of rebel exodus of dprk resid it is thought that when the domest economi of the dprk becom impoverish and food shortag becom wors due to econom sanction case of dprk resid escap to china or russia or attempt to seek asylum in the rok will occur but the number of such case may be small unless the dprks current system collaps the dprk parti and govern are expect to strengthen border patrol to prevent such action from occur in larg number seek assist from friend nation the dprk may seek assist from china to overcom econom sanction bilater trade between china and the dprk is about 700 million dollar of this the frontier trade between the dprk and china three northeast provinc amount to 100 million furthermor smuggl is report to be rampant along the border between the two countri if the dprk can acquisit vital good such as oil and food from china make good use of geograph advantag econom sanction cannot expect to yield result therefor as long as china doe not go along with econom sanction and show a cooper respons econom sanction may be less effect request for chosen soren assist the dprk may request that chosen soren help acquir materi and provid foreign exchang for chosen soren to carri this out while send materi and money from japan to the dprk is ban it may resort to smuggl or send materi via third countri in order to avoid japanes safeguard there is a possibl that the dprk may attempt to take over a total of approxim 2 400 billion yen held by the chosen credit union in japan an organ subordin to the chosen soren by claim that the money belong to the dprk declin of militari strength the dprk may face difficulti in maintain it militari strength due to the declin moral of it soldier caus in addit to food shortag by shortag of fuel for aircraft battleship and militari vehicl militari repuls the dprk may attempt to keep up a stubborn postur extern and attempt to solidifi the peopl uniti by put the countri in a semi warlik state order in march this year in reaction to team spirit a joint us rok militari exercis when the situat develop into such a state that the domest economi goe complet broke and the system face a crisi it is expect to threaten concern countri by test launch missil and concentr it troop along the border in order to impli that continu econom sanction are danger also it cannot be deni that the dprk would be prepar to launch missil and may actual attack ship on watch duti at sea if concern nation impos a sea blockad in order to maxim the effect of econom sanction countermeasur against japan the dprk announc the follow countermeasur when the japanes govern impos sanction against the dprk follow the bomb of a korean air passeng plane 1 dprk diplomat will ceas all contact with japanes diplomat 2 japan nation public servic personnel and pro govern person are ban from enter the dprk 3 when japanes fish boat illeg trespass in the dprks exclus econom zone their fishermen will be punish accord to law the abov mention measur could be an acknowledg of the effect basic caus by the sanction measur impos by the japanes govern which japan enforc in a passiv manner therefor the dprk is expect to respond to the japanes govern imposit of econom sanction measur such as sever econom and person exchang with our countri in concret form these are presum to be as follow stop payment on trade liabil approxim 90 percent of japan dprk trade is handl by busi and firm oper by north korean live in japan therefor these busi and compani are expect to be driven into financi difficulti ban fish insid the dprks exclus econom zone fish insid the exclus econom zone may be ban and either abrog or refus to renew the privat fish agreement between japan and the dprk to expir on decemb 31 this year will be consid even if fish insid the econom zone is not prohibit it is expect that japanes fish boat may be illeg apprehend detain and sever punish break off intergovernment negoti the dprk steadfast maintain the postur that it would not respond to japan dprk normal negoti as long as the japanes side insist on a solut to the nuclear issu as a precondit the dprk may reiter it inflex posit for domest consumpt so the peopl can see their govern resolut stanc rather than impos sanction against japan restrict of human traffic japanes have been restrict from enter the dprk sinc late may this year when such restrict will be cancel is not known if the dprks restrict on visit by japanes are not cancel by the time econom sanction are impos such restrict will continu b chosen soren if japan start to impos econom sanction against the dprk chosen soren is expect to bring up the issu of the suspens of human traffic as a humanitarian problem chosen soren will demand the cancel of sanction and stage furious protest activ at japanes govern organ unit nation agenc in japan and the us embassi in this event it is possibl that certain outlaw element may commit violenc against those on watch duti and illeg destroy and inflict damag on relat facil these element are also expect to react excess to critic from the mass media and right wing organ oppos the dprk and to launch violent counterattack follow the dprks announc of it intent to withdraw from the nuclear nonprolifer treati npt chosen soren insist that the organ must wholeheart support the dprk peopl who are stage a heroic struggl to defend their fatherland and to build up their economi it sent foodstuff and cloth to the dprk peopl armi and made enorm contribut on such occas as the birthday of presid kim il song the 40th anniversari of the ceasefir of the korean war the found anniversari of the worker parti of korea and so on in addit it is send versatil product facil and tool to the dprk these includ a vaccin product plant to prevent type b hepat which is said to be spread due to food and sanit problem and the mankyongda cloth plant which has been set up to earn foreign exchang while the intern communiti is hot debat the possibl of econom sanction follow the dprks declar to withdraw from the nuclear nonprolifer treati central cadr have been tell local chapter that we have to support the economi of the dprk even by illegitim mean in case econom sanction are impos against the republ in this connect chosen soren is expect to further step up it support of the dprk economi even if econom sanction are appli sinc it is on record as violat cocom restrict it is fair predict that again it will use similar illegitim method to take out money and materi from japan writer note 3 chosen soren chairman han dok su who is 87 year old and has held the organ number one posit for near 40 year sudden visit the dprk in late april until recent day he was hospit and grow weak due to breath difficulti and dim conscious caus by problem with his thyroid gland he is thought to have gone home forev this time so it is said that chosen soren will be engulf by a power struggl in the futur proper speak first vice chairman yi chin kyu is the closest to the chairmanship by rank order but in realiti ho chong man vice chairman in charg and a cadr among the top leader of the commerc and industri associ is far ahead in reach true hegemoni in chosen soren it is expect that an intern struggl will continu until a general meet is held next year what matter is the fact that vice chairman ho chong man has broad connect in the japanes polit world and has engag in activ lobbi among influenti diet member concern the issu of econom sanction against the dprk it is fear that polit maneuv is be stage in favor of the dprk end of note 2 effect and reaction of militari sanction 1 predict form of militari sanction as for militari sanction against the dprk the secur council is given such author by articl 42 of the unit nation charter action by air sea or land forc as may be necessari to maintain or restor intern peac and secur includ demonstr blockad and other oper in theori the follow action are consid possibl 1 coercion by deploy of militari strength such as conduct larg scale maneuv 2 sea blockad to maintain the effect of econom sanction 3 attack by exclus use of aircraft and missil 3 1 limit attack against nuclear develop relat facil and missil base 3 2 limit attack to elimin the dprks suprem leader 3 3 larg scale attack to make the dprks militari strength powerless 4 an allout invas by land sea and air forc to occupi either partial or the whole territori of the dprk among the realist possibl measur that can be taken against the dprk in relat to the nuclear issu are 1 2 3 1 and 3 2 next the effect these measur will have on the dprk and the reaction of the dprk and chosen soren against them will be examin 2 effect of militari sanction a if either measur 1 coercion by forc or measur 2 sea blockad mention abov is adopt the dprk will inevit have to strengthen it combat mobil readi to the highest level in order to resist such a measur in that case the dprk will presum mobil it massiv organ of men in the reserv and militia thought to be approxim 4 5 million men about one fifth of the whole popul and addit redeploy a consider number of regular peopl armi troop who have been dispatch to mani sector of the economi includ construct site from product to the militari field to step up combat mobil readi when that occur the econom sector will have to bear a serious burden and if the situat drag on for a long time shoulder the burden of maintain combat mobil readi is expect to becom unbear for the economi which is alreadi in a wretch situat and face mani difficulti if this situat turn out to be a realiti it is consid possibl that critic from everi social stratum will pour out against secretari kim chong il who is reput to be the planner as well as promot of the stubborn foreign polici for invit such a situat meanwhil incit by extern threat chauvinist as well as nationalist sentiment may well be enhanc at the same time it is therefor difficult to determin whether the dprk leadership author will immedi becom shaki b if measur 3 1 attack on nuclear facil and so on mention abov is adopt the unit state will most like launch or lead limit bomb on specif facil and the oper will probabl be high success militarili destroy the target with minor damag to the attack when the unit state and the dprks militari hardwar is compar under these circumst secretari kim chong il who recent assum the most respons militari posit in the dprk will suffer an inevit fall in his author in combin with an inquiri into who is respons for bring about the result of pursu a stubborn foreign polici critic of kim chong il may surfac in addit the militari will onc again be arous to recogn the poor qualiti of it equip and lead cadr may critic the whole militari polici center around parti led thought c if measur 3 2 attack on the suprem leader mention abov is adopt the unit state has a past record of carri out militari action bomb and missil attack appar intend to elimin kill the suprem leader of libya and iraq it cannot be deni that similar militari action may be taken against the dprk base on the understand that the elimin of both kim il song and kim chong il might hope bring about a chang in that countri polit system as past experi show howev these oper did not accomplish their object and it is high unpredict as to which of the follow result will be brought about if the oper is launch a both kim il song and kim chong il die b kim il song surviv while kim chong il die c kim il song die while kim chong il surviv d both kim il song and kim chong il surviv in the case of a as a short term effect nation uniti will be solidifi as the result of anger at the kill of their leader but after the excit die down a success struggl for leadership will take place follow the loss of absolut centripet forc the author of the parti and govern will be gone thus develop a situat in which the possibl of the regim collaps is undeni in the case of b the confus envisag in case a will not occur immedi becaus kim il song is aliv but in consider of kim il song advanc age it is inevit that unrest will occur among the leadership with respect to expect revolv around the success problem moreov consider unrest can be anticip becaus there would be no immedi successor on the death of kim il song such as kim chong il who has been prepar over a long time in the case of c it is expect that the effect of solidifi uniti center around kim chong il will occur in this case there is high probabl that ask kim chong il to take respons as suprem militari leader as mention earlier will not surfac immedi becaus indign over the kill of kim il song will surpass consider of the former in the case of d the author of kim chong il as suprem militari leader will be promot and there is a consider strong possibl that it may serv to strengthen the system becaus propaganda then becom possibl claim the enemi attack has been repuls on top of domest indign over such an attack writer note 4 anoth factor to be taken into consider is the health of 88 year old presid kim il song in spite of various rumor littl data is avail the clinic record of kim il song whom a former east german secret polic surgeon examin in pyongyang were made avail in the west after the cold war came to an end accord to them presid kim il song is suffer from hear difficulti high blood pressur and heart troubl which requir the aid of a pacemak the well known goiter behind his neck photograph and televis imag intent do not to show it has becom larger late and it remov is imposs becaus the blood vessel within it are veri complex it has been diagnos as a benign tumor end of note 3 the dprk and chosen soren respons and their effect on japan a the dprk a form of respons from an outsid perspect the dprk has frequent taken unpredict action and it is therefor extrem difficult to forecast how it will respond if emerg measur such as sanction are taken but theoret it general respons are presum flexibl realist respons to settl the nuclear issu will be shown in the make of new compromis propos reopen of interrupt negoti and so on propaganda by step up extern propaganda to stress the dprk is a victim of us power polici and make appeal to win the sympathi of world opinion it will aim at stop sanction from be impos threat it will make public that the dprk will launch appropri arm retali against concern nation the rok japan and the like if sanction measur such as the sea blockad are not suspend this is aim at appli pressur on the concern countri to win the suspens of sanction terror let dprk agent foreign rok citizen and north korean live abroad engag in terrorist activ against the countri involv in sanction with the dprks involv in such scheme remain hidden this is aim at win the suspens of sanction and retali there may be occas when both propaganda and threat are use at the same time retali limit militari retaliatori action missil attack on specif area for exampl to a degre correspond to sanction will be taken war in declar the dprk deem sanction a declar of war it will begin an allout arm invas of the rok b various sanction and predict respons the respons list abov will be specif made in respons to the form of sanction taken and they are as follow in the case of measur 1 arm threat or measur 2 sea blockad the dprk is expect to main carri out propaganda and at time it will be mix with threat and terrorist act to shake up intern opinion and have sanction cancel in the end but if sanction are impos for an extend period of time and the domest economi is driven to an unbear difficult state there is a chanc of flexibl regard measur 3 1 attack on nuclear facil there is a high probabl the dprk base on the judgment that arm retali increas the possibl of far larger attack from oppon and lead to a crisi in the system will attempt to wage a propaganda war to win the sympathi of intern opinion thus restor it author but if the dprk come to the conclus that such a lukewarm respons will not recov it fallen author and put down discont among the militari the possibl of it choos terror and retali cannot be elimin regard measur 3 2 attack on the suprem leader the result of the attack will produc vari respons general speak the more serious the unrest within the system the greater the possibl it will react violent in despair on the other hand if the system stabil is maintain a self control respons is expect in place of a radic one c effect on japan if the dprk show the abov mention respons japan will be affect in the follow way propaganda if some sort of sanction are impos on the dprk includ real militari attack a sea blockad and arm coercion and japan is involv in some way especi if they allow us forc in japan to use their base to assist such measur season pro dprk element as well as a consider larg forc consist of so call peac love organ and so on within japan are expect to show a critic respons there is a great possibl dprk propaganda will win a consider amount of sympathi and support within domest opinion threat if us base in japan are use in a sea blockad and arm coercion against the dprk and the dprk make it clear that these base will be attack by forc includ missil unless the use of the base is stop it is possibl that the abov mention group will assert japan will be drag into a war make appeal to stop japan involv in militari sanction and they will be support by resid on the peripheri of the base thus divid nation opinion terror if the dprk carri out terrorist action in japan it will like 1 dispatch dprk agent 2 util south and north korean in japan under it influenc or 3 hire intern terrorist organ in view of the charact of japanes societi which has experienc hard ani terrorist threat and exist secur prepared the dprks action will be compar easi to execut the ensu human and materi loss will be heavi and serious social unrest will follow retali regard arm attack against japan the dprk is suppos abl to 1 launch nodong type missil 2 conduct air bomb 3 use submarin to intercept and attack japanes ship and 4 launch armi troop to land on japanes soil of these item 2 3 and 4 have a low possibl of success when the dprks militari capabl is compar with japan defens capabl realist speak it is high inconceiv they will be adopt but as to item 1 japan has no effect defens method as general discuss and if the missil are load with chemic warhead there will be heavi damag war if larg scale hostil break out on the korean peninsula needless to say japan will be subject to direct and indirect effect includ a larg influx of refuge b chosen soren chosen soren is expect to launch a multitud of propaganda critic of sanction whatev form they may take it will presum stage furious protest action includ demonstr march to japanes govern organ the us embassi in japan and us forc facil in japan and in that process activist carri away by passion may conceiv attempt to break into build en bloc or assault guard sinc march this year when tension start to mount in connect with the dprk chosen soren began make repeat appeal to member of haksup cho studi unit an organiz entiti of the worker parti of korea consist of activist over 18 year of age who pledg absolut allegi to kim il song and kim chong il father and son to uncondit support the instruct given by secretari kim chong il and to live or die with the secretari in this connect it is high probabl that mass violenc and disturb will occur like dure the time of minchong the democrat front for unif of the korea in japan as the result of high elat anti japanes and anti us sentiment if militari sanction mention abov in 3 or 4 are impos especi if presid kim il song and secretari kim chong il are kill it is undeni that under dprk instruct chosen soren will resort to retaliatori action includ terror howev it is also high conceiv that unrest will spread within the organ and more and more activist and member will leav when critic mount as chosen soren resort to organ and premedit subvers violenc becaus about 90 percent of member are second through fourth generat born and rais in japan confront between the radic group center around the studi unit and the group critic of violenc is expect and this may develop into intern split other detail omit writer note an import problem complet left out in japanes mass media report is panic as the confidenti paper point out japanes societi has hard ever experienc terrorist threat and it is not an exagger to say that panic is a characterist trait of the japanes as one of the dprks method is to caus panic through small scale terror and militari attack japan need to have risk manag at the prime minist offic simul are be consid by three agenc the

describ in product label lavi assum that quinin was taken for leg cramp approxim one quarter of the year by each subject by divid the total day of therapi purchas by the total day use per person lavi estim the size of the popul expos to drug product contain quinin in 1987 to be 66 x 106 and calcul the incid of qiitp to be 1 case per 415 000 peopl base upon 4 case report to fda that year lavi did not tri to correct for underreport use anoth approach lavi report that quinin has been estim to be the causat agent in approxim 10 percent of all drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia report he note that secondari thrombocytopenia was the princip diagnosi in approxim 4 000 discharg in the 1987 nation hospit discharg survey assum that 10 percent of these thrombocytopenia case were drug induc and 10 percent of drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia case are relat to quinin 40 case could be attribut to quinin assum the popul expos to drug product contain quinin in 1987 was 66 x 106 as calcul

the blood center of southeastern wisconsin over a 10 year period in make this estim it was assum that at least half of all case occur in this popul would have been refer to the laboratori for confirm of diagnosi the agenc note that the estim of the incid of thrombocytopen reaction to drug product contain quinin rang from more than 1 in 1 000 for quinin and quinidin consid togeth to less than 1 in 400 000 this wide rang suggest that a precis estim will be hard to obtain it is difficult to conclud howev that the first estim propos by lavi is correct the number of event use by lavi is the number report to fda in 1987 while no one know the extent of underreport it is believ to be veri substanti for exampl if even a 1 percent rate is assum this would translat use lavi other figur to about 1 in 4 000 peopl the exposur estim could also be consider in error lavi assum the drug was use for one quarter of the year by each person if in fact it was use for one half of the year the number of expos peopl would be half that propos and the rate of drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia would be doubl that calcul the incid calcul base on the nation hospit discharg survey ref 1 employ the estim of popul discuss abov and assum 1 percent of the diagnos of secondari thrombocytopenia were attribut to quinin there is no way to know the accuraci of this estim if it were higher even by a factor of 5 the estim rate would be abov 1 in 10 000 a substanti rate probabl the most credibl of lavi estim is the puget sound base estim ref 2 becaus it is base on hospit diagnos and well document exposur the estim of the incid of qiitp base on the number of document case occur in the popul serv by the blood center of southeastern wisconsin over a 10 year period ref 3 also is base on relat few assumpt and appear reliabl the onli assumpt in this calcul was that twice as mani event occur as were report to the laboratori the estim from these two sourc 1 848 puget sound and 1 3 300 southeastern wisconsin are similar to the estim of 1 1 000 cite by mitchel ref 4 these three sourc provid a reason small rang for the incid of qiitp that can be expect about 1 1 000 to 1 3 000 therefor while the agenc

assign to the treatment sequenc on the basi of a predetermin random schedul prior to enter the baselin period therefor the remov of subject from the studi in the first 2 week for not have enough event may have bias the studi in the statist analysi of the studi data three efficaci variabl were evalu the mean frequenc of leg cramp per night the mean sever of leg cramp per night and the total number

report form from which these variabl are deriv the subject overal assess of the effect of the drug was collect but not analyz sixti two of the 75 subject enrol in the studi were includ in the data analysi of the 13 subject found to be unevalu 8 withdrew from the studi on their own accord no specif reason for these withdraw were given but it is state in the studi report that they were unrel to

treat the unblind baselin and washout period as if they were treatment period this type of analysi is incorrect for a crossov trial the relev comparison that should be made are between the treatment in the doubl blind period possibl with adjust for baselin provid there are no major chang in baselin valu for each period when patel joint test for equal carryov and equal pretreat sever ref 7 is appli to the data howev signific differ are seen in pretreat sever befor the second period analysi of the second period is thus compromis therefor analysi should be limit to the first treatment period week 3 and 4 this comparison doe not show a signific advantag for quinin sulfat over placebo for ani of the effect variabl anoth clinic studi ref 4 use the same studi design as the studi discuss abov except that the dose of quinin sulfat was 260 mg night not the 325 mg night use in the first studi in addit five efficaci variabl were analyz frequenc sever and durat of leg cramp and induct and

were perform the result of this studi are not adequ to support the effect of quinin sulfat for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp the studi by jone and castleden ref 5 also doe not provid adequ evid of quinin sulfat effect for this indic the studi was a doubl blind crossov studi of nine patient with four 2 week period of observ a run in period and a washout period in addit to two treatment period of placebo or quinin sulfat 300 mg day the same five efficaci valu as in the second studi abov were evalu frequenc sever and durat of leg cramp and induct and qualiti of sleep no raw data were includ to substanti ani of the statist claim made by the author nor was a protocol includ in the articl of the five primari efficaci variabl onli sever of cramp was claim to show a signific differ between quinin sulfat and placebo p 025 although an analysi of frequenc of cramp after 2 am was also claim to be signific p 025 there was no indic that the time period after 2 am was identifi in the protocol as defin a primari endpoint thus this is assum to be a post hoc analysi done after review the data in general the isol sever find is not convinc on it face in addit the publish articl did not provid suffici inform to permit an independ analysi of the data for these reason the studi doe not provid evid that quinin sulfat is an effect treatment for nocturn leg muscl cramp three studi ref 1 2 and 6 were submit to support the effect of quinin sulfat and vitamin e individu and in combin for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp the freiburg studi ref 1 was a 5 week doubl blind random crossov studi in 24 subject all subject receiv placebo dure week 1 baselin week 3 and week 5 subject in group i receiv quinin in week 2 and the combin of quinin

sulfat was report but no differ in durat or sever of attack was found between these two activ treatment the report describ an obvious improv in frequenc durat and sever of attack between the placebo period and both activ treatment but no statist evid or analysi to support this conclus was provid moreov the comparison of treatment and placebo did not involv random patient group nor was it blind onli the portion of the studi compar the combin product versus quinin was a random doubl blind trial the studi report did not includ the studi protocol detail of the statist analysi conduct or individu subject data the model describ in the summari of the data analysi did not proper separ carryov effect from treatment effect the studi provid no evid from a control trial that quinin is effect

conclud that quinin sulfat alon and in combin with vitamin e at a daili dose of approxim 260 mg was safe and effect in the short term 1 week treatment of nocturn leg muscl cramp the agenc find that there were a number of flaw in the analysi of this studi first the primari endpoint number of night per week with leg cramp appear to have been arbitrarili chosen after the studi was complet none of the efficaci variabl was declar the primari endpoint in the protocol second the studi was of 2 week durat and there was no provis in the protocol for separ evalu of the data from week 1 and week 2 thus there is no basi for the decis to analyz week 1 and week 2 separ in the absenc of such an analysi declar prospect in the protocol in fact an analysi of both week togeth see below doe not show a signific benefit of quinin third an adjust for multipl comparison should have been includ in the data analysi given seven variabl two activ treatment and at least three time point at which data could be analyz first week second week both week the nomin signific differ between treatment at the end of week one would not be expect to retain statist signific if an adjust for multipl comparison were includ in the analysi even consid the retrospect identifi primari endpoint a correct for three look week 1 week 2 and togeth would at least doubl the nomin p valu even without correct for multipl the result do not support the conclus that quinin sulfat and vitamin e alon or in combin are effect for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp first week 2 result fail to replic the result of week 1 no differ between ani of the treatment group for ani paramet were found at the end of week 2 nor was the investig global assess conduct at the end of the 2 week doubl blind period abl to differenti between treatment second a signific treatment by center interact was found for the report superior of quinin sulfat over placebo in week 1 in reduc the number of night per week with leg cramp the result was driven by two of nine center in one of these center the combin product was indistinguish from placebo and in the other the superior of placebo over the combin near statist signific p 10 thus in the two clinic respons for the favor week 1 result of treatment with quinin there was a failur to replic the result report with quinin sulfat alon vitamin e was ineffect in all paramet measur throughout the studi the four retrospect declar secondari endpoint for which statist signific reduct were report in week 1 in the quinin sulfat group compar to placebo were 1 the number of cramp per night 2 the number of night with sleep difficulti 3 the sever of the cramp and 4 the durat of the cramp although a consist benefit on these endpoint would render a find on the primari endpoint more persuas as with the primari efficaci endpoint none of the differ between activ treatment and placebo persist through to the end of week 2 for the reason discuss abov the post hoc week 1 analysi of these endpoint fail to provid convinc evid to support the efficaci of quinin sulfat for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp two addit analys of the result of the studi were submit ref 8 and 9 the first ref 8 was an analysi of the number of leg cramp per day for each day of the studi this analysi show occasion day in which quinin was superior to placebo but is on the whole not help given an entri cramp rate of one cramp episod per night for at least 3 night per week signific differ in ani endpoint would not be expect on a day by day ie noncumul evalu the second analysi ref 9 was of the total cramp rate mean number of cramp per day over the cours of the entir studi period for both the evalu subset of subject and the intent to treat popul two analys were perform on each group in one analysi onli those subject who complet the studi with at least 14 day of treatment the complet analysi were analyz while the other analysi involv the result from all subject with efficaci observ the endpoint analysi for the quinin sulfat and placebo treatment group in the endpoint analys where less than 14 day of treatment was complet leg cramp for the observ number of day were calcul and the mean was carri forward to 14 day none of the four analys reveal statist signific reduct in the mean number of leg cramp experienc dure 14 day of treatment in the quinin treat subject compar with placebo subject the endpoint analysi for evalu patient approach statist signific for quinin sulfat p 06 but the result of the complet analysi for evalu subject and both intent to treat analys were clear negat the total cramp rate over the entir studi is the most straightforward effect measur it did not show a drug effect on cramp while the favor trend on one analysi could suggest activ the studi was alreadi of veri substanti size and should have been abl to detect a clinic meaning respons this studi therefor doe not provid evid of efficaci of quinin
