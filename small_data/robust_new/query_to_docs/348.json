did mayb becaus the realiti is so mundan that exist on patrol is about drill and be tidi and listen for thing that you hope are not there clanci also serv to retail the myth of hi tech warrior to the men themselv life not so much imit art as simpli wish it did for both offic and men that mundan routin is much as it was in the old polari boat three shift work around the clock monitor the nuclear reactor listen at the sonar station for ani sign of ship or other submarin practis torpedo fire and the missil launch drill and cruis around at walk pace for the rest it eat sleep and wait for armageddon condit are at least somewhat easier on board than on previous submarin becaus the new fleet has to accommod the bigger trident missil vanguard is onli slight smaller than the invinc aircraft carrier and at the same time the crew is smaller than on previous boat as autom and a desir to save money have taken their toll still while it is possibl to walk around the boat without see anyon there is never a feel of be alon to give some privaci a person stereo is suppli to each crew man who can listen to music while lie on a bunk not much larger than a coffin the macabr feel is emphasis by the fact that mani of the rate bunk are pack in around the bottom of the missil silo in that sleep near death who know what dream shall come at about the size of a small second bedroom the wardroom cater for 15 offic is probabl the largest public space on the boat it most redeem aspect is the lack of pipework a featur omnipres elsewher and some soft furnish yet despit the best effort of the navi design it is imposs to suspend disbelief and imagin yourself away from this cramp place and this respons at heart vanguard is a nuclear tip sardin can with more than 100 men lock close togeth for month at a time everi nook and cranni is pack with electron equip everi ceil a sprawl of hydraul pipework the tang of the air is familiar to anyon who has been insid a power station or an engin workshop it is the metal bite of machin oil and the dri warmth of recondit oxygen there is a constant background hum from the nuclear reactor which is not so much heard as felt it soak up through the sole of your shoe this is a soulless place drift on a soulless mission the missil compart is surreal in the polari submarin they use to call it the forest with 16 tall trunk stretch along the compart stand among them stretch the imagin beyond break point could the content of these tube mean the end of human it goe without say that it take a particular kind of person to surviv three month squash insid a tin can wait for the unimagin the pressur from boredom and claustrophobia is obvious the weight of the sea abov flatten the soul yet there is also a paradox feel of agoraphobia thousand of mile of empti ocean stretch away on all side ad to the vertigo of hang two or three mile abov the sea bed whether the kind of person who can adjust to such condit is the right person to have a finger on the nuclear trigger would make a good psycholog final question stress is a problem more than one sub marin has had to be brought back from a polari patrol under sedat becaus he was unabl to cope with the psycholog demand it cannot help that not all of the submarin crew are volunt the submarin servic doe not have suffici applic so some have to be press into servic from other part of the navi even command boyd origin had ambit to be a naval pilot for all the navi proud histori of turn reluct recruit into a fight forc the demand which are be made now are unimagin to ani crew member who genuin contempl them that stress can onli increas as the gap between the rhetor of deterr and the likelihood of it be need to counter an overwhelm threat in the real world get wider handcuff hang readi to subdu anyon who cannot cope it infirmari retain a high stock of sedat the difficulti of match the real world to vanguard capabl is not confin to the crew for the royal navi the launch of this spank new deterr is also a slight awkward affair tension between the great power are at their lowest for 50 year while the us and russia are busi dismantl 80 per cent of their nuclear weapon this is not the best time for the uk to launch a hideous expens submarin fleet which substanti increas the number rang and accuraci of nuclear warhead britain can deliv in part the navi weaken rational for trident explain the search for a new role in deter those who might land the odd scud missil on the uk it is also behind the argument that noth much has chang and that russia could soon turn hostil again yet it is hard to hide the appar pointless of long and stress sea patrol to safeguard against a sneak attack which is not go to come perhap the boat is at sea becaus a trident submarin sit in
