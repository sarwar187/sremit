the govern much trumpet campaign to cut wait list might have reduc your chanc of have to wait two year for a routin oper mani peopl are still wait a year or more often in consider discomfort for non urgent procedur such as hip replac or hernia repair one of the commonest devic use to lower the cost of privat medic insur is the six week rule this mean that onc a consult has said you need to go to hospit you use the nhs if it has a wait list of less than six week for that oper but if the wait would be longer than six week you get privat treatment immedi the six week rule is howev one of the most misunderstood concept in insur mani peopl believ it mean they must wait six week for privat treatment the import thing to understand is that it mean you should never have to wait more than six week for treatment whether in the nhs or privat you must rememb though that sign up for privat cover is not go to help you jump the queue if you alreadi have a problem which need treatment medic cover is the same as ani other insur it is intend to pay out if the unexpect happen not for certainti if you have a medic problem alreadi most insur will accept you for cover but will exclud treatment for that condit or anyth relat to it either perman or for at least two year this provid a power incent to join a medic insur scheme while you are young and healthi and to stick with the same insur apart from the six week rule the other main cost cut method behind budget polici are annual cash limit the exclus of most outpati treatment and a limit choic of hospit some scheme includ all these element which can make them difficult to understand jan lawson of specialist intermediari privat health partnership emphasis the import of understand exact how a scheme work and what is cover when you join so as to avoid disappoint later both lawson and iren gallimor of medisur anoth specialist broker pick the norwich union person care scheme as a budget polici worth consid this polici is veri basic in that it exclud virtual all consult and treatment as an out patient but it doe not impos ani cash limit on in patient treatment and there is no wait period gallimor also like norwich express care six which is a comprehens polici with a six week rule unlik some six week polici it pay for consult befor it is clear whether you need privat hospit treatment but lawson general is wari of six week rule polici becaus so mani peopl find them confus exclus most insur have a similar list of basic exclus such as chronic or termin ill such as kidney failur and aid self inflict condit eg alcohol relat voluntari procedur vasectomi infertil treatment and run of the mill expens such as dentistri and spectacl other exclus can vari between insur and polici gallimor say two to watch for are psychiatr care and pregnanc complic mental ill is surpris common and has a wide definit if for exampl your teenag daughter develop the slimmer diseas anorexia a psychiatr exclus would come into effect healthi pregnanc is exclud by all but a hand of polici but complic are cover by some often with the proviso that 10 month must have elaps sinc the polici start as gallimor point out you dont get pregnanc wait list in the nhs but it can be reassur to know that if there are complic you can opt for privat care choic of hospit hospit accommod is usual grade a b or c accord to the standard of the privat room not the qualiti of medic care some privat hospit have onli grade a accommod while other offer a rang hospit charg for ancillari servic also vari so some polici use onli hospit with lower charg some budget polici are restrict to basic accommod while other offer a choic a few insur go by post code as hospit in london and other citi tend to be in the upper price bracket a 45 year old in central london would for exampl pay pound 43 73 a month for a norwich union expresscar six polici compar with pound 19 97 for someon live in a cheaper area if your post code is high rate you could opt for a polici with a choic of grade or with uniform rate for the whole countri wpa and norwich both have polici which use onli privat bed in nhs hospit anoth norwich scheme local care make you choos in advanc the one hospit where you could receiv treatment but offer you a list of about 43 around the countri other discount one tip from gallimor is to check if your employ or ani other group or organis of which you are a member has a group scheme which could give you a discount even holder of some credit card are elig for discount if you have no readi made group you could tri persuad colleagu friend or relat to form one sever insur offer no claim discount for each year you do not make a claim your premium is reduc by a set percentag this discourag peopl from make small claim which push up administr cost lawson think no claim discount are a good idea but caution that you should first check what the standard premium is some insur offer introductori discount of up to 30 per cent which mean that if you claim in the first year you could find your premium shoot up by that amount a more predict way of secur a discount is by agre to pay an excess a fix amount toward everi claim again this is intend to discourag small claim bupa has discount for fix excess of pound 100 pound 250 while ohra a dutch insur has a system which give discount of up to 37 5 per cent if you agre to pay up

through direct market a leaflet is sent with your bank or credit card statement or fall out of a magazin the problem here is know how what you are be offer compar with other cover avail lawson

fun at all when a seem simpl question about aid drew barrow into a nation controversi recent and one gay activist group in new york citi claim the mayflow madam had made a major faux pas the question was if a host invit a known carrier of aid to a dinner parti should he so inform his other guest barrow respond yes most peopl will know that they cannot contract the diseas by be seat at a dinner tabl with a carrier but it is a courtesi to all to let them know ahead of time as a result barrow was disinvit to the premier of a movi while her publish doubleday was ask to issu an apolog use languag not printabl in a famili newspap barrow fume that she had been the victim of a setup by a veri radic gay group that alway look for media attent how could i be disinvit to someth when i was never invit in the first place this whole thing is so person upset to me i cant tell you it a real nightmar as for what to do in the situat barrow still stick by her advic i have a huge number of gay friend and everi time ive ever been invit anywher i was alway told if there was somebodi with aid who was go to be there not becaus these peopl were tri to warn me but becaus they want other guest to have an extra level of sensit on the other hand both baldridg and martin didnt see the necess for tell anyon anyth at most respect dinner parti note miss manner there wouldnt be ani activ where you would catch aid so i dont see whi you should have to tell peopl but etiquett arbit charlott ford profess some confus as to what to do hmmm such a tough situat she murmur i think there are certain peopl who dont care and there are other peopl who would be just devast if they were at a parti with someon who had aid her solut she decid was simpli not to invit the person with aid to dinner which aid support group say is also wrong so whos right ami i honest dont know the onli thing im certain of is that by next week next month next year anoth social phenomenon will creat anoth conundrum for etiquett expert and ami you wont be here to help us through it what the offic etiquett when men and women work togeth judith martin the veri simpl rule that take care of most problem is that gender is simpli not relev in the workplac onc you realiz that then the question of who goe through the door first and who pay for lunch are veri easili settl it should be settl just as if it were an all male workplac by rank and posit charlott ford if i was a woman and invit to dinner by a male colleagu i would certain say let have lunch first i just wouldnt be avail for dinner pj orourk anyon who has good manner on the job probabl wont have that job long courtesi doe not belong in the workplac how do you ask a man to wear a condom letitia baldridg you can say to him im veri sorri but if you dont use a condom there just no way we can be togeth you can then give him some or tell him where the nearest drugstor is or tell him let have dinner anoth night and send him away martin if you know the person well enough to make that necessari you ought to be abl to say anyth what amus me is when peopl shift into pruderi if you are on intim term with somebodi sure you can ask them intim question ford id be a littl bit embarrass and a littl bit shi and say listen i hope youv taken some sort of protect becaus i dont want to contract ani diseas and im sure you dont either sydney biddl barrow it is not seem nor necessari to smile on the first date and say love your dress by the way will you be give me a fatal diseas instead allow time to pass that what these date are for after all by the time sex seem a possibl you will have necessarili both cross that line beyond which these sensit issu may be discuss if your give a dinner parti and invit someon who has aid should you tell your other guest baldridg i dont think you tell anybodi that the person has aid becaus frank the guest are not catch aid from that person it realli isnt relev martin it depend on the activ of the dinner parti at most respect dinner parti there wouldnt be ani activ where you would catch aid so i dont see whi should have to tell peopl would you tell your guest that one of them had cancer but if you were give an orgi i think you should tell peopl ford i dont know that i would invit somebodi to dinner know they have aid simpli becaus i think it would make everybodi veri uncomfort but i think it all depend on the situat if you are go to do that i think you have to be veri care how you do it and whom you invit barrow yes most peopl will know that they cannot contract the diseas by be seat at a dinner tabl

feed on the street but it is not done proper in the unit state and the argument that it is a natur thing bear no weight with me ford ive alway said that whatev a mother want to do is her busi the onli thing is i think you should do it in privat go to an airport area not popul by peopl go into anoth room in someon hous if a child has sever set of parent becaus of divorc how do you decid who should come to school on parent day baldridg it up to the child to decid whom he or she want the child should ask that parent to come and then apolog to the other and explain whi they werent ask ford it all

that this evid is suffici for list the chemic under section 313 on the other hand where a review of the scientif data indic that the chemic will caus various advers effect at moder dose level epa believ base on the total weight of the evid that there is suffici evid for list the chemic under epcra section 313 epa also conduct an analysi of exposur for each chemic or chemic categori propos for

interpret of the epcra section 313 criteria is given in unit iii of this preambl a discuss of the evid support epa propos to add each of the chemic to epcra section 313 is present in unit iv of this preambl and in the record support this propos rule 4 other consider epa exclud certain chemic and chemic categori from consider for propos list under epcra section 313 in this rulemak for a number of reason some chemic were identifi onli as environment degrad product rather than chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use by a facil these chemic will onli be present in the environ as a result of the releas into the environ of precursor chemic if the degrad product meet the toxic criteria of epcra section 313 the precursor chemic may be consid for list on epcra section 313 the degrad product would not be consid for list on epcra section 313 becaus a facil subject to epcra section 313 is onli requir to file a tri report for a chemic that it manufactur process or otherwis use within the facil boundari therefor epa doe not believ that it is appropri to consid list such chemic at this time some of the list review by epa includ list that repres wast stream from particular process these wast stream such as coke oven emiss are not discret chemic or chemic categori but contain a wide rang of chemic mani of which are current list individu on epcra section 313 the focus of this rulemak is on the addit of specif chemic and chemic categori and as such epa believ that these wast stream are inappropri for list under epcra section 313 at this time epa also exclud chemic whose onli identifi toxic concern was a result of their status as a volatil organ compound voc voc contribut to the format of tropospher ozon which caus a number of health relat and environment problem epa continu to believ that voc meet the list criteria of epcra section 313 howev epa intend to address the issu of how voc should be list on epcra section 313 separ therefor chemic whose onli identifi toxic concern is due to their status as voc were exclud from consider at this time epa also identifi chemic that are routin manufactur process or otherwis use at level far below the report threshold of epcra section 313 these chemic are not expect to ever be manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti at or abov these report threshold in this propos rulemak epa is attempt to add chemic to epcra section 313 that are manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti greater than the epcra section 313 volum threshold and thus would result in the submiss of tri report consequ chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti less than the epcra section 313 volum threshold were exclud from further consider at this time becaus no report would be file under epcra section 313 for such chemic some of the chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use below the epcra section 313 activ threshold particular those chemic that are manufactur in trace amount in wast stream are high toxic at veri low dose level and have physic chemic or biolog properti that make the chemic persist for extend period in the environ and bioaccumul through the food chain persist bioaccumul toxic chemic such as dioxin are of particular concern in ecosystem such as the great lake basin due to the long retent time of the individu lake and the cycl of the chemic from one compon of the ecosystem to anoth epa may reconsid in the futur the issu of list such chemic in a manner which would result in the submiss of tri report epa request comment on the follow is it appropri to list such chemic on epcra section 313 if epa were to add this type of chemic to epcra section 313 what modif to epcra section 313 such as lower the report threshold and modifi the de minimi in mixtur exempt 40 cfr part

this section to remov a chemic from the section 313 c list the administr must determin that there is not suffici evid to establish ani of the criteria describ abov as requir by epcra section 313 d 3 thus the criteria for list or delist a chemic are ident howev wherea epa can add a chemic if onli one of the criteria is met it can onli delet a chemic if none of the criteria are met to ascertain whether there is suffici or insuffici evid to determin that the statutori criteria are met for list a chemic epa conduct a hazard assess on the chemic and determin base on the weight of the evid whether the chemic can reason be anticip to caus ani of the advers effect specifi in epcra section 313 d 2 the hazard analysi is describ abov in unit ii 3 of this preambl epa interpret of the specif statutori criteria follow 1 section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect to determin whether the section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect criterion is met epa must examin the advers effect associ with the chemic the concentr level which would caus acut human health effect and the likelihood of such level exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas such a determin may includ among other factor consider of product process workplac procedur pollut control and the volum and pattern of product use and releas as well as other chemic specif factor epa believ that to make the section 313 d 2 a determin it must demonstr that a chemic can reason be anticip to be releas in quantiti that result in concentr level or within a reason margin of exposur of the concentr level that would be expect to caus acut human health effect beyond the facil site boundari the margin of exposur appli is depend upon the type of hazard data eg data in anim versus human and the confid in this hazard data base for acut effect eg suffici of the hazard data howev epa is not requir to make a facil specif find nor is it necessari for epa to demonstr that these concentr level or effect occur at or near ani particular facil ref 1 furthermor epa may but is not requir to conduct new studi or risk assess or perform site specif analys to establish actual ambient concentr or to document advers effect at ani particular locat ref 1 nor is epa limit to consid concentr level and potenti acut human health effect at the fencelin rather the phrase beyond facil site boundari reflect congress recognit that the highest concentr to which person outsid the site boundari may be expos could occur at ani point outsid the boundari of the site on which the facil is locat includ for exampl where an air emiss plume cool and settl to the ground ref 1 therefor epa believ that to make a find under epcra section 313 d 2 a the agenc may estim concentr at or beyond the facil site boundari through the use of estim releas and model techniqu the term continu or frequent recur releas is includ onli to distinguish routin releas that are a normal consequ of the oper of a facil from the episod and accident releas that are subject to epcra section 304 ref 1 as such epa believ that episod and accident releas are not pertin in a determin that a chemic meet the section 313 d 2 a criterion 2 section 313 d 2 b chronic human health effect in contrast to the section 313 d 2 a criterion section 313 d 2 b doe not requir consider of either the natur and frequenc of releas or concentr level at facil site boundari rather section 313 d 2 b is focus sole on whether the chemic is known or can reason be anticip to caus cancer teratogen or other serious or irrevers chronic human health effect consequ epa believ that it is suffici to consid onli the toxic of the subject chemic to make the section 313 d 2 b determin 3 section 313 d 2 c environment effect the section 313 d 2 c criterion requir epa to consid a chemic potenti to caus signific advers effect on the environ the statut direct epa to base it determin on a consider of the toxic of the chemic either alon or in combin with the persist of the chemic or the potenti for the chemic to bioaccumul congress intend that epa consid a broad rang of environment effect when make a determin under section 313 d 2 c in determin what constitut a signific advers effect on the environ the administr should consid the extent to which the toxic chemic caus or can reason be anticip to caus ani of the follow advers reaction even if restrict to the immedi vicin adjac to the site 1 gradual or sudden chang in the composit of anim life or plant life includ fungal or microbi organ in an area 2 abnorm number of death of organ eg fish kill 3 reduct of the reproduct success or the vigor of a speci 4 reduct in agricultur product whether crop or livestock 5 alter in the behavior or distribut of a speci 6 long last or irrevers contamin of compon of the physic environ especi in the case of groundwat and surfac water and soil resourc that have limit self cleans capabl ref 1 epa believ that the environment effect criterion inher contain a limit exposur compon becaus of the statutori requir for epa to find a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgment of the administr to warrant report under epcra section 313 unlik section 313 d 2 b where epa onli has to determin whether certain kind of effect are known or reason anticip to occur section 313 d 2 c requir epa to find the effect to be of suffici serious to warrant report which impli the possibl that under certain circumst a chemic that could theoret caus a signific advers effect on the environ is unlik to caus one of a magnitud to warrant list the extent to which exposur is factor into epa determin depend upon the inher toxic of a chemic and a varieti of other chemic specif characterist epa believ that when a chemic is inher extrem toxic that is it is toxic at veri low dose level an exposur assess is not necessari becaus even minim releas of such a chemic may reason be anticip to result in signific advers environment effect in such case epa could reli on toxic alon under section 313 d 2 c i as a basi for list howev for chemic that exhibit advers effect upon the environ sole base on toxic at moder low dose epa believ that consider of potenti exposur is warrant becaus minim releas may not result in signific advers effect upon the environ these exposur consider may includ among other factor pollut control the volum and pattern of product use and releas environment fate as well as other chemic specif factor and the use of estim releas and model techniqu epcra section 313 d 2 c ii and iii allow epa to consid the impact of other characterist of a chemic where a chemic exhibit signific advers effect in the environ base on toxic and persist or toxic and bioaccumul at veri low to moder low dose level epa believ that exposur consider are not requir in addit to those consider implicit in evalu of the chemic potenti for persist and bioaccumul this is becaus even minim releas of the chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ or in an organ that can reason be anticip to result in signific advers effect this reflect the increas likelihood that there will be exposur to a chemic that persist due to it longer resid time in the environ repeat minim releas of a persist chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ for a chemic that bioaccumul even low level of the chemic in the environ may result in increas concentr in an organ therefor evalu of a chemic persist or bioaccumul potenti may be consid the function equival of an exposur analysi in addit for chemic which induc well establish advers effect eg chlorofluorocarbon which caus stratospher ozon deplet epa believ that an exposur assess is unnecessari epa believ that these chemic typic do not affect sole one or two speci but rather affect chang across a whole ecosystem epa believ that these effect are of suffici serious that addit exposur consider are not warrant becaus of the scope of their impact and the well document evid support the advers effect epa request comment on it approach for consid exposur as a part of it evalu for list of these chemic under section 313 d 2 c in unit iv b of this preambl epa identifi each of the chemic propos for addit to epcra section 313 and the specif statutori criteria upon which the propos addit is base iv epa technic review a introduct data on the chemic and chemic categori were review for evid indic advers acut and chronic toxic carcinogen mutagen development and reproduct effect neurotox and environment effect inform on the environment fate was also review for each chemic propos for addit to epcra section 313 in this rulemak epa conduct an extens hazard assess and where appropri an analysi of exposur to determin whether the chemic met one or more of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria this hazard assess is discuss in detail in unit ii 3 of this preambl onli after this care review was a final determin made as to whether one of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria was met for each individu chemic or chemic categori propos for list below epa need onli show that one of the list criteria is met in order to list a chemic or chemic categori under epcra section 313 the inform summar below for each chemic or chemic categori repres the key data element that lead epa to believ that there is suffici evid to establish that one of the section 313 d 2 list

naval vessel base on manufactur transfer in septemberand octob 1960 the expand meet of the central militari commiss specif put forth a naval develop polici base on submarin and fast attack craft in 1962 nie rongzheng point out in a brief by the seventh academi that the r d mission of the academi for the next 5 year should be concentr main on the develop of torpedo boat torpedo submarin and torpedo in septemb 1963 luo ruiq state in his report to the central committe regard some issu in the shipbuild industri that in the next few year china should first work on torpedo boat submarin and torpedo then on guid missil submarin missil boat and ship to ship guid missil base on that the defens scienc commiss and the defens industri commiss organ an effort to develop torpedo boat submarin and torpedo and to copi the manufactur of foreign boat in china an effort was also made to design medium and small size surfac vessel after a few year of work china succeed in develop it own torpedo boat in 1965 these boat were urgent need for coastal oper at the time and they were develop use chines materi and domest facil medium size diesel power torpedo submarin were also transfer and produc in the same year and put into servic in 1966 china produc it first gas torpedo while concentr on the develop of torpedo boat submarin and torpedo china also work on guid missil submarin missil boat and ship to ship guid missil effort were made to copi the manufactur process and to use domest materi and equip the problem of weld special steel and the problem of cavit eros of the propel were solv the assembl and product of small missil boat larg missil boat and larg guid missil submarin were success develop work also began on the improv and modif of submarin base on instruct from nie rongzheng to priorit the copi of naval defens missil the defens scienc commiss devot it resourc to copi the shangyou 1 ship to ship missil in 1964 in this period china also develop anti submarin escort vessel and gunboat escort began the prepar for develop a nuclear power submarin and guid missil destroy and initi studi of medium size torpedo submarin 4 militari electron equip extric basic from copi product phase china radio electron technolog had a veri weak base and could not satisfi the need for develop border technolog and convent weapon for this reason consider attent was given by the central committe and the central militari commiss to the develop of defens electron in august 1958 after the expand meet of the politburo met and discuss the second 5 year plan nie rongzheng wrote a letter to the central committe leadership and recommend that attent be given to the studi and product of radio electron in futur plan for capit construct and facil in novemb 1959 the central militari commiss state in a report to the central committe on the develop plan for the last 3 year of the second 5 year plan that radio electron is the weakest link in china defens industri the origin alloc for 1960 1962 must be increas in 1960 the central militari commiss again set a specif polici for develop electron technolog with the attent of the central committe and the central militari commiss and the gradual establish of research institut china defens electron develop quick it basic outgrew the copi phase and began to stand on it own by the mid 1960s china defens electron not onli satisfi the need for develop the two bomb and other urgent need convent weapon but also made some breakthrough in radar communic and electron comput to ensur that china first atom bomb explod in 1964 r d depart finish the develop of control and test equip in time and provid various radiat detect instrument in 1965 china success copi the construct of a surfac to air guid missil station in order to improv the anti jam abil of air defens radar and the detect of hostil aircraft in mountain jungl rain and in cloud china develop it own low altitud warn radar and height finder radar in 1963 in 1964 china improv the perform of it gunsight radar and airborn fire radar in term of counter surveil and counter jam abil these improv were veri import for air combat the continu develop of semiconductor led to the miniatur of defens electron and promot the transit from first generat to second generat electron in order to improv the mobil of troop field communic equip use extens by militari unit up to the divis level were miniatur some semiconductor tactic radio station were also develop in the area of larg short wave communic equip singl sideband technolog was master and sever singl sideband short wave station were built consider result were also obtain in multichannel communic wire radio microwav relay and tropospher scatter generat came on the scene these instrument improv defens communic capabl by 1965 china had develop some semiconductor comput and thus enter the second generat of defens electron chapter iii section 2 breakthrough in the most advanc defens technolog 3 success develop of the nuclear power torpedo submarin the develop of the guid missil nuclear submarin was approv by the central committe in june 1958 a 3 year effort produc some initi result in the hull design and in the nuclear power plant in march 1963 the central special committe decid to put the project on hold becaus of temporari difficulti in the nation economi and a lack of research resourc howev a portion of the research effort was retain to work on technolog breakthrough in the mid 1960s the nation economi improv and the central special committe decid in march 1965 to reinstat the project as a nation project and to launch a full scale r d effort it also ask the second ministri of machin build to complet a land base reactor by 1970 as an intermedi step toward a nuclear power submarin the approach was to verifi the nuclear reactor first on land and then to instal it on the submarin in order to shorten the develop time for the complic technolog of guid missil nuclear submarin the central special committe decid in august of the same year that there would be two phase in the develop the first step was to develop a nuclear torpedo submarin and to solv major technolog problem of a nuclear power submarin and an anti submarin torpedo the second step would be to develop a guid missil nuclear submarin and to solv the key technolog for a submarin to land guid missil and it launch system the central special committe further decid that the first nuclear torpedo submarin should have it maiden voyag in 1972 the submarin should meet all the major tactic requir so that it could be deliv to the navi as a warship the central special committe demand a cooper and coordin effort from the particip depart and committe of the state council so that the nuclear submarin could be develop expedi in 1967 the defens scienc commiss organ and evalu the hull design for the nuclear torpedo submarin base on tactic andtechn requir approv by the central militari commiss the nuclear submarin technolog was complex and requir broad cooper in order to satisfi the equip need of this major engin project so that the develop could proceed in a time fashion the central special committe requir the various depart to treat the develop of instrument and equip of the nuclear submarin as a nation prioriti all busi was conduct accord to the document issu by the central special committe for the develop of the atom bomb regul for the develop of atom energi devic and instrument in may of that year the central special committe further specifi that equip urgent need in the develop of the nuclear submarin should be provid in a time manner by the state plan commiss the ministri of materi and other relev depart these depart respond to all the need and often made special effort beyond their regular oper to solv the coordin problem togeth with the offic of defens industri the defens scienc commiss also held a number of larg coordin meet in the summer of 1967 liu huaq 0491 5478 3237 chair a larg coordin meet attend by sever hundr offic and technic cadr of plant and research institut nie rongzheng spoke and ask the cadr to work hard for the develop of the nuclear torpedo submarin for the great caus of nation defens later the state plan commiss and the offic of defens industri also organ a develop effort for equip system and new materi they organ more than 1 600 plant give the submarin develop effort strong support in order to strengthen the coordin and organ the central militari commiss approv the establish of the nuclear submarin engin offic under the defens scienc commiss in februari 1968 in octob 1969 the state council and the central militari commiss also decid to form a nuclear submarin engin leadership group under their supervis offic were establish under the group to take care of day to day busi various industri ministri research institut provinc municip and militari region also form their own offic or group for nuclear submarin engin a top down chain of command was therefor establish organiz the state council and the central militari commiss nuclear submarin engin leadership group led the various research depart manufactur plant and univers in conduct the develop project problem that aros in the test were address by time inspect and coordin the qualiti and progress of the nuclear submarin develop were solid guarante base on the need for ocean test and requir of the associ weapon system the central special committe approv the establish of three test field for torpedo underwat sound and submarin to land guid missil the state council and the central militari commiss decid to includ the build of a dual plane self guid anti submarin torpedo as part of the nuclear submarin engin project and gave it a high prioriti with the hard work of all the particip the torpedo plant and the three test site were built and began to assum product and test mission construct of the nuclear submarin assembl plant and the land base nuclear reactor was vital to the develop schedul mao zedong sign two telegram in 1968 and 1969 respect order the shenyang militari region to support the construct of the nuclear submarin general assembl plant and the chengdu

nuclear submarin was anoth major achiev of china strateg weapon develop program it show that china first generat nuclear submarin was design and built proper and led the way to the second generat nuclear submarin chapter vi develop of nuclear weapon nuclear weapon make use of the energi releas from self sustain nuclear fission or fusion reaction for mass kill and destruct in 1955 china decid to initi it nuclear industri and to develop it nuclear weapon after 30 year china has independ master the technolog of atom and hydrogen bomb and has made major advanc in the develop of new nuclear weapon section 1 prepar for the develop of nuclear weapon l establish of nuclear scientif research center the develop of nuclear weapon reli on the establish of nuclear scienc and technolog and a nuclear industri befor the format of the peopl republ of china although there was the atom research institut in beij and the nuclear physic laboratori under the institut of physic in academia sinica the total number of research was less than 10 and there was not even a small acceler nuclear scienc and technolog was basic a void in china at that time the new china stress the initi and develop of nuclear scienc and technolog in april 1950 the chines academi of scienc cas establish the institut of modern physic it main mission was to establish a foundat for nuclear scienc and technolog and prepar for nuclear energi applic and develop the director of the institut was wu youxun 0702 2589 6064 and the deputi director was qian sanqiang the institut of modern physic had some renown scientist but there were too few of them and their specialti did not complement each other the press oblig at the time was to attract talent and to expand the rank of scienc research with zhou enlai interest and support the institut attract theoret physicist peng huanwu from qinghua univers and experiment physicist wang ganchang 3769 3227 2490 from zhejiang univers in 1955 13 scientist and oversea chines student came to the institut from europ and the unit state some of them risk their live to do so the famous nuclear physicist zhao zhongyao 6392 1813 1031 was illeg detain by american troop in japan as he was return to china from the unit state via japan it was onli with the protest from the chines scientif communiti and civil organ and the support of friend in the scientif communiti in america and other countri that zhao was freed by the american troop in this period china also draft a group of young technician and capabl colleg graduat to move the nuclear research forward in spring 1949 newli liber beij did not have the necessari equip for nuclear research minist li weihan 2621 4850 3352 of the unit front work depart under the communist central committe approv a special foreign exchang fund the money was transfer by qian xuesen indirect to two oversea chines student in franc and england with the help of the curi laboratori in franc and some british friend they manag to buy a batch of equip and literatur and brought them back to china despit the embargo this equip and data togeth with the 30 box of equip brought by zhao zhongyao from the unit state becam the main resourc of the institut of modern physic in the earli day leader of the institut led the staff in learn from the yanan spirit and made the most out of old and discard equip some of the electron compon were bought in salvag yard and mani instrument were built by the research themselv gradual the research facil was improv and some result were obtain with zhao zhongyao in charg the institut built a 700 kv atmospher electrostat acceler and a high voltag 25 mev electrostat acceler with he zehui 0149 3419 1979 in charg the institut built a number of nuclear detector and instrument with wang ganchang as the design the institut also built a 30 x 30 x 10 cm sup 3 7000 gauss cloud chamber on luoxueshan in yunnan they built china first mountain cosmic ray laboratori at an elev of 3 180 meter and began research on strang particl peng huanwu and other initi research on nuclear physic elementari particl physic and reactor theori research in the radiat chemistri group began the extract purif and analysi of uranium and the develop of heavi water and high puriti graphit by 1955 the institut of modern physic had ongo research in six area and had train a group of key research some research result were obtain and the foundat of china nuclear scienc and technolog was establish in the mid 1950s when the central committe of the chines communist parti promot the develop of atom energi r d in nuclear sciencemad new advanc notabl a 7000 kw experiment heavi water reactor and a 12 meter diamet cyclotron were built in tuoli beij and put into oper in septemb 1958 the construct of the reactor and cyclotron was organ by liu wei 0149 0251 administr of the architectur and construct bureau under the state construct commiss and guid by soviet expert and built by beij municip the third ministri of machin build and the architectur and engin depart in close cooper after that the atom energi institut former the institut of modern physic was led by the cas and the second ministri of machin build most under the latter while complet the reactor and the cyclotron the atom energi institut also import laboratori facil from the soviet union for uranium isotop separ by gas diffus instrument develop independ includ high voltag multipli crystal spectromet neutron spectromet neutron selector nanosecond oscilloscop and a zero power reactor a total of 50 instrument were built and research began in nuclear physic reactor physic plutonium chemistri and isotop separ in earli 1960 the institut had a total of 4 300 peopl with 1 500 of them be technic staff have a colleg educ work began in 20 disciplin and 60 branch gradual a comprehens nuclear scienc r d center was form it prepar personnel and technolog for china independ develop of a nuclear industri and nuclear weapon 2 build up a nuclear industri while establish nuclear scienc and technolog china also began a survey of uranium resourc under the leadership of deputi minist liu jie 0149 2638 of the ministri of geolog prepar for the mine of uranium began in februari 1954 from june to octob 1954 geologist gao zhizhang 7559 0037 2627 and other survey haicheng in liaon and fuzhong and shanmuchong in guangxi where uranium was discov befor the new china they brought back uranium ore sampl from shanmuchong these find receiv the attent of mao zedong and zhou enlai who were quick brief by liu jie mao said we are veri hope there are bound to be uranium mine we onli have to look for them after accomplish some preliminari achiev in nuclear technolog and make some discoveri in uranium mine the chines communist parti held an expand meet of it central secretariat on 15 januari 1955 in this meet chair by mao zedong a polici was formul to develop china atom energi that decis mark the begin of china nuclear industri and nuclear weapon develop on 20 januari an agreement was sign by china and the soviet union to conduct a joint survey of uranium deposit in china in april the state council decid to establish a third bureau of the ministri of geolog under the third offic of the state council lei rongtian 7191 2837 1131 was name bureau chief in charg of all geolog effort relat to uranium mine in china also uranium geolog survey team such as the hunan 309 team and the xinjiang 519 team were form with peopl draft from relev depart region and arm servic in china the draft order came from the parti central committe the state council and the central militari commiss under the organ of the third bureau of the ministri of geolog and the advic of the soviet expert the geolog survey team found a larg number of radiat anomali includ 11 site worthi of further investig the survey effort and industri evalu continu and the first uranium reserv data were report to the state by 1960 there were eight mine site for uranium and the first set of uranium mine requir was satisfi as china was plan it first batch of uranium mine process plant and nuclear fuel plant it was face with a question how largeshould the nuclear industri be in earli 1957 zhou enlai point out that china should have it own nuclear industri system and it own nuclear forc howev the problem was to go from have not to have so the scale should not be too larg base on this the third ministri of machin build re evalu the plan in the china soviet agreement and felt that the scale of the plan was too big after repeat studi and to satisfi the requir of maintain a complet set of nuclear industri they propos a smaller but complet plan the size of the uranium concentr plant was great reduc and invest was reduc by 40 percent the new propos suit the chines situat better and was approv by the parti central committe and the state council anoth import issu in china nuclear industri develop was how to implement the polici of main self reliant but strive for extern assist in the 1959 movement of technolog innov and revolut some peopl want to improv the technolog by revis the soviet plant design and the design of instrument and meter minist song renqiong 1345 01717 4522 report this situat to mao zedong in a letter mao comment was let us learn how to walk befor we learn how to run base on this the second ministri of machin build urg all the technic worker to patient learn from the soviet expert and to understand the soviet technolog it was emphas that no revis were permit befor master the soviet technolog and equip and instrument suppli by the soviet union were not to be modifi or dismantl in case where the soviet technolog did not suit the chines situat necessari improv were made onli after experiment research and with the approv of the soviet expert the state council also decid that when equip and raw materi could be found in china they should be suppli domest an effort was made to produc special equip in china thus creat the abil to design and manufactur the need equip the construct of the atom energi institut was acceler and special research organ for uranium mine geolog and uranium ore refin were establish the initi of the research personnel was fulli mobil and self relianc was enhanc in the nationwid great leap forward movement there were instanc of push safeti and qualiti asid in the pursuit of product and construct schedul for such behavior the second ministri of machin build took a firm stand and clear side with qualiti and safeti construct not meet qualiti standard had to be bulldoz and rebuilt deputi minist in charg of capit construct liu wei inde led the destruct of substandard build and start construct all over again this rigor attitud got the attent of the construct unit and ensur the qualiti of construct in the build up of the nuclear industri china proper handl the issu of self relianc outsid assist construct scope and nation resourc the correct polici and practic led to veri good result in august 1960 uranium mine in chenxian counti and hengshan dapu in hunan and shengyao in jiangxi were near complet the uranium process plant in hengyang hunan began instal equip the lanzhou uranium enrich plant was partial equip and the associ civil construct for the atom enterpris in qiuchuan gansu and the fuel element plant in baotou inner mongolia were also near complet the success build up of the nuclear industri made the develop of nuclear weapon possibl section 2 develop of the first atom bomb to speed up the pace of nuclear weapon develop china activ sought help from the soviet union the agreement on new defensetechnolog sign by china and the soviet union contain an articl state that the soviet union would help china develop it nuclear weapon the implement of this agreement was relat smooth in the begin and contribut to the construct of nuclear weapon develop base in northwest china howev as the split between the two parti and the two countri deepen the govern of the soviet union not onli ceas to provid teach model and graphic data for the atom bomb but also unilater void the agreement in august 1960 the soviet union withdrew all 233 expert assist china develop of the nuclear industri and carri away import graph and data the suppli of equip and materi stop short thereaft the unilater action by the soviet union to tear up the agreement caus sever difficulti and great loss in china nuclear industri and nuclear weapon develop at this key moment the parti central committe decid to develop the atom bomb with china own resourc this import polici stimul the patriot fervor and nation pride of the develop personnel they were determin to develop the atom bomb with their own intellig and skill they were determin to break the hegemoni nuclear monopoli and bring glori to china and it peopl 1 tackl key problem in atom bomb develop at the end of the 1950s china nuclear base in the northwest were still under construct and not readi to begin r d work the second ministri of machin build decid to begin the research and design of the atom bomb in the nuclear weapon institut establish in beij in juli 1958 effort were put in three area the first area was the assembl of talent at the end of 1959 nuclear physicist zhu guangya 2612 0342 0068 left the atom energi institut and becam the deputi director of the nuclear weapon institut where he assist li jue 2621 6030 and wu jilin 0702 7139 7207 in organ and coordin the effort in march 1960 with the approv of deng xiaop 105 senior and middl level technic staff includ guo yonghuai 6753 3057

yonghuai took the assign of deputi director of the nuclear weapon institut togeth with deng jiaxian 6772 4471 0341 who came over from the atom energi institut earlier they form the backbon of the nuclear weapon develop effort the second area was the establish of research laboratori and shop for theoret physic explos physic neutron physic radiat chemistri metal physic deton control and ballist trajectori the third area was the build of more laboratori and the acquisit of more equip from other depart and from abroad after 6 month of prepar the develop of an atom bomb formal began in spring 1960 the atom bomb was a new topic for china and initi explor was conduct in theoret design explos physic neutron physic radiat chemistri deton control system and structur design a theoret design theoret design of china first atom bomb was conduct under the supervis of peng huanwu deng jiaxian and zhou guangzhao peng analyz the entir process of atom bomb explos and determin the princip physic quantiti for the differ stage his analysi was veri import for understand the basic principl and the physic pictur of the nuclear reaction research proceed befor the nuclear reaction after the chines new year in 1960 hu side 5170 1835 1795 and three other young workersstudi the equat of state of the explos product particular the uranium equat of state they were determin to succeed and began with learn basic knowledg they survey foreign literatur and learn as they proceed after half a year they final establish the equat of state for the entir pressur rang these result form the basi for calcul the overal mechan of the atom bomb in april 1960 sun qingh 1327 3237 3109 zhu jianshi 2612 1696 1102 and eight other young worker perform the whole bodi mechan calcul of the atom bomb use onli a few manual crank and electr calcul becaus of the larg volum of calcul they work around the clock in three shift everybodi work more than 10 hour a day within a year time they had repeat the calcul for the materi movement within the bomb bodi a total of nine time with result veri close to each other in may 1961 zhou guangzhao was transfer to assum the duti of first deputi director of the theoret design offic of the nuclear weapon institut he care analyz the calcul result and prove their correct from a theoret approach meanwhil mathematician zhou yulin 0719 3022 7792 also obtain the same result use effect comput procedur after this work scientist gain a deeper understand of the mechan process befor the nuclear reaction this understand later becam the solid foundat for theoret design and mechan calcul of the atom bomb research was done to studi the process after the nuclear reaction peng huanwu describ the energi releas in the chain reaction and other physic phenomena when the nuclear materi was compress to a super high critic state mathematician qin yuanxun 4440 0337 8113 and li deyuan 2621 1795 0337 complet the total calcul for the energi releas process after the nuclear materi was compress to a super high critic state after 2 year of extens calcul and repeat discuss the theoret design had a better understand of the reaction process and perform of an atom bomb load with enrich uranium the first theoret design propos was submit in march 1963 b explos physic research this work was conduct under the supervis of wang ganchang and chen nengkuan the goal of the experi was not onli to verifi the theoret design of the atom bomb and to evalu the dynam behavior of the compon but also to solv some key technic problem in the develop of the atom bomb with the approv of the central militari commiss and befor the complet of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base it was decid that small scale explos test would be conduct at the test ground of the armi engin corp in beij test were conduct to studi the deton element and the equat of state of the materi the object was also to investig the basic principl of atom bomb design and measur method for differ paramet and to train technic personnel with actual oper abil in earli april the construct of the explos test site was go at full steam in order to save time wu yungwen led staff and worker to melt explos in ordinari kitchen aluminum pot in temporari shed cylind were form with cardboard instead of metal mold manual stir replac mechan stir and the first explos compon was cast later they develop a new explos inject method that improv the qualiti and perform of the charg the develop of the high pressur deton was a cooper effort by deputi director qian jin of the second laboratori in the nuclear weapon institut the beij industri univers the xian third academi of the third ministri of machin build and the no 804 plant after thousand of test a high perform high pressur deton was develop extens test prove that perform met requir in order to acquir the focus waveform chen nengkuan and cowork spent about a year in design and test the first deton element lin chuanliu 2651 0278 7511 and cowork spent 2 year develop electr measur instrument and other test instrument wu shifa 0702 0013 3127 appli high speed photographi to deton experi and solv the measur problem in the test c neutron physic and radiat chemistri this project was led by qian sanqiang and guid by he zehui the neutron sourc was an import compon of the atom bomb and it develop was assum by the atom energi institut and the nuclear weapon institut the develop follow a three prong approach the young technic staff in wang fangd 3769 2455 1353 group conduct hundr of test and develop a neutron sourc at the end of 1962 that met the nuclear weapon requir technician and worker at the atom energi institut conquer a seri of technolog hurdl and solv the packag problem of the neutron sourc and the final inspect techniqu the neutron sourc develop by wang fangd et al function success in the deton test of decemb 1963 it was employ in the first nuclear test the neutron sourc develop by the two other approach were also success in the area of neutron physic scientist at the atom energi institut and other unit measur the heavi ion neutron cross section in the fission reaction the energi spectrum of the fission neutron and the averag number of fission neutron they establish method and standard for radiat measur the atom energi institut had also assist the nuclear weapon institut in complet the theoret calcul for the fast neutron critic devic and the critic safeti calcul d deton control the synchron deton devic in the deton control system was a key compon for achiev implos of the nuclear devic hui zhongxi 1920 6988 6932 zhu guoliang 4376 0948 2733 and other took on the job with a crude facil and after sever month of hard work solv the circuit design problem and master the design technolog for the synchron deton devic meanwhil other compon of the deton control system were also complet in time these result were all employ in the first nuclear test e structur design led by guo yonghuai and long wenguang design of the atom bomb studi two propos of the nuclear devic from the deton and mechan point of view by 1962 they had obtain the expect result 2 crash construct of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base from march to june 1958 the joint site select group consist of chines and soviet expert select jinyintan in haiyan counti qinghai provinc as the place to construct the northwest nuclear weapon base the choic was approv by the parti central committe in juli later the soviet union provid some preliminari design and a small amount of equip for part of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base meanwhil all region and depart in china strong support theconstruct of the base the peopl govern of qinghai form a special group to assist the land use reloc road local construct materi and live suppli problem it also select 7 000 abl bodi men to particip in the base construct the construct engin depart select peopl from it lanzhou engin bureau and the ninth product facil instal compani to form the no 104 construct engin compani and the fourth engin offic in the no 103 instal engin compani to assum the construct duti the central militari commiss also assign 1 900 veteran to the base to enhanc the capit construct forc this capit construct team move onto the construct site begin in februari 1959 in order to save time design and construct proceed in parallel in august 1960 construct start on the deton experi site later work began on the assembl and explos process plant mechan process plant and standbi electr power plant construct proceed at a brisk pace howev around 1961 china nation economi encount some sever difficulti the situat in qinghai harsh even in normal time becam even wors the month grain quota per person was reduc by more than 10 jin each person could onli have two qian of oil and hard ani veget malnutrit caus edema in more than 40 percent of the personnel in some unit construct was great affect face with this dire situat base leader includ li jui 2621 6030 strove to keep both the project and the worker welfar afloat team were organ to work on agricultur anim husbandri and fisheri plant fish and hunt were activ for solv the shortag of stapl and supplement foodstuff zhou enlai was veri concern about the worker at the base and decid to bring in food from the east and west in order to deal with the emerg at the worst moment the ministri of food alloc sever million jin of soybean to three unit of the second ministri of machin build in the northwest includ the nuclear weapon develop base the qinghai peopl govern also ship 40 000 sheep to the base the ministri of commerc set up special second level wholesal station in lanzhou gansu these step stimul the confid and courag of the worker stabil the rank and ensur the normal progress of the project at the end of 1962 the explos pour plant and two small test site were complet and the base began to look like a develop base howev the deton test site and main build like the assembl plant were yet to be built in the meantim larg scale deton test and atom bomb assembl had to be move from beij to the base these project requir anoth 100 000 squar meter of capit construct the complex and qualiti requir of the construct togeth with the short frost free period on the qinghai plateau and under strength work forc made the base construct exceed difficult in earli decemb 1962 the central special committe review and approv the 2 year plan for atom bomb develop propos by the second ministri of machin build the committe also investig the construct progress of the northwest nuclear weapon base and decid to take some action to speed up the pace of construct on 7 decemb deputi director zheng hantao 6774 3352 3447 of the central special committe offic met with 13 depart includ the ministri of construct transport water conserv and electr power telecommun and the armi corp of engin railway and communic it was decid that a 15 000 man construct team with 500 piec of construct equip and 300 motor vehicl should be sent to the construct site for a crash build effort under the joint command head by li jue the major construct task werecomplet in april 1964 which made the breakthrough in atom bomb technolog possibl with the complet of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base the develop of the atom bomb was gradual shift from beij to the northwest prior to 1969 the ninth bureau of the second ministri of machin build the beij nuclear weapon institut and the northwest nuclear weapon develop base were three name of the same institut the research design and product of nuclear weapon were done by the same organ in 1969 the new base was complet and was given the job of nuclear weapon research and design it was call the nuclear weapon design institut the northwest nuclear weapon develop base was then respons onli for the product of nuclear weapon the research design and product of the nuclear weapon have sinc been separ 3 product of enrich uranium and develop of nuclear compon a product of enrich uranium china first atom bomb was load with enrich uranium the time product of accept uranium was therefor key to the success develop of the atom bomb plan of the lanzhou enrich uranium plant began in 1956 and construct began in 1958 under the organ of plant director wang jiefu 3769 0094 4395 and with help from the no 101 construct compani the second engin offic of the no 103 instal compani and the atom energi institut the princip civil engin was basic complet in 1960 in 1961 the diffus unit were in place and fluorid howev product and stabl oper of the plant still requir uranium hexafluorid materi and separ membran to solv the product and suppli problem of uranium hexafluorid zhou enlai wrote a letter to khrushchev in may 1960 zhou ask the soviet union to honor the agreement and provid the lanzhou enrich uranium plant with the necessari uranium hexafluorid becaus the soviet union refus to suppli the materi the second ministri of machin build decid in juli 1960 to produc the materi by the tube method deng zuoq 6772 0146 0615 and zheng qiongi 6774 8825 5391 of the beij uranium refin institut organ an effort to complet the tube product facil in 4 month the facil produc

crude shop scientist launch into all out experiment research of the atom bomb under the guidanc of wang ganchang and chen nengkuan a seri of plan local decomposit deton test were conduct from may to novemb 1963 on 24 decemb a scale down integr deton test was perform howev there were differ interpret of the test result after tang xiaowei 0781 1321 1218 made an overal analysi of the test paramet a correct judgement was made which was later verifi by further test this integr test verifi the theoret design and the result of separ test it laid the foundat for the design of the atom bomb the success of the integr deton experi and the acquisit of the high enrich uranium were import achiev in china develop of it first atom bomb it indic that major technic hurdl have been overcom after receiv the report zhou enlai happili congratul the worker for complet vital product and technic test ahead of schedul he also encourag them to be prudent and persist in carri out the remain task in order to be absolut sure scientist conduct a full scale deton simul test and other relat test in june 1964 the test were a total success in 4 year there was a total of 1 000 small scale test and sever larg scale test to evalu the compon separ and in combin the theoret design was verifi and key technic problem in integr deton were solv the result were veri fruit larg scale deton test show that both structur compon were satisfactori to ensur time product of the necessari compon for the first nuclear explos leu jie held extens discuss with the expert and technic staff he decid on 23 march 1964 that a structur compon design by wu daixian 0124 0108 0341 with greater rigid and strength would be use howev the new compon was more difficult to machin to high precis the requir machin precis was not avail at that time at either the northwest base or in the second ministri of machin build with the permiss of the central special committe a precis machin shop was set up in the 403 plant of the third ministri of machin build and the task was complet as an emerg measur the task was coordin by minist sun zhiyuan of the third ministri deputi secretari liu boluo 0149 2672 5012 of the offic of

qualiti of the part was assur in juli and august technic staff and worker at the northwest nuclear weapon base complet the assembl of three accept nuclear devic this was accomplish with strong support from various depart and the oper was perform strict accord to the procedur the work was led by cai baozhen 5591 2128 4176 in mid and late august the devic were ship via special train to the nuclear test base in the northwest follow the instruct from zhou enlai the movementwa kept under strict secreci and secur befor the train start detail transport procedur were formul specif requir were set for the stop along the way and for transfer team and secur procedur the train was escort by arm polic and the rout was guard by public secur polic at the border of two provinc the train was escort across the border by the public secur chief of the two provinc and the secur duti was transfer from one to the other all the steel hammer for rail inspect were replac with brass hammer to avoid spark all the coal use by the train was sift to detect the presenc of explos high voltag power was temporarili cut off in region where the train was pass under tight secur and plan the nuclear devic were safe deliv to the intend station in xinjiang the devic were then transport by truck to the northwest nuclear test site enrich uranium compon were flown direct to the test site on 16 octob 1964 china first atom bomb was success deton at the northwest nuclear test site after the explos the atom energi institut conduct radiat chemistri analysi and the nuclear weapon institut and the northwest nuclear technolog institut conduct optic and mechan measur to determin the power of the explos the power was equival to 20 000 ton of tnt close to the theoret valu the test result show that the research design experiment fabric and test of china first atom bomb had met the design requir and a solid foundat was establish for the develop of nuclear weapon section 3 breakthrough in hydrogen bomb technolog as a nuclear weapon the hydrogen bomb make use of the enorm amount of energi releas at the instanc of the fusion reaction thermonuclear reaction of deuterium and tritium isotop of hydrogen the power of a hydrogen bomb is much greater than that of an atom bomb there is a qualit jump from the atom bomb to the hydrogen bomb all countri engag in nuclear weapon develop have strive to develop the hydrogen bomb as quick as possibl after they succeed in develop the atom bomb china also began it explor of the hydrogen bomb and obtain some result while it was develop the atom bomb in februari 1965 the central special committe approv the report on the acceler develop of nuclear weapon submit by the second ministri of machin build and decid to conduct a nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb devic in 1968 this goal stimul all the worker in nuclear scienc and technolog to reach a new high 1 explor the theori of h bomb design the success stori in china develop of the atom bomb was the attent to design research and the basic principl it was also an import approach to the h bomb technolog breakthrough the second ministri and the nuclear weapon institut took some effect action in basic research a in decemb 1960 base on the plan made by liu jie qian sanqiong and organ by huang zuchia 7806 4371 3174 and yu min 0060 2404 of the atom energi institut and form the lepton nuclear theori group the group began to explor h bomb principl and the differ physic process and viabl structur in 4 year the group has submit 69 research result report and gain in depth understand of mani basic phenomena in septemb 1963 some of the scientist of the nuclear weapon institut began the theoret explor of the h bomb by design an atom bomb that contain thermonuclear materi after the success of the first nuclear test the institut quick shift most of the theoret research to h bomb research in order tostrengthen the theoret effort on the h bomb the second ministri of machin build decid to move huang zuqia yu min and anoth 29 peopl from the atom energi institut to the nuclear weapon institut in januari 1965 after these chang the theoret group becam a strong forc in h bomb research b formul design principl in februari 1965 under the supervis of zhu guangya and peng huanwu deng jiaxian and zhou guangzhao led the scientist in consolid the experi of the previous stage of research and formul a work plan to achiev the h bomb technolog breakthrough the second step was to complet the theoret design of the thermonuclear warhead to meet requir in weight power and the deploy of nuclear weapon c prepar accur and complet nuclear data accur and complet nuclear data are import to the design of nuclear devic scientist at the nuclear weapon institut discov mani inconsist in nuclear data in the literatur in februari 1965 he zehui of the atom energi institut led 30 research staff to conduct nuclear reaction cross section measur for thermonuclear materi they use the research result obtain by ding dazhao and other and obtain reliabl experiment data after half a year of experiment research d conduct exploratori h bomb test to understand thermonuclear reaction and to obtain first hand inform as need in the h bomb design the central special committe approv the test of an enhanc atom bomb the design of the enhanc atom bomb was base on the first experiment atom bomb but contain a certain amount of thermonuclear materi the structur was modifi correspond theoret design proceed quick and use onli about half a year sinc the new test use compon of the deton system that was employ in the two previous atom bomb test the fabric process also progress quick from septemb 1965 to april 1966 deton subcrit and environment test were complet on 9 may 1966 an atmospher test of the enhanc atom bomb was success conduct this test provid real data for the theoret studi of the h bomb e break through the h bomb design after a year of investig scientist clear recogn that in order to break through the h bomb design principl they must pursu mani approach and understand the princip factor that affect the burn of the thermonuclear materi and the rule of energi releas from februari to juli 1965 the theoret depart of the nuclear weapon institut concentr on sever structur propos and conduct repeat calcul the result were not satisfactori face an impass scientist consolid experi and conduct various special topic symposia and discuss so that everyon could think about the problem and come up with new concept new idea and new propos the main direct for pursu the h bomb theori was determin this way in the summer of 1965 scientist at the nuclear weapon institut learn from foreign news media that franc plan to conduct a test of their first thermonuclear devic in 1968 to win one for china and the chines peopl they propos to realiz china first h bomb befor the french deputi director yu min of the theoret depart of the institut led staff member to the huadong comput institut in shanghai befor nation day and spent all the holiday calcul model after analysi they obtain import result in the burn rule of thermonuclear materi howev the model was too heavi and the specif power and specif fusion were low and did not meet the criterion of 1 million ton of tnt for everi ton yu min summar the result and made a seri of report staff member calcul some more ideal model and discov the key in sustain burn of thermonuclear materi this import issu in the h bomb principl was thus resolv 2 speed up the product of thermonuclear materi and the develop of thermonuclear compon anoth import step in the develop of the h bomb was the product of thermonuclear materi and thermonuclear compon just as china was about to instal it first lithium deuterid 6 product line the soviet union cut off aid to china the second ministri of machin build immedi transfer the scientist engag in light isotop separ in the atom energi institut to the baotou nuclear fuel element plant to solv technic problem with assist from the atom energi institut beij univers and qinghua univers plant personnel tackl 95 topic center on the product of thermonuclear materi and solv the problem of the exchang tower enrich process and the product rate of the chemic exchang system meanwhil the first ministri of machin build activ sought out product equip like the reagent pump of the shenyang water pump plant and electrolysi trough and satisfi the need of the lithium deuterid 6 product line instal the instal personnel activ develop instal tool modifi the instal method and complet the instal of the main unit in earli 1963 in spring 1963 the lithium deuterid 6 product line was readi for a test run the intermedi test for heavi water the materi for produc deuterium had basic been accept but industri scale product of heavi water was still not possibl the central special committe request the ministri of chemic industri to includ the project at an earlier date in juli the committe again studi the heavi water problem and decid that the ministri of chemic industri should give top prioriti to small shop for produc heavi water the ministri then organ dalian greas chemic plant and shanghai institut of chemic engin and acceler the process of produc heavi water by electrolyt exchang accept heavi water was produc in decemb 1963 and in may 1964 there was therefor a technolog base for build a heavi water plant subsequ the jilin chemic industri compani quick built a small heavi water product shop and produc the first batch of accept heavi water with strong support from the beij institut of chemic design the first ministri of machin build and other depart in this period the test run of the lithium deuterid 6 product line succeed on the first tri and produc it first batch of product the plant then acquir the abil to produc lithium chlorid and metal lithium and produc deuterium by electrolyt decompos heavi water on 11 septemb 1965 the plant synthes it first charg of lithium deuterid 6 the northwest nuclear weapon develop base was respons for machin lithium deuterid 6 into thermonuclear materi compon for the h bomb accord to the design shape and size in earli 1965 song jiashu 1345 1367 2885 and other scientist began the r d of thermonuclear compon the first problem they encount was the machin of the thermonuclear materi they took a three prongedapproach to break through the technolog after repeat test they settl on a fabric method that could yield near theoret densiti blank with fewer defect at a lower pressur scientist and worker were veri conscious about safeti in their work they proper handl the possibl ignit problem of the thermonuclear materi dure mechan process they also test dozen of coat and final found one coat that help the short term storag problem of thermonuclear compon after almost a year of develop the first set of accept lithium deuterid 6 compon was produc and the fuel problem for the enhanc atom bomb and h bomb test was solv these result were veri crucial for the success develop of the h bomb 3 the first hydrogen bomb success develop in decemb 1965 expert of the northwest nuclear weapon institut conduct a seri of studi these studi were chair by deputi director wu jilin 0702 7139 7207 and particip in by deputi minist leu xiyao 0149 6007 1031 and li jue of the second ministri of machin build and second bureau chief hu ruexia 5170 5387 3838 of the defens scienc commiss after these studi it was determin that the theoret propos of trigger the h bomb with the atom bomb was reason and feasibl accord to the basic principl base on this analysi it was possibl to have a smaller and lighter 1 megaton h bomb with a higher specif fusion at the end of 1967 or the first half of 1968 the emphasi for break through the h bomb technolog was therefor place on the new propos howev the new propos was onli a concept and it success was not ensur on the other hand the origin plan h bomb although larger heavier and have a smaller specif fusion ratio was more like to succeed base on theoret consider for this reason research and test of the origin design was not abandon either with the two prong approach as the guid concept the second ministri of machin build formul the 1966 and 1967 plan for nuclear weapon develop the plan were approv by the central special committe after that the committe approv the specif step to implement the 2 year plan and the request by the relev depart to cooper the new arrang for break through the h bomb technolog develop quick in the new plan the difficult task of trigger the thermonuclear devic with the atom bomb had to be overcom after hundr of deton simul experi and mani in depth academ discuss a clever method employ by chen changyi and tao zucong 7118 4371 5115 solv this technic problem and provid experiment data for the theoret design of the deton to design the bodi of the h bomb physicist and mechan research studi the physic pictur and mechan in the explos process of the thermonuclear devic investig the effect of the explos of the deton bomb on the main h bomb and master the layout of the compon and the relationship of energi releas the theoret design of the h bomb bodi was thus formul howev by the time the theoret design plan for the entir experiment devic was hand to the design and manufactur depart it was alreadi mid octob 1966 the design and manufactur depart had veri littl time to complet the engin design and to fabric the devic furthermor the devic was veri complex with mani odd shape compon which were hard to make to ensur qualiti and schedul theorist design and manufactur work togeth exchang idea discuss problem and move the design and manufactur prepar forward after the complet of the theoreticaldesign plan the design and manufactur move forward togeth to save time by decemb 1966 all the design and manufactur task had been complet howev when scientist inspect the h bomb experiment devic on 10 octob a major compon was found to have qualiti problem when zhou enlai learn of this he sent lie jie to fli in on a special plane on the next day to inspect the problem on site inspect show a crack that was visibl onli with a magnifi glass liu studi with the scientist and determin that the compon was usabl and the crack would not affect the explos test thus the experiment devic was ship to the northwest test site as schedul to ensur the success of the test theoret design and test personnel ad mani monitor for differ part of the thermonuclear devic eight addit near field physic measur were ad and each measur involv mani item under the guidanc of wang ganchang and deputi director hu renyu of the experiment depart test personnel care formul measur procedur and repeat calibr and tune the detector transmiss system and record all measur prepar were readi on time on 28 decemb 1966 the design principl test pass with fli color the result show that china had master the key technolog of h bomb develop howev the thermonuclear reaction of this test was incomplet becaus of the small quantiti of thermonuclear fuel use in the test and becaus of the field limit of the equival in order to understand the paramet of a fulli develop thermonuclear reaction and to further evalu the design principl and it futur prospect the second ministri obtain permiss from the central special committe to conduct a direct full equival air drop h bomb test prepar for this test were to be complet by 20 june 1967 to this end mao zedong sign a telegram author the nuclear weapon base to temporarili halt the big four activ of the great cultur revolut the decis by mao and by the central special committe was vital to the research product qualiti and secur of the h bomb develop close cooper in theori experi design and product on the base acceler the progress and made full use of the facil for develop a thermonuclear bomb and certain other product on 5 june 1967 the h bomb for the offici test was finish the various compon and subsystem of the h bomb were inspect for qualiti befor leav the plant a full equival h bomb test was carri out on 7 june 1967 at the northwest nuclear test site and the test was a success the explos power was equival to 3 million ton of tnt the reduc equival and full equival h bomb test show that china had master the h bomb technolog and was capabl of produc h bomb this was the second major breakthrough in china nuclear weapon develop and was the basi for develop a system of ballist missil and missil equip troop section 4 atom bomb and hydrogen bomb reach applic stage research on a new generat of nuclear weapon the applic of the atom bomb and the h bomb involv convert the experiment nuclear devic into a weapon accord to certain tactic and technic requir it took extens engin research and test to implement the applic in june 1963 the central special committe decid that the weapon product problem after the first nuclear test must be solv in januari the central special committe state in a report to the parti central committe and mao zedong that china should systematicallydevelop atom and hydrogen bomb that could be deliv by missil and aircraft thank to the definit guidanc thought in nuclear weapon develop and the hard work of weapon develop and nuclear fuel produc the progress was relat smooth and the central special committe request were met either in time or ahead of schedul 1 atom bomb reach applic stage a airdrop atom bomb the airborn atom bomb consist of the nuclear devic the deton system and the bomb shell it was close integr with the deliveri aircraft china first nuclear devic was origin design for atmospher explos under the guidanc of guo yonghuai scientist in the nuclear weapon institut began the design in april 1960 and design three aerodynam profil for the bomb shell with the assist of the fifth academi of the ministri of defens and the beij aeronaut institut they conduct a number of low and high speed wind tunnel test and made preliminari decis on the exterior profil and resist coeffici they have also produc a scale air drop model and test it in octob and novemb of 1961 abov the northwest integr missil test base the air drop test of a full size model was conduct late 1962 base on test result an aerodynam profil was final and base on this profil structur design and fabric of the bomb shell proceed after the mode of test for the first nuclear devic was chang to a tower explos research on the air drop atom bomb continu in 1963 the nuclear weapon institut collabor with a unit in the air forc to conduct flight test for the deton control system after a number of improv the deton control system was complet by the nuclear weapon institut in earli 1965 after china first success nuclear test scientist at the nuclear weapon institut improv upon the theoret model of the nuclear devic base on the tactic and technic requir of air drop bomb and rais the reliabl of the structur led by shu songgui 3990 2646 2710 and yu daguang 0205 1129 0342 design complet the design of

approv by huang kecheng on 10 januari the general polit depart pick cadr with sound polit and militari train for the nuclear test team from the servic militari school and the various militari region the general staff headquart dispatch troop from shenyang beij and jinan militari region to the nuclear test site by the end of may the nuclear test team was basic establish south of where the troop were station was a prairi with malan flower in full bloom at the suggest of zhang yunyu the offic and live quarter was name malan for the hardi flower that surviv and bloom in the desert 2 overcom difficulti in build the test base in mid june 1959 the nuclear test base held it first expand meet chair by the parti secretari chang yong of the base the meet review the survey and site effort of the previous 10 month and decid that the main mission for the second half of 1959 was to focus on the construct prepar and get readi for the ground break in 1960 at the same time the ideolog style of the troop was improv and organiz and vocat work was carri out on 27 novemb the communist parti central secretariat listen to the brief of the central militari commiss regard the site of the test base and the construct progress of the base the secretariat approv the construct plan and request that the base be built as soon as possibl to acceler the base construct the ministri of defens decid to assign the engin construct mission to the special engin command sec of the engin the xinjiang militari region assign 2 200 new soldier to the base the sec assign four engin battalion and one vehicl battalion to base construct a construct team of more than 30 000 peopl was form from the abov unit and the follow unit lanzhou no 2 construct compani the tianjin construct compani and the construct brigad of the second divis of the xinjiang product construct armi group in addit the no 273 hospit in guangzhou militari region was transfer to the nuclear test base to serv the construct worker on 1 april 1960 under the leadership of the sec the base construct began the major construct project were road construct from the live quarter to the experiment center zone and the command control zone establish communic line build a land strip barrack power plant and associ facil two major difficulti were encount soon after the begin of construct first the soviet union tore up the agreement and halt it aid so the design and equip specifi in the agreement were not forthcom face with this difficulti zhang aip follow the instruct from nie rongzhen and immedi organ armi unit to work on the engin design and construct of the base the defens engin design institut of the engin troop use the preliminari soviet design as a refer and began a technic design that suit the chines situat the signal corp the engin command and the nuclear test base joint conduct communic and control test between the control zone and the experiment central zone chief hu ruoxia of the second bureau of the defens scienc commiss organ relev engin and technic personnel and evalu the design of the test zone the relev personnel came from the defens engin design institut of the engin the communic troop of the general staff headquart and technic staff at the nuclear test base and the 9th bureau of the second ministri of machin build to ascertain the util and specif of the special equip and to organ develop and product the defens scienc commiss form a lead group head by zhang yunyu after a few month an inventori was made for the equip of known util and specif but there remain some key measur equip whose test method and measur function would have to wait until after result were obtain in the atom bomb develop for this reason the construct design of the nuclear test base was still not avail at the end of 1962 the second difficulti encount in the base construct was that china happen to be in a period of financi difficulti there was a shortag of invest construct materi construct machineri and associ tool labor forc and transport vehicl the defens scienc commiss ask the base to recogn the nation difficulti and make do with avail resourc the base scale down some of the capit construct and the construct troop did everyth possibl to overcom obstacl and get the job done to combat the lack of vehicl one command of an engin regiment carri rock for road construct on his back without enough mechan tool the troop fix and fashion tool by hand one engin regiment did not have a larg crane to build their plant so they made a hoist themselv and move 11 ton concret structur member there were not enough steamrol so reinforc concret roller were pull by men to compact the road base to keep the suppli of materi equip and live necess flow peopl in charg of logist were out hustl transport was difficult on the gobi desert grain had to be haul from nanjiang 1 700 km away and the round trip took one month transport the larg amount of materi use for construct the base was a formid task driver drove fulli load truck through desert mountain and windi pass local worker particip in the construct were fearless and cooper fulli with the troop by the end of 1962 564 km of road had been built in the experiment zone and where the troop were station barrack and plant build exceed 100 000 squar meter a simpl airport had been built and 1 800 km of communic line had been set up for communic within the base and between the base and urumqi and beij the nuclear test base was take shape section 2 explos test of the first atom bomb on 16 octob 1964 china success explod it first atom bomb thus erect a mileston on the

and recommend that zero hour be set at 8 00 zhou approv but at 4 30 on the 8th weather forecast found in the sens inform that the high altitud wind over the test site had shift from northwest to northeast and test condit were not met zhang zhenhuan and zhang yunyu then immedi had their peopl calcul the possibl contamin region result show that the test site would be contamin if the test took place at 6 am zhang aip immedi place a call to zhou enlai to report the situat zhou immedi order a halt to the test and chang the status to readi although the test did not take place on the 8th a general inspect did it was a practic demonstr more practic than the comprehens rehears the practic demonstr prove that the prepar had been done well and that the system could endur the real test moreov it also improv the command experi 3 success airburst test of first atom bomb dure the wait period the various unit took protect measur for the nuclear bomb projectil the aircraft expens instrument and specimen the test committe continu to focus on the weather condit after work around the clock for sever day a forecast came at 2 30 on 14 may that there would be a brief period of good weather from 9 00 to 12 00 oclock on 14 may the test committe then bold decid that 9 30 14 may would be zero hour the decis was report to zhou enlai and luo ruiq and they approv the decis the zero hour inform was then given to the air forc command and the northwest nuclear weapon develop base upon receiv the inform they made a final inspect of the assembl atom bomb and hung it in the bomb bay of the aircraft respons personnel at various level sign their name at the test site the final prepar was complet in onli 5 and one half hour at 30 second past 8 30 li yuanyi and yu fuhai took off with the bomb at 9 26 yu fuhai report see the target marker at a distanc of 50 km to ensur accuraci and to make sure that ground instrument and effect test instrument could obtain reliabl data the flight plan call for the plane to enter the target zone three time after find the target marker yu fuhai comput the drop and aim at the target base on aircraft altitud speed wind speed and wind direct yu fuhai flew over the target twice and report the aim situat and the comput data to ground command the command post then order the aircraft to make the third entri the arm switch was turn on at 9 53 at 9 57 the atom bomb was connect to it power sourc at 9 58 40 the automat bomb releas was activ and the atom bomb was releas at 9 59 10 due to the sudden loss of weight the plane jerk up and the atom bomb was head straight to the target at 9 59 38 the atom bomb explod in the air abov the target marker as plan the nuclear weapon experi institut and the artilleri effect team immedi made rapid measur of the natur of the explos it altitud project point and power preliminari result were report within 10 minut the explos altitud was about 500 meter the explos project point was about 135 meter from the target center the azimuth was 232 degre and the explos power was greater than 30 000 ton of tnt equival zhang aip immedi spoke to zhou enlai and luo ruiq on the phone and report the preliminari result zhou and luo were veri pleas and congratul all the peopl who had particip in the test zhou also congratul the bomber crew three minut after the explos the first radiat observ eschelon of the first chemic compani of the nuclear test base left it posit and move toward the explos zone twenti minut after the explos a report on the dosag in the contamin zone was avail three hour after the explos various unit follow the plan and systemat recov numer item tactic demonstr team came through the explos zone 8 hour after the explos and gain some understand of tactic action use atom explos effect there were 3 250 man time of entri into the contamin zone and not one person exceed the allow dosag standard by observ the damag situat of the test articl a limit of the kill power was obtain all necessari inform was obtain in this one test outsid the nuclear test site various depart conduct plan test and prove that there was veri littl surfac particul contamin all dosag were within the allow rang to prais and encourag the peopl who had particip in the develop and test of the nuclear weapon the communist parti central committe and nation leader zhou enlai lin biao chen yi he long nie rongzhen and luo ruiq receiv the depart leader scientist technic expert and pilot in the great hall of the peopl on 30 may section 4 test of missil with nuclear warhead to test a missil with a nuclear warhead the missil serv as the carrier and a nuclear warhead is deliv to a target locat to caus a nuclear explos on 27 octob 1966 china success deliv an atom bomb with a medium to short rang missil and conduct a nuclear explos test it mark the possess of practic missil warhead weapon by china 1 a care decis on 5 decemb 1963 the central special committe made a decis that china nuclear weapon develop should be base main on missil deliv warhead supplement by aircraft deliv warhead to link up the atom bomb technolog with the missil technolog technic discuss and coordin were held by scientist and engin from the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build and the fifth academi of the ministri of defens these activ were organ by the central special committe the defens industri offic and the defens scienc commiss r d effort were initi accord to technic topic sinc china had no experi in this area it had to go through a learn process in evalu the perform of the missil atom warhead initi the nuclear weapon institut believ that an atom bomb would be readi for instal on a medium to short rang missil after ground simul test for missil flight environ deton test full rang flight test of the deton control system and underground test of the perform of the nuclear warhead for this reason the third nuclear test arrang by the defens scienc commiss was an underground test the purpos was to determin the power and perform paramet of the medium to short rang missil with an atom warhead in novemb 1965 the defens scienc commiss and the second ministri of machin build did some in depth analysi and decid that the underground test could not test whether the atom bomb would satisfi the actual flight condit in order to develop nuclear warhead that could surviv the flight test the underground test was temporarili put on hold instead a cold test under flight condit would be conduct onc there was strong confid a hot flight test would be made in term of actual need the hot flight test would be best conduct at full equival and full rang so as to test the combin of the atom bomb and missil technolog on 13 decemb the second ministri made such a suggest to the central special committe at the end of decemb zhou enlai chair the central special committe meet and care studi the suggest zhou ask the defens scienc commiss to make up sever scenario and make some comparison for the committe to evalu in februari 1966 the defens scienc commiss invit leader from the second and seventh ministri of machin build the general staff the equip plan depart the northwest general missil test base and the nuclear test base to studi the test propos of the modifi medium to short rang surfac to surfac missil with nuclear warhead the meet decid that neither ground simul test nor underground explos test could truli simul the actual fight condit to test the combin of the missil and the atom bomb a cold flight test could not evalu the actual condit of the atom bomb dure flight a full rang full power hot test with a normal trajectori and a low altitud explos would not onli achiev the test goal but would also conform to actual war condit in term of reliabl and test safeti the modifi medium to short rang missil had it own self destruct devic if a malfunct occur dure the power part of the flight a signal could be sent from the ground to destroy the missil the nuclear warhead had a safeti switch and the switch would not open if the warhead fell off dure flight the bomb bodi would be destroy upon impact the ground but there would not be a nuclear fission reaction so the hot test was feasibl from a safeti point of view it was therefor decid that a cold test would be made as a practic run follow by a hot test in the meet specif studi were also made for the launch site the target zone the rang the explos altitud the test item and the divis of task on 26 februari the defens scienc commiss report the studi result to the central special committe on 11 march zhou enlai chair a central special committe meet and care studi the defens scienc commiss report base on the technolog level at the time and the desir to quick develop and test a missil warhead the central special committe agre to the test plan propos by the defens scienc commiss the committe ask the scienc commiss to organ the second and seventh ministri and conduct more preparatori test so that the test could be guarante absolut safe the commiss also set a date of the end of august for complet all preparatori test 2 care prepar in order to guarante the absolut safeti of the hot flight test of the nuclear warhead missil the defens scienc commiss the offic of defens industri and the second and seventh ministri of machin build made care prepar in march and june 1966 the defens scienc commiss twice review the technic plan launch plan measur plan and accid handl plan and set a progress schedul for field engin weather communic aviat and logist task meanwhil special topic studi and arrang were also made for the polit work of the test mission the offic of defens industri also call a number of meet of the second and seventh ministri to studi the develop and test of the missil and warhead problem that aros in the coordin were resolv in a time manner the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build conduct a seri of test for the nuclear devic and the deton control system it also revisit the reliabl of the deton system and the self destruct system and conclud that reliabl was assur plant and institut of the seventh ministri of machin build complet the product mission on schedul and maintain high qualiti they also conduct self destruct test of the bomb and prove that the safeti system function reliabl the northwest general missil test base propos a launch plan select the launch posit built a temporari launch pad underground control and command room and personnel shield structur and began oper practic the nuclear test base select the target zone built rudimentari road to the target zone construct measur station propos measur plan and made arrang to measur the explos posit and explos power the two base respect formul safeti measur for the launch posit and the target zone on 30 june on his way back to beij from an oversea trip zhou enlai stop by the northwest general missil test base view the launch test for the medium to short rang missil and inspect the prepar for the nuclear weapon test on 5 septemb nie rongzhen was brief by the defens scienc commiss and leader of particip unit and inspect the complet of the prepar on the 12th zhang zhenhuan led some worker to the two base to inspect the prepar and put the test plan and safeti measur on a solid basi on the 15th the general polit depart approv the format of a parti committe for the missil bomb test zhang zhenhuan was name the first deputi secretari and li zaishan 2698 0375 1472 and zhang yunyu were the deputi secretari from 24 to 29 septemb the launch zone and the target zone conduct a number of time synchron logist communic and signal exchang and joint launch practic through these practic the oper becam familiar with procedur and command relationship and actual check the test facil control system wire and wireless communic system and circuit in the target zone inaccur call out by command personnel sluggish hand oper and malfunct of individu instrument were correct on 25 septemb zhou enlai again chair the central special committe meet and in principl approv the arrang of the defens scienc commiss to conduct joint self destruct test in octob cold flight test in mid octob and to determin the date for the hot test base on the result of the abov two test the central special committe also order the defens scienc commiss to form a joint group for unifi command to temporarili evacu the 10 000 resid under the flight path of the missil at the end of septemb the missil and warhead use for the self destruct test and for the cold flight test arriv at the northwest general missil test base test at the base and communic dure the test weather aviat medic care protect and smoke and cloud detect outsid the test site had all been proper handl the safeti of the resid was put on a solid basi to ensur that the hot flight of the combin test was failur proof a combin flight test was conduct at the northwest general missil test base on 7 octob to evalu the safeti self destruct system after the launch all the instrument on the missil and on the ground function normal follow the plan procedur trajectori and time the warhead was first destroy in the air follow by the destruct of the missil bodi the target zone also went through a normal procedur exercis the test result show that the missil function normal and the safeti self destruct system was reliabl the goal of the test had been achiev on 8 octob zhou enlai chair a central special committe meet and heard zhang zhenhuan report on the combin test the self destruct experi and the prepar for the cold and hot flight test zhou was also brief on the weather forecast for octob zhou point out that sinc the test was to be conduct on land there could be no accid the cold test had to be care inspect the hot had to be even more care monitor everi step had to be 100 percent problem free the nuclear warhead had to go through impact test includ obliqu impact and later impact the warhead had to be guarante not to explod under various anomal condit the cold flight was schedul around the 15th test result had to be submit within 2 or 3 day so that chairman mao could make up his mind zhou assign zhang zhenhuan to be respons for this test at 8 33 on 13 octob the first cold test missil was success launch at 1730 on the 16th a second cold test missil was launch load with simul warhead these two missil made normal flight the deton control system work reliabl and the explos compon were deton at the plan altitud abov the target zone the reliabl of the missil and the deton control system was again verifi in these two cold test all formal procedur and step were execut in the launch zone and the target zone the test serv as overal check for all the preparatori work 3 combin test on 12 octob zhou enlai call a special meet and togeth with nie rongzhen ye jiani and yang chengwu was brief by zhang zhenhuan about detail of the launch zone inspect and target zone prepar join by leader of the relev depart and expert they again made an across the board review of the test prepar and safeti issu ye point out that the success of that test would attract great attent in china the hot test was the final test and everyth had to be check care includ everi screw and human error had to be elimin zhou stress that the test must be fail safe and assign nie rongzhen to take charg of the launch nie arriv at the northwest general missil test base on 25 octob and heard a brief on the test situat of the missil and the warhead he inspect the test prepar and relay mao zedong instruct given in the previous even when mao heard nie brief mao said that the upcom test could succeed or fail but it would not matter even if it fail nie took mao comment to mean that peopl should prepar for the worst but do their best to succeed nie ask the lead cadr to carri out mao instruct and care execut the final prepar at 1600 hour the test committe studi the weather forecast for the next 48 hour in the launch zone and the target zone it was deep autumn weather and the wind was strong at the launch zone the forecast was that weather would improv after daybreak on the 26th nie agre with the opinion of the test committe that the formal launch should be schedul for the 27th at the launch site the test team care complet all test for the missil and made sure that all the technic specif were met scientist of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base repeat and rigor inspect and test each compon with assist from scientist of the first academi of the seventh ministri of machin build final assembl of the nuclear warhead was care check out at about 9 oclock on the 26th the test committe determin that the launch time would be 9 oclock on the 27th zhou enlai approv this launch time and ask peopl to calm do their job launch team no 2 under the leadership of yan zhenq 7346 2182 3237 accur carri out sever hundr oper all prepar fulli met the requir the nuclear missil was readi for launch at 2 am on the 27th the target zone sudden had 6 7 grade strong wind this weather chang was not good for safeti in the target zone zhang yunyu be in charg of the target zone prepar for the worst case scenario and organ peopl for emerg evacu prepar meanwhil he kept a close eye on the weather at this key moment the weather depart of the base made real time observ of the weather and after rigor calcul determin that the strong wind would move out of the target zone at 8 oclock at a speed of 50 km hr the weather would then turn fair that forecast turn out to be veri accur and the strong wind inde move out of the region at about 8 oclock at about 9 oclock the launch command gave the launch order immedi the missil was ignit and leap into the air follow the program it ascend turn and flew in a westward direct after separ from the missil bodi the warhead flew toward the target zone as program the observ instrument in the target zone aim at the incom warhead and the remot sens instrument receiv radio signal for target acquir and remot sens signal normal at 09 09 14 the nuclear warhead explod abov the target zone at an altitud of 569 meter it turn into an incandesc firebal and emit a blind flash after some violent churn of smoke and cloud a mushroom cloud slowli rose all the measur instrument in the target zone function well and obtain data preliminari test result show that the explos power was in agreement with the theoret design valu the test was a success the success of this test show that china now had a practic nuclear missil it was high signific for china in term of an acceler pace for nuclear weapon develop and a stronger nation power in the meantim china also gain the full experi of develop a nuclear warhead after that other model of china surfac to surfac nuclear warhead did not go through this type of actual flight test section 5 first hydrogen bomb test on 28 decemb 1966 2 year and 2 month after it first atom bomb test china success explod it first hydrogen bomb on a tower in lop nur half a year after that on 17 june 1967 china conduct it first success hydrogen bomb airburst test 1 first hydrogen bomb principl test at the end of decemb 1965 the central special committe approv a principl explos test of a hydrogen bomb to be conduct around the end of 1966 in earli april 1966 the defens scienc commiss organ a studi of the principl test for a hydrogen bomb after analysi and debat it was conclud that the spare steel tower for the first atom bomb test could be use for the hydrogen bomb principl test the engin research institut was to redesign the room for instal the hydrogen bomb and the hoist system in the meantim the measur requir of the hydrogen bomb principl test were studi new measur item were ad and the measur task were assign to various unit subsequ the nuclear test base decid the posit of the steel tower and formul the experiment plan new measur item were determin and need instrument were arrang in mid june the defens scienc commiss review the experiment plan discuss the safeti measur for nearbi resid in the downwind direct and investig the effect test plan the commiss ask that prepar for the test be complet by 1 decemb the central special committe approv the test plan and work assign of the defens scienc commiss prepar continu at the test site by the particip unit engin prepar this test involv a total of 113 engin project and need 1 400 kilomet of electr cabl the test base use onli 5 month to complet the project with accept qualiti the steel tower construct began on 18 june and was complet at the end of octob the total number of work day was less than 100 and it took 80 day less to construct than the first tower measur prepar the main issu of the measur prepar were to determin which measur data should be use to evalu the success of the hydrogen bomb test and which techniqu should be use to acquir these data theoret design and measur expert discuss and formul the test item to evalu the work condit of the hydrogen bomb in the initi phase four new test item were ad these task were accomplish by the cooper of a number of institut includ the nuclear weapon institut the atom energi institut the physic institut of the chines academi of scienc the shanghai institut of optic and fine mechan the xian institut of optic and fine mechan the changchun institut of optic and fine mechan and zhejiang univers the effort was led by the nuclear weapon test institut the test employ 1 014 piec of instrument and requir onli 1 month to finish the on site instal safeti and protect compar with previous test this test was character by greater power lower explos point and greater surfac contamin the power of the hydrogen test was hamper by the steel tower and other field condit even with reduc load of fission and fusion materi in the design it explos power was still 5 to 6 time greater than china first atom bomb to reduc the impact of radioact fallout on the test zone and the downwind direct expert from the health depart of the defens scienc commiss and the militari medic colleg made exhaust studi of safeti issu their consensus was that the test would not affect the health of the resid studi by cheng kaijia and other had shown that the weather condit at the test must be care chosen in addit the ground surfac within 230 meter of the tower base must be reinforc with cement and rock to reduc the amount of loos soil swept into the cloud simul test made with convent explos show that these measur were equival to rais the steel tower by 60 meter the safeti of the test was assur test the explos effect to further investig the effect of the hydrogen bomb explos on structur and weapon and to studi the biolog effect the defens scienc commiss organ 16 militari unit and arrang 81 test use 1 377 articl of 158 differ type test command and logist protect in formul the test plan for this test the nuclear test base recogn the complex and safeti requir of the test prepar were initi for communic air travel weather action plan safeti protect emerg evacu and result recoveri the test was conduct in a cold winter and the air temperatur at the test zone was about 22\ufffdc below zero the test base prepar for personnel and equip protect against the cold they organ 68 food servic unit store 100 000 kilogram of veget and maintain a drink water suppli use 50 water truck have direct the nuclear missil test at the northwest general missil test base nie rongzhen came to the nuclear test base again on 31 octob and inspect the prepar for the hydrogen bomb principl test he telegraph zhou enlai and report the remain weak link in the test and argu strong for conduct the test in decemb or the follow januari follow zhous order the second ministri of machin build made an extens review of the product of the hydrogen bomb devic the defens scienc commiss sent hu ruogu to the northwest nuclear weapon develop base to solv some problem in the test prepar becaus of the tight schedul hu consult with the test base and air forc leader and decid to fli the hydrogen bomb to the test site on 11 decemb zhou enlai chair a central special committe meet and agre in principl to the arrang made by the defens scienc commiss and the second ministri zhou agre to a test date in late decemb or earli januari the meet stress that becaus the radioact contamin of the test must be tight control the test had to be conduct in the right weather on the surfac and at high altitud contamin of the test zone and the downwind direct had to be prevent as much as possibl the central special committe also assign zhang zhenhuan as the chief command of the test after the prepar were basic readi an all site joint practic and a comprehens rehears were conduct respect on 18 and 20 decemb problem reveal in the practic were resolv the hydrogen bomb devic to be use in the formal test was deliv to the test zone at 5 20 on 21 decemb assembl of the bomb was complet on the 25th and nie rongzhen flew into the test zone on the 26th to direct the test in the afternoon of the 26th the hydrogen bomb devic was hoist up the tower in the even nie rongzhen studi the weather with zhang zhenhuan and other member of the test committe zero hour was set at 12 00 of the 28th at 19 00 on the 27th zhou enlai telegraph his approv from 2100 on the 27th to the earli morn of the 28th the deton of the hydrogen bomb was instal after inspect the exterior and compon of the hydrogen bomb instal withdrew from the tower at 12 00 on 28th the hydrogen bomb explod on schedul a larg amount of data were taken after the explos particular data on the thermonuclear reaction process the reaction rate of the lithium deuterid 6 and the fusion power base on the integr analysi of the measur data the explos power was estim to be 122 000 ton of tnt equival the test was a success this test was a hydrogen bomb surfac test whether one consid the theori the structur or the measur data and result the success was proof that china had master the key technolog for make the hydrogen bomb it was anoth mileston in china nuclear weapon develop histori after the unit state the soviet union and the unit kingdom china becam the fourth nation in the world to master hydrogen bomb technolog becaus the weather and protect depart of the nuclear test base had chosen the appropri wind direct to conduct the test the central axi of the radioact cloud miss the residenti area downwind from the explos after the explos from 1500 hour 28 decemb to 30 decemb the air forc flew 27 sorti accord to the plan radioact cloud and smoke were survey at differ altitud measur result show that the radioact smoke and cloud did not caus ani advers effect in the region they pass over 2 first hydrogen bomb airburst test from 30 to 31 decemb 1966 nie rongzhen held a meet at the nuclear test base the meet was attend by qian xuesen peng huanwu zhu guangya chen nengkuan cheng kaijia yu min zhou guangzhao and fang zhengzhi these expert all agre that the hydrogen bomb principl test was a success they recommend that base on the design principl structur and bomb bodi the next step should be the develop of a million ton full power hydrogen bomb for airburst this approach should be recogn as the direct for futur medium rang and long rang surfac to surfac hydrogen bomb warhead after some more discuss it was decid that the hydrogen bomb airburst test should be conduct befor 1 octob 1967 in earli februari 1967 sever scientist in the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build suggest to hu ruogu and zhu guangya that the theoret design of the full power hydrogen bomb could be final in februari and the test date should be move forward they want to explod the hydrogen bomb by 1 juli befor the french could explod their bomb the defens scienc commiss care studi the situat with the second ministri the nuclear test base and the air forc and brief zhou enlai and nie rongzhen on 20 februari about the prepar progress for the first airburst test of the hydrogen bomb the commiss suggest that the test be conduct befor 1 juli zhou and nie consent to the new schedul the nuclear test base and the northwest nuclear weapon develop base then formul their respect execut plan and prepar for the test began in march the carrier for the test was a hong 6a aircraft the parachut equip bomb was to be drop and the explos was to take place at an altitud of 3 000 meter this was refer to as the aircraft chute bomb test accord to theoret design the power of the hydrogen bomb should be between 15 million and 3 million ton of tnt equival the bomb shell was design by the northwest nuclear weapon develop base and the bomb bodi part were manufactur by the surfac to surfac missil assembl plant of the seventh ministri of machin build the parachut was develop by the no 513 plant of the third ministri of machin build modif of the bomb rack of the two hong 6as was made by a modif group consist of personnel from the air forc the second ministri and the third ministri with the xian aircraft plant of the third ministri take the lead these unit all accomplish their develop manufactur and modif task for the bomb parachut and aircraft after modif the hong 6as particip in a flight test to evalu it parachut and to verifi the trajectori the test was conduct from 15 march to 3 april at the northwest general missil test base test result show that the trajectori met the design requir and the control system on the bomb function normal the parachut structur strength and open sequenc were normal after some revis and repeat test the design was final and the parachut was put into product in earli april this test also prove that the modifi aircraft could satisfi requir the nuclear test base sent peopl to particip in the test and to becom familiar with the oper of the aircraft parachut and bomb these activ form the basi for the formal test this test was character by the high power of the bomb and by the high explos altitud an import compon of the test was to ensur the safeti of the aircraft and the insid and outsid of the test site the defens scienc commiss form an aircraft safeti comput group with personnel from the northwest nuclear weapon develop base the third ministri of machin build the nuclear weapon institut and the air forc command the group made care calcul for the safeti of the pilot and the aircraft base on the specifi flight altitud speed bomb drop condit and explos altitud they conclud that the aircraft and the personnel would be safe for an explos power of up to 4 million ton of tnt equival heed the request of the defens scienc commiss the nuclear test base care investig the safeti problem within and without the test zone learn from previous nuclear test a strict safeti protect plan was formul under the guidanc of the general staff weather bureau the test base formul a complet weather protect plan a weather forecast network was form by the general staff weather bureau the lanzhou air

shock wave light radiat earli nuclear radiat and nuclear electromagnet puls take place main within 1 minut of the explos they are instantan destruct effect radioact contamin on the other hand act over a long time and spread over a larg area it can caus consider damag to personnel therefor the first thing to consid in atmospher nuclear test is the protect against radioact precipit and radiat it not onli affect the acquisit of test result and safeti of personnel in the test zone but also involv the safeti of the chines peopl and the peopl of neighbor countri the chines communist parti central committe and the chines govern pay a great deal of attent on it china has care studi the safeti problem ever sinc the survey of the nuclear test site the lop nur area is in the immens gobi desert and has no settlement the reason that lop nur was chosen as the nuclear test site was that it distanc from citi prevent and minim radioact precipit hazard to personnel everi time the defens scienc commiss arrang an atmospher nuclear test it organ specialist and technic staff to make exhaust studi of test safeti and to formul the test plan and protect measur the mode of test was care chosen the mode was general air burst and at the highest altitud possibl the dust column from the explos on the ground and the cloud should not be connect this would great reduc the amount of radioact particl in the cloud and the degre of radioact contamin in the test site and in the downwind area outsid the test site when the test mode had to be surfac explos or tower explos the number of test and the explos power were care control 1 safeti and protect at the test site and it vicin in china first nuclear test the test parti committe formul safeti and protect regul and took strict measur for safeti for exampl when the nuclear explos took place all the test personnel gather in a safe zone to observ after the explos the number of peopl enter the contamin zone was strict control personnel enter the contamin zone had gone through difficult and rigor train befor the test personnel and equip leav the contamin zone were care inspect in a design area and thorough de contamin these practic ensur the success of the first nuclear test and have been strict adher to and improv upon in the follow test when high power nuclear explos test were conduct in the atmospher the nuclear test base sent personnel to nearbi settlement point to organ safeti protect and to conduct dosag measur sinc all the test were conduct with wester wind near the earth surfac of the test site the live quarter and assembl area west of the test site and up wind region nearbi were basic not contamin investig were made to ascertain whether the radioact materi releas in the nuclear test had caus local environment contamin and whether they pose a health hazard to local resid from 1982 to 1987 a 6 year studi was made in residenti region near the test site and in control region these studi were made by 40 scientist from the follow unit the health and protect station of the xinjiang radiat medicin offic the hami region immunolog station the altay region immunolog station and the nuclear weapon institut the region of investig near the nuclear test site refer to the nearest villag from the lop nur test site in differ direct the nearest one was 120 km and the farthest one was 400 km the rest of them were about 200 km away the control region were locat at about 700 to 1 000 km from the test site the environ of the investig region and the control region were basic the same except for the degre of contamin by the nuclear test after comprehens care and exhaust investig the follow conclus were reach the nuclear test did not caus notic local contamin of residenti area and the test had no detriment effect on the health of the resid the radioact level of foodstuff produc in the region near the test site was within safe limit 2 safeti and protect downwind from test site while pay attent to safeti in the test site and the surround area china also paid great attent to the safeti area in the downwind direct outsid the test area in china first nuclear test on a tower in octob 1964 the explos time was chosen to be in the afternoon so that it would be deep into the night when the radioact cloud drift over settl area downwind from the test site this way direct contact with the radioact dust particl by personnel and anim could be avoid aerial sampl and surfac monitor of the radioact after the explos show that there was slight radioact fallout in area under the radioact cloud but the valu was still within the safeti threshold and no harm was done to local resid even so zhou enlai was still concern on 2 novemb 1964 after hear the report of the first nuclear test zhou order an escal of the monitor of radioact fallout outsid the test site he also point out that there should be more surfac sampl point for radioact fallout between 20 degre north latitud and 60 degre north latitud monitor station should be place at lhasa chengdu wuhan guangzhou and shanghai in the south urumqi yumen hami lanzhou baotou hohhot chengd jin zhangjiakou baichengzi harbin manzhouli hailar and mishan in the north liaodong peninsula shandong peninsula and along the yalu river in the middl in the air sampl should be taken along three line in the east the southeast and northeast other sampl should be taken for fresh water sea water veget plant and fruit the defens scienc commiss thorough implement zhous instruct to ascertain the direct of cloud movement develop trend and radioact dosag the defens scienc commiss detect sampl and measur the radioact cloud outsid the test zone with aircraft equip with self record micro roentgen meter and with radiat monitor weather balloon this monitor was done with the particip of the general staff weather bureau the general staff chemic troop the air forc and the atom energi institut in each of the nuclear test they follow the forecast of radioact cloud movement and acquir sampl along three line in the east southeast and northeast sampl were taken at three altitud in the 23 atmospher nuclear test china conduct the air forc flew a total of 485 sorti use 283 aircraft of six differ model begin in 1967 weather station in region pass by the radioact cloud deploy radiat weather balloon accord to the direct and speed of the cloud to reduc the radioact fallout in region downwind from the test site the defens scienc commiss also agre to have the general staff weather bureau enhanc the forecast of cloud movement and made precipit in region pass by the cloud one of the consider in decid a test date for exampl the larg atmospher nuclear explos that took place on 29 septemb 1969 was origin schedul for 26 septemb howev in the morn of the 26th the weather chang forecast had the radioact cloud move along the border and into a neighbor countri as it move in the downwind direct at 6 am zhou enlai heard the report of leader of the defens scienc commiss and decid to conduct the test on a differ date in order to assur the safeti of resid in a neighbor countri the decis was first report to mao zedong and his approv was obtain to assess the dust fallout situat in china after the nuclear test the ministri of health establish the industri hygien institut as a nation center and built 46 environment radiat monitor station around the countri in each nuclear test these station measur the amount of dust fallout radioact concentr in near surfac air radioact in rain water and water sourc the degre of contamin of veget and gamma ray dosag at the ground surfac to studi the long term effect of radioact contamin the ministri of health made two larg scale survey in 1975 and 1977 respect on the radiat exposur and health situat of resid in dunhuan and jiuquan the survey were conduct by the industri hygien institut of the ministri of health the industri hygien institut of gansu and chemic troop in the lanzhou militari region in june 1979 these unit made a comprehens analysi of the monitor data and resid health data collect in the various nuclear test the conclus was that radiat exposur of the resid was minor it was less than the natur radiat background of the region and also less than the limit set in the radiat protect regul in comparison studi there was also no evid that the resid health had been affect by the dust fallout of the nuclear test china has acquir a great amount of data on aerial radioact cloud and radioact dust fallout outsid the test zone in it mani atmospher nuclear test it has learn the movement behavior of radioact cloud and the characterist of radioact fallout it has also found empir calcul method for forecast the path and concentr of radioact cloud and the contamin of ground air and rain water by fallout these find were crucial for the protect of troop movement and resid safeti base on the measur data and analysi of radiat dosag in downwind area it was conclud that china nuclear test pose no danger to the popul of neighbor countri in the downwind direct becaus china paid so much attent to the health and safeti of the popul within and without china and work so hard on safeti and protect all it 23 nuclear test were conduct safe section 8 underground nuclear test in underground nuclear test the nuclear devic is buri at a certain depth underground and then deton general there are two type of underground test tunnel nuclear test and shaft nuclear test compar to atmospher nuclear test underground test requir a higher degre of technolog more construct work and a higher cost howev they have certain uniqu advantag such test not onli contain the radioact product underground which is desir in term of environment protect and secreci but also facilit the collect of radioact product sampl in particular physic diagnost measur may be carri out veri close to the nuclear devic result of underground test are use for improv nuclear weapon design and for studi the linear destruct effect of radiat these data are indispens in the theoret research and design of nuclear weapon the move from atmospher test to underground test was necessit by the object need of nuclear weapon develop 1 tunnel test in a tunnel test a special design long tunnel is dug into a mountain the nuclear devic and various probe are instal in the tunnel after the tunnel is fill and seal in a special way the nuclear devic is deton follow instruct from zhou enlai the second ministri of machin build and the defens scienc commiss made a preliminari investig of the underground nuclear test problem later the defens scienc commiss follow the decis of the central special committe and organ the nuclear test base to formul a plan for nuclear test in tunnel and in shaft to this end zhang yunyu zhang zhishang and zhang ying did a care site select for underground nuclear test and propos that the site for the tunnel test be chosen at nanshan in the nuclear test base the propos was approv by zhou enlai in earli 1965 an extens studi was organ by the defens scienc commiss and the site of the nanshan underground test was final the studi was conduct by the defens engin design institut of the engin the geolog institut of the chines academi of scienc the ministri of petroleum and the ministri of geolog the studi investig the geolog the hydrogeolog the rock chemistri and the mechan properti of rock later the nuclear weapon institut conduct theoret calcul for the propag of shock wave in rock and for the self seal mechan of the tunnel simul test were perform for chemic explos and the theoret paramet were unifi and revis these activ were the technic prepar for the underground nuclear test china origin plan to conduct it first underground test use a tunnel in may 1966 later the plan was temporarili halt by the central special committe becaus china want to come up with a flight test warhead as soon as possibl and to concentr resourc on the technolog breakthrough of the hydrogen bomb after the first success air burst test of china hydrogen bomb in 1967 the defens scienc commiss held detail discuss with expert includ wang ganchang and cheng kaijia in octob and novemb regard the object test item and engin requir for china first underground test it was decid that the princip object of china first tunnel nuclear test was to explor the characterist of china underground nuclear test and to conduct near field physic measur of the nuclear bomb in order to provid data for improv nuclear bomb design in may 1965 the construct and progress of the various task were coordin at the nuclear test base after redefin the task the construct for the underground test continu in the spring of 1969 becaus of technic requir there were a number of modif the tunnel construct involv extens engin complex technolog limit work surfac and high risk in view of these characterist the nuclear test base organ an engin command a technic guidanc command and a tool and materi suppli command and establish a sound construct procedur worker were fearless and work around the clock in the hot and stuffi tunnel togeth they improv the technolog and complet 54 experiment engin project in june accord to plan and meet qualiti standard test and scientif experiment were arrang by the nuclear weapon design academi and the nuclear weapon institut after 2 month they complet the instal and test of 400 piec of equip in earli septemb to assur safeti the defens scienc commiss met at the test site in april 1969 and work on technic measur that would prevent mishap in the test such as blow the top jump the gun misfir and dud in the even of 10 august the central special committe heard the report of deputi command zhang ying of the nuclear test base regard the prepar of the test site zhou enlai stress that the test must be done safe so that accid such as blow the top and leak of radioact materi could be avoid the nuclear test base again calcul the resist and wave absorpt in the tunnel and analyz the various extern environ factor and they were sure that the prevent measur taken would prevent jump the gun on 15 septemb the nuclear devic was place in the explos chamber and the tunnel was subsequ seal at 0015 on 23 septemb china success deton it first tunnel nuclear test the tunnel self seal mechan work and there were no blow the top or jump the gun incid the yield of the nuclear explos was basic in agreement with the design to understand the characterist of tunnel nuclear test and to verifi the agreement between the theoret design and the actual explos the tunnel and explos chamber were excav from 1970 to 1971 the height and the size of the chimney caus by the explos were measur and the effect of the self seal and fill function were investig three core were drill to collect the radioact materi generat by the explos first hand data of these investig show that the self seal technolog and the specimen core technolog were success the theoret understand of the fluid mechan of an underground nuclear explos was basic in agreement with realiti diagnost measur made near the nuclear bomb yield import data and point to new direct in the develop of near field physic measur through this test understand of underground nuclear test was valid and enhanc and major interfer problem were reveal in the near field physic measur becaus the test was conduct in limeston it generat a great amount of carbon monoxid and carbon dioxid which were detriment to the safeti of radiat chemistri analysi it was not desir to conduct underground nuclear test in limeston the nuclear test base therefor move the test site to the granit beishan north mountain underground test site to gain more experi in underground nuclear test to improv the weapon design and to test new nuclear principl five more test were conduct from 1975 to the end of 1988 at the nanshan and beishan test site in the second tunnel nuclear test on 27 decemb 1975 import data were obtain in the near field physic diagnost measur these data help solv the technic problem in tunnel self seal rapid sampl acquisit and electromagnet interfer in near field physic measur in the third tunnel nuclear test on 17 octob 1976 new advanc were made in rapid sampl acquisit and new understand were gain in nuclear explos in granit and anti interfer technolog in the fourth nuclear tunnel test on 4 may 1983 rapid sampl core was achiev for the first time abund high qualiti solid sampl of radioact materi for chemic analysi were obtain in the first drill meanwhil major advanc were made in near field physic measur technolog on 19 decemb 1984 the fifth nuclear tunnel test was conduct the test was made for a new principl in nuclear weapon and the experi was a success china had made a major breakthrough in new nuclear weapon technolog 2 shaft nuclear test in a shaft test the nuclear devic and various sensor are lower to the bottom of a larg diamet well the well is then fill and the nuclear devic deton due to the depth limit of a tunnel test most mountain cannot satisfi the experiment requir this is particular true for high power explos in a shaft test there is usual no limit to explos power as long as the underground rock are suitabl for test a shaft can be drill to the depth need for the particular explos power for this reason the shaft test mode has becom the princip method for underground nuclear test in april 1967 china chose the xingeer region northwest of lop nur for the shaft test site after year of effort a complet experiment facil and live quarter were establish and various equip develop the necessari condit for conduct the test were basic provid a shaft nuclear test requir a well with a larg diamet and a certain depth drill such a shaft requir a larg drill rig in octob 1966 the nuclear test base the nuclear weapon institut and engin depart survey coal mine oil field and machineri depart and submit a propos to the defens scienc commiss to develop a larg diamet hard rock drill machin on 9 may the central special committe approv the propos and decid that the drill task should be the respons of the ministri of coal industri later the defens scienc commiss took charg and the machin task should be given to the first ministri of machin build other particip unit includ the nuclear test base the coal institut the lanzhou petrochem plant the luoyang institut of mine machineri the shanghai institut of coal mine machineri and the beij institut of mine in octob 1967 work began on design plan in 1971 the drill machin was assembl at the lanzhou petrochem plant and move to the nuclear test base the develop of the larg drill machin was the key to shaft test of nuclear weapon in 1973 the drill began at the test base by april 1975 the first granit shaft 300 meter deep and 25 meter in diamet was drill later sever other shaft were drill and drill techniqu gradual improv in april 1975 the nuclear test base submit the propos for the underground shaft nuclear test to the defens scienc commiss extens discuss and deliber were then made by the nuclear test base the nuclear weapon design institut and the engin design institut of the defens scienc commiss in march and april 1977 the defens scienc commiss review the general plan for conduct the first underground shaft nuclear test and coordin the technic task of engin test and nuclear devic a 200 meter deep granit shaft was chosen for the test the main goal of the test was to learn the skill for shaft test and to gain experi in adopt engin techniqu test safeti and nuclear devic test techniqu to the underground shaft environ the engin design and the design of nonstandard equip were assum by the engin design institut of the defens scienc commiss the nuclear weapon institut was respons for the design and develop of the enclosur for the nuclear devic and the seal of the explos chamber the construct of the shaft began in april 1977 sinc the flood rate of the shaft was 93 ton per hour the seal of the nuclear devic and test safeti were jeopard to counter this problem the flood was reduc by seal and reinforc the shaft wall the daqe oil field on more than one occas sent peopl to the test site to advis the pump of water the technolog team of the test base seal the water by spray grout and by grout inject after 15 month of tireless work the shaft construct was complet the flood rate was reduc to 25 ton per hour basic satisfi the test requir in juli 1978 hoist and instal began to be fail safe a test hoist was done first after gain some experi in hoist the offici hoist was done in late septemb when the offici hoist was perform the nuclear devic was place in a special seal contain measur probe and the seal nuclear devic were then place in a special seal explos chamber tube were use to connect the contain the probe and the cabl into an integr whole which was slowli lower to the bottom of the shaft the hoist of the assembl was tricki and it procedur need rigor control the instal personnel of the test base adher to a posit respons system and safe lower the devic to the bottom of the shaft the shaft tube back fill began on 2 octob back fill was perform while the water was be pump after 12 day of hard work 1 400 cubic meter of space was back fill and the qualiti was complet in keep with requir the difficult task of construct and fill the shaft was done by the 1st compani 6th battalion of the technolog team of the nuclear test base this courag compani was award the titl of new long march commando by the central committe of the chines communist youth leagu to ensur a safe and success test the work to elimin error and dud was firm grasp the nuclear weapon design institut repeat inspect the deton system and the oper procedur static electr test were perform for the deton cabl and lightn strike prevent was implement after the nuclear devic was lower to the bottom of the shaft the water level and the temperatur and humid in the seal contain were monitor day and night extens safeti measur were made for the test cabl and the deton cabl emerg reaction plan were also formul at 9 oclock on 14 octob 1978 china success conduct it first shaft nuclear explos the test achiev total closur three hour after the explos radioact gas sampl were obtain on the 16th day radioact solid sampl were acquir satisfactori result were obtain in safeti engin measur and sampl start in 1981 china move it atmospher nuclear test underground to advanc new principl of nuclear weapon and to improv test technolog four more shaft test were conduct by 1988 in the second and third test the water level was low the contain size was small and grout seal and submerg pump were done manual more item were test than the first test the third test use an inclin shaft with a maximum tilt of 61 percent the two previous test use 2 percent or so the lower of the explos chamber was done with the aid of steel pipe experi was gain in tilt shaft construct and in lower the shaft for the fourth test was construct use steel sleev pipe and the dri shaft method a measur frame was use for the first time through this test the design and construct of a dri shaft use the telescop tube method were master experi was gain on near field measur and electromagnet interfer prevent and new breakthrough were made in measur technolog becaus of the high groundwat level flood was more sever use a shallow water test mode the construct was difficult the construct time was long the cost was high and it was unsaf for the worker to work in the shaft to find a better and more econom method on 5 june 1987 china test a nuclear devic of greater explos power use a medium shaft depth and an all water level mode meanwhil experi was gain in measur anti interfer cabl seal for high pressur and shaft back fill this signifi china new develop in shaft test technolog the main issu in ensur safeti in underground nuclear test is to prevent radioact materi from emerg from the ground in china five shaft test the back fill and seal of the shaft ensur safeti experi had been gain in theoret calcul engin design and construct techniqu china shaft nuclear test cover the rang of water level and well depth pronounc improv have been made in the develop of larg scale equip and in engin design drill shaft construct hoist back fill and sampl drill in term of measur techniqu china went from a small contain to a larg contain test scaffold multipl tube and near field physic measur in near field physic measur and radiochemistri measur theoret and practic were investig to a greater depth and weapon physic was studi for weapon design this show that china underground nuclear test capabl have improv great china is further develop it underground nuclear test investig new measur techniqu and improv current equip from 1964 to 1989 china conduct a total of 34 nuclear test of which 23 test were in the atmospher and 11 were underground compar to the 800 nuclear test in the unit state and the 600 test by the former soviet union china number of nuclear test was quit small sinc a nuclear test is a scientif activ it natur has a dual possibl even though three of china test did not succeed the success rate and effici are still quit high by follow zhou enlai polici of serious detail stabl and reliabl china has achiev a great deal in research and nuclear weapon develop the result provid import inform on the use and

attack they also possess the second strike advantag that land base strateg weapon do not have china decid to develop nuclear submarin in 1958 by 1988 china had develop the nuclear torpedo submarin and nuclear power missil submarin nuclear submarin are a major breakthrough in china ship build technolog section 1 nuclear submarin 1 develop in two step in 1958 short after the central committe approv the develop of the nuclear submarin the navi build and mainten depart form a nuclear submarin group to studi the general design of a nuclear submarin in 1959 the navi propos the concept of an overal plan for nuclear submarin due to temporari econom hardship and lack of research resourc the central special committe approv a plan in march 1963 to concentr resourc on key issu in nuclear power and submarin hull in the mid 1960s the nation economi improv and china succeed in copi and independ develop the convent submarin a preliminari design of the nuclear devic was complet and progress was made on major compon and materi of the nuclear reactor on 20 march 1965 the central special committe approv the resumpt of the nuclear submarin project at this time director yu xiaohong 0060 4562 5725 of the seventh academi in the sixth ministri of machin build and expert huang xuhua recommend that the nuclear submarin develop project be done in two stage the first stage was to be the develop of a nuclear torpedo submarin and the second stage was to be the develop of a guid missil submarin the reason was that the technolog for the submarin to land guid missil and other weapon system was extrem complex in addit there was also the need for mani technic problem for the nuclear submarin itself and for key compon for the guid missil these problem were veri difficult and requir a longer time to solv by first develop a nuclear torpedo submarin china could not onli solv the technic difficulti step and step but also make use of some of the same materi and equip to speed up the process the sixth ministri support the recommend and made a report to the central special committe in juli 1965 the plan was approv 2 nuclear power torpedo submarin while approv the abov recommend the central special committe also demand breakthrough in nuclear power and it associ instal technolog it set a date of 1972 for underwat test of the nuclear submarin to this end laboratori 719 was establish in the seventh academi to work on the design of the nuclear submarin the new laboratori was head by xia tong 1115 2717 and was base on the capabl of laboratori 701 and 715 the leader of the new laboratori togeth with it technic staff huang xuhua and you zipe 1429 1311 1627 organ a studi while the group was be staf and propos a preliminari plan for the overal design and major equip of the submarin the

regener and purif system underwat navig and posit system long distanc secur communic system underwat long distanc warn search surveil communic and target posit sonar system final there must also be an anti submarin torpedo weapon system compat with the combat mission of the ship the equip system chosen had a direct impact on the fight abil of the submarin the develop time and cost and the success or failur of the project they were the first major issu to be address in the discuss of the overal propos differ understand and opinion were air in the discuss some were concern that with both convent and nuclear power the develop of too much new equip for the first nuclear power submarin could prevent the project from achiev a time complet other believ that advanc equip under develop and to be develop should be employ in china first nuclear submarin in order to catch up and overtak the world standard to unifi the various view the overal plan was analyz specif by the particip depart differ view were unifi on the basi of two principl approv by the central special committe these principl were first to develop the nuclear submarin base on practic and domest avail technolog and second china first nuclear submarin should have the charact of an experiment vessel but at the same time possess the major tactic and technic capabl of a warship it was decid that in addit to the nuclear powerpl the submarin should have the follow new system in order to ensur combat capabl these were the anti submarin torpedo and the associ command control launch and inerti guidanc system high power transient transmitt comprehens sonar system and an integr air condit system other system should employ mass produc domest conventionalsubmarin equip wherev possibl to meet the need of submarin develop the seventh academi a primari organ for the project start a seri of new specialti and organ a number of research laboratori after sever year of concentr hard work there were breakthrough in seven key technolog and the anticip goal were basic realiz decis on bodi profil china first nuclear submarin adopt the teardrop profil for high speed underwat cruis it was a new technolog at a time when china did not have complet facil for fluid dynam test worker of laboratori 719 broad survey domest and foreign data and conduct theoret analysi and investig to select the optim plan and paramet they also conduct extens experiment test with laboratori 702 and other unit to studi the basic rule for control a teardrop shape vessel experiment verif was conduct for the chosen design in wind tunnel rotat arm water tank and wave resist water tank laboratori 719 also built a special experiment turntabl for studi the submarin control and for simul the control function actual navig test show that the teardrop profil had superior maneuver and achiev an underwat speed greater than that of the convent profil china had achiev a big success in develop the fluid dynam properti of the nuclear submarin design of a larg diamet pressur resist hull the teardrop profil was stubbi and had a low aspect ratio it also increas the water displac the diamet of the pressur resist hull was about twice that of a convent submarin part of the structur was base on a conic shell design convent design code and comput method prove inadequ the safeti and reliabl of the pressur resist submarin had a life and death import scientist engag in structur research appli short shell plastic stabil theori and explor new method of comput they also investig differ part of the structur with scale model and conduct simul strength test for the weld of the pressur resist method these test show that the hull design met deep dive requir develop of integr air condit system the air condit system is crucial to the well be of the crew and normal oper of the various mechan electr and electron equip in collabor with other plant and laboratori laboratori 718 of the seventh academi develop an oxygen generat devic a c0 sub 2 remov devic a hazard gas burn devic various purif filter and cabin air condit analysi monitor work with chongq general machineri plant they have also develop larg capac refriger for submarin use these system underw on land simul test enclos perform reliabl test and crew endur test in a simul submarin environ creat by the navi medic research institut satisfactori result were obtain in all test with

difficulti were overcom in the develop of the electr dual plane the acoust anti submarin torpedo the deep ocean torpedo launch devic and the digit torpedo fire command after persist research the develop of the inerti guidanc system also reach the goal set in the plan the develop of a nuclear submarin was a complic system engin project there were more than 2 600 meter and instrument on the submarin 46 000 part 90 kilomet of cabl and 30 kilomet of pipe equip densiti was veri high the hull design for the nuclear submarin had to allow a sensibl layout of the complic system in order to satisfi the combat requir the design also had to ensur sound work and live condit for the crew to solv this difficult problem laboratori 719 work close with the nuclear submarin manufactur plant and built a full size plastic model by spend more than a year of time the design instal crew and navi personnel conduct simul instal and oper they discov and solv numer problem in instal and mainten after repeat adjust and modif they final the layout of the equip and meter the path of pipe and cabl and the locat of more than 1 000 open in the pressur resist hull these activ ensur that the general design was success in the first attempt construct began in 1968 in order to stay on schedul as approv by the central special committe laboratori 719 organ two design meet and complet more than 700 design draw in a short period of time half of the scientist and technic staff pitch in to help with the construct the submarin plant divid the work into two task submarin hull construct and equip instal under difficult work and live condit the technic staff worker and cadr all join in to improv the technolog and equip and made the schedul launch possibl test on the nuclear submarin began in april 1971 electr power was generat on the nuclear reactor in juli and preliminari evalu was made for the main machineri and the power train on 15 august china first nuclear submarin sail toward the test zone for the first time by april 1972 the submarin had undergon more than 20 test run and log sever thousand nautic mile most of the test were complet from januari to april 1974 the submarin made inspect test run it was deliv to the chines navi on 1 august 3 nuclear power missil submarin research and develop of china nuclear power missil submarin began short after some result were obtain in the develop of the anti submarin nuclear torpedo submarin in june 1967 the navi propos that the develop of the nuclear power missil submarin should be a two phase process the first phase was to develop a nuclear power missil submarin on the basi of the nuclear torpedo submarin but the perform requir should not be set too high the second phase should be build a better submarin base on the first one the propos was evalu and discuss a decis was made that the emphasi for the first guid missil submarin be place on the submarin to land guid missil weapon system and the technolog for underwat launch of the guid missil most of the system on the torpedo submarin were retain with the except of the guid missil weapon system and some item that had to be redesign becaus of the increas water displac crew size and safeti requir the main differ between the two type of submarin was the guid missil modul the missil modul contain a number of launch tube and their associ power system underwat hatch open and pressur equal system air condit and temperatur control system water inject system and equip for missil inspect aim and launch control equip requir develop and improv repres about 15 percent of the total the key technolog for the guid missil submarin were the underwat launch of the submarin to land guid missil and the precis navig and posit of the submarin underwat launch of the missil requir that the missil be launch from a depth of sever ten of meter and that the missil have adequ muzzl veloc the missil had to maintain a normal stabl attitud as it emerg from the water and this had to be achiev in the presenc of wave current and fluctuat of the submarin the degre of difficulti was therefor much greater than a surfac launch for this reason the develop plan requir test on a land base launch pad and launch tube befor the underwat launch test on a submarin laboratori 713 of the seventh academi assum the duti of research and design for the launch devic led by wei naiwen 7614 0035 2429 test were perform and a combust power cold launch plan was adopt in octob 1972 an underwat launch test was conduct use a full scale model missil on a modifi convent guid missil submarin the intend goal was achiev and the key technolog of underwat launch was attain the nuclear power missil submarin requir a high accur navig and posit system it not onli had to ensur safe underwat navig of the submarin but also determin the posit accur so that the missil could accur hit the target laboratori 707 work extens on this technolog their hard work final result in the inerti guidanc system and the star and satellit guidanc system for china first nuclear power missil submarin in septemb 1970 construct began on the nuclear power missil submarin in septemb 1979 the defens scienc commiss and the offic for defens industri name peng shilu as the chief design for the nuclear submarin and huang weilu zhao renkai and huang xuhua as deputi chief design overal supervis

was imposs to fire accur later in a simul fire test after adopt a scheme propos by zhu xibin 2612 6932 2430 of the system engin depart of china shipbuild industri corpor the accuraci was signific improv satisfactori result were obtain in a drone fire test the design final test was success complet in decemb of the same year all tactic specif have met design requir dure the same period the design final test was complet on land and at sea for a similar twin 30mm ship gun weapon system the test of the twin 37mm ship gun weapon system ii that is use to shoot down anti ship missil was test at the liaoxi ship gun test rang in octob 1987 in this test in addit to complet various technic prepar work an ultralow target with a reflect area of 01 meter squar and a low altitud tow target were deploy a digit automat record was develop and an experiment scheme to suppress the dynam accuraci of a small area ultralow altitud target to allow the test to proceed smooth on this basi the power resolut reaction time and dynam tack accuraci of the twin 37mm ship gun ii with refer to low altitud and ultralow altitud target were investig it was found that this ship gun system could detect and track target in time it accuraci against low altitud tow target was excel 2 test of twin 100mm ship gun weapon system design final test for the twin 100mm ship gun weapon system was conduct in two stage on land and at sea the stage done on land was primarili focus on it dynam accuraci and the sea phase was to evalu it fire accuraci it reliabl and tactic perform were test throughout the entir process in may 1982 the twin 100mm ship gun was test on land at the liaoxi ship gun test rang this includ dynam accuraci test with refer to constant speed target travel straight on the sea target fli horizont at constant speed and dive target the test result on target at sea show that this ship gun system is reliabl stabl and accur enough to meet all specif in 1983 the twin 100mm ship gun was equip with the first medium calib automat shell suppli system independ develop by china after go through anchor test static and dynam problem solv at high speed and function drill at sea the servic behavior of the twin 100mm ship gun was further evalu under intens longitudin and transvers roll in addit it also underw fire accuraci test use fix surfac target tow target and remot control drone the twin 100mm ship gun weapon system pass two stage of rigor test includ close to 200 dynam accuraci test and fire near 1 000 round in the gunneri test it was prove to meet all design specif it is stabl reliabl accur and could work automat around the clock in all weather condit from 1972 through 1987 the liaoxi ship gun test rang organ test on 6 differ ship gun in 3 differ calib 7 model of radar of 2 differ type 7 model of control panel of 3 differ kind and 5 model of ship gun weapon system in 3 differ calib in addit on the basi of it experi they also prepar the test procedur for the design final of ship gun weapon system test procedur for the design final of track radar test procedur for the design final of ship gun fire control panel and test procedur for the design final of ship gun weapon system on the sea 3 test of twin 130mm ship gun weapon system in 1971 the digit control twin 130mm ship gun weapon system develop by the 368 plant need to be test the liaoxi ship gun test rang had just been construct the plant creat a test team by pull technic talent from differ organ they were train at baicheng convent weapon test rang while they prepar for this task in the fall of 1972 the twin 130mm ship gun system was test for the first time at the liaoxi ship gun test rang due to lack of experi it was direct instal on a ship to conduct test at sea without go through ani land test consequ major technic problem such as lack of coordin were encount the test was termin a review of this experi led us to understand and follow the procedur that land test must be conduct befor ani test can be conduct at sea in 1973 the liaoxi ship gun test rang began to test the twin 130mm ship gun system on land to verifi the feasibl coordin and stabil of the system and to evalu the dynam accuraci of the system use the sea surfac as a background the land accuraci test had to be conduct use model sea combat condit ultralow altitud target were use to simul anti ship missil these were the difficulti of the test in particular it was necessari to determin accur ani deviat from everi theoret factor after numer attempt yang banglin 2799 2831 2651 at the test rang wrote a program entitl solut to theoret valu of various fire factor to solv this problem in 1973 the test of individu unit of radar control panel and ship gun began in 1975 design final test of the entir system was conduct through dynam accuraci test use ship and aircraft as target and target practic use fix surfac target and tow target the perform of the twin 130mm ship gun weapon system was evalu the test result show that the system work smooth with excel accuraci the plan was feasibl but not veri reliabl in octob 1980 the twin 130mm ship gun system was test at sea at the liaoxi ship gun test rang the focal point and difficulti was it fire accuraci test base on the experi acquir in gunneri test on water an aerial camera was use to measur the actual distanc between the water splash and the bull eye to obtain the relev paramet to calcul the rang and bear deviat thus the key technic issu with regard to the accuraci test at sea was resolv after it was qualifi for track accuraci it fire accuraci was test use fix and tow target final a remot control target ship was use to test it firepow in real combat situat while it was found that the system was high accur it was still not veri reliabl after the system were modifi to a multi processor distribut function ship gun system use brand new high reliabl compon and technolog by the 713rd institut and the 368th plant it was test in zhoushan in 1986 after a number of target practic test use fix and tow target the capabl of this ship gun system was substanti enhanc it was more reliabl and accur section 5 test of navig equip there is a varieti of navig equip furthermor it need to be test under dynam condit in the ocean which make it test more difficult the navig equip test laboratori of the naval test base in collabor with the appropri institut and factori develop a varieti of dynam bear and level measur instrument and high precis inerti navig equip for ship use it import a high accur ship locat measur devic that solv the problem associ with
