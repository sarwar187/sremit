is still difficult to maintain for reason that are poor understood the fear that diet ultim fail becaus the dieter metabol becom abnorm sluggish appear to be unfound research report in today journal of the american medic assn but they said long term weight loss is still veri difficult to maintain for reason that are poor understood the find are similar to those report recent by a usc research expert previous assum that a drop in weight trigger a perman correspond drop in rest metabol rate the amount of energi the bodi requir at rest to maintain basic physiolog function such as heart rate and respir a perman lower rest metabol rate would mean that a dieter would not burn calori as rapid and might regain weight or have troubl shed more pound howev the new studi at the univers of pennsylvania show that when overweight women who also exercis were taken off a veri low calori diet their metabol bounc back to a level that is normal for their new lower bodi weight the find are import for individu attempt medic supervis diet some expert fear that veri low calori diet such as liquid diet put the bodi into a starvat mode slow metabol to a rate that thwart signific weight loss theoret at least diet can work but research still dont understand whi it is so hard for mani peopl to perman keep the weight off said thoma a wadden associ professor of psycholog at the univers of pennsylvania school of medicin statist tell us that it is extrem difficult to keep weight off peopl will still have to work veri hard at this despit our favor metabol find wadden said studi have shown that extrem diet trigger a plung in metabol rate but how the chang in metabol rate affect long term weight control has been the subject of much research and debat we have long known that when peopl diet metabol rate fall sharpli and the more you cut back your calori the more your metabol rate fall wadden said but doe it ever come back up or doe it stay down that is what we were tri to assess the studi follow 18 women weigh an averag of 216 pound for 48 week nine of the women receiv a convent diet of 1 200 calori a day for 48 week the other nine were place on the veri low calori liquid formula diet optifast for 16 week follow by a convent reduc diet all the women increas their physic activ by walk after five week the rest metabol rate drop in both group most signific in the veri low calori dieter but metabol rate rose again in both group after 48 week metabol rate of both group were about 9 lower than at the start of the studi and weight had been reduc by 16 to 19 after peopl lost 40 or 50 pound their metabol rate is lower than it was befor that reduct in metabol rate has to be anticip it take less fuel to keep a lighter bodi go than a heavier bodi wadden said what they dont have is a long term suppress of the metabol rate due to the effect of diet over the long term the metabol rate increas to a level that is appropri for your new reduc bodi weight the result mirror a similar studi perform at usc by dr ken fujioka now a san diego base research in a studi of obes women place on a 650 calori diet for 10 week fujioka found that the dieter metabol rate fell in proport to their weight loss wadden find that even diet of 420 calori do not trigger long term metabol suppress is signific fujioka said the question was how mani calori can you go down and not perman lower metabol rate im surpris at that number 420 calori he said becaus the metabol rate was lower than befor diet howev the dieter still need to consum fewer calori to maintain their weight loss wadden said general for each 25 pound lost a dieter should cut back 100 calori a day wadden also note that the women in the studi also exercis a factor that might be veri import in boost metabol rate it import to exercis while your diet he said the exercis preserv your muscl tissu and the more muscl tissu you have the higher your metabol rate moreov we know that exercis is the singl known predictor of long term weight loss in a relat studi publish earlier this year stanford research found that men who diet but did not exercis experienc a suppress metabol rate but overweight men who lost weight through exercis but did not diet experienc no reduct in metabol rate weve alway held that it would be better for overweight peopl to increas exercis than to reli total on extrem low calori diet said peter wood of stanford exercis is less like to have this perman effect on the rest metabol rate which make it easier for peopl to maintain their weight in the futur but wadden said research have few other clue on

outlin of soft tissu like tumor which are beyond the reach of x ray and could be studi until now onli by biopsi or the inject of radioisotop the idea of magnet creat imag was first propos in the unit

develop of the new technolog was left to the british in 1973 a group in aberdeen scotland an offshoot of a pioneer team at the univers of nottingham obtain the first whole bodi imag of a live creatur use magnet reson it was a cross section of a mous but the british mous didnt roar for long leadership in the field quick pass back to the unit state we british seem to have a gift for let technolog slip out of our grasp say ross who is himself join the brain drain of worker in the field when he came to huntington last year to direct it spectroscopi unit each of the major group in the state has been head at one time or anoth by an englishman ross say under the leadership of rosss american colleagu dr william g bradley huntington imag unit had alreadi becom the busiest in the world sinc it began oper in 1983 it has perform more than 18 000 mri scan but it is mrs that ross and his colleagu in the unit state and abroad believ may hold even greater promis though it has actual been around longer than mri mrs is far less familiar and is in it experiment infanc it doesnt produc imag just squiggl say ross but to know eye like his they are as meaning as ani pictur rosss squiggl are the spectra or fingerprint if you will of the bodi chemic jog by radio wave in the presenc of the magnet power field each of the target compound respond in a uniqu characterist way transmit it own jag spike signatur to the monitor unfortun say ross that the sort of thing even train mds arent alway comfort with they are use to and prefer look at imag it remind them of the biochemistri cours that they came to hate in colleg or medic school part for this psycholog reason but also becaus it requir more power magnet mrs has been much slower to catch on than it younger sibl mri but ross and other predict that situat will chang when it doe they say the diagnosi and treatment of certain cancer and other diseas will be signific advanc mrs is avail onli at a few place such as the diason plant the veteran administr medic center in san francisco and duke univers on an experiment basi to select patient like rosss m huntington is instal a power new magnet capabl of produc a field of 15 tesla about 30 000 time the strength of the earth magnet field that will be share by both bradley imag team and rosss spectroscopist but if ross and his colleagu have their way it will soon move out of the

bradley sum up the situat were still in the stone age when it come to treat cancer the metabol of cancer cell fluctuat from day to day yet we dose patient with drug and radiat without ani idea of what stage the cell are in at the particular moment of treatment that could soon chang becaus mrs can detect shift in cellular metabol almost as soon as they occur in a recent experi on himself dr jame w

that cancer cell are most recept to chemotherapi and almost immedi after the anti cancer drug are administ mrs could be use to monitor their effect against the target cell no longer would doctor have to wait week or month to look for shrinkag or growth of a tumor in fact it was in quest of just such an assess that ross flew to san francisco with his cancer ridden patient the examin let us detect a number of thing that tell us someth about the reaction of the tumor cell to the treatment he explain we can for exampl detect the presenc or absenc of atp we can also pick up other metabolit as well as inorgan phosphat and even ph or cellular acid the relat amount detect as measur by the size of the squiggl on the monitor of his machin are a precis indic of whether a cluster of cancer cell is grow or be held in check the key say ross is phosphocreatin becaus if it level return to normal you know that the patient is most probabl respond to the treatment phosphocreatin is a sensit indic of a deplet energi state success treatment is also like to be signal by a rise in the level of inorgan phosphat sinc this is a breakdown product of die cell the biochem intricaci of such measur do not faze

februari 1993 have been consid inform from the survey carri out by the centr for medicin research on current practic and strategi use by the pharmaceut industri for genotox test purv et al 1994 has also been consid a the base set of strain use in bacteri mutat assay current guidelin for the detect of bacteri mutagen call for the inclus of sever strain to detect base substitut and frameshift point mutat the salmonella typhimurium strain cite in guidelin normal ta1535 ta1537 ta98 and ta100 will detect such chang at g c site within target histidin gene it is clear from the literatur that some mutagen carcinogen attack a t base pair preferenti eg levin 1982 wilcox et al 1990 also see note 1 therefor the standard set of strain use in bacteri mutat assay should includ strain that will detect point mutat at a t site such as s typhimurium ta102 which possess a mutat at an a t site within multipl copi of hisg gene or e coli wp2 uvra which possess an a t mutat site in the trpe gene or the same strain carri the plasmid pkm101 which carri mucab gene that enhanc error prone repair in conclus the follow base set of bacteri strain should be use for routin test the strain cite below are all s typhimurium isol unless specifi otherwis 1 ta98 2 ta100 3 ta1535 4 ta1537 or ta97 or ta97a see note 2 5 ta102 or e coli wp2 uvra or e coli wp2 uvra pkm101 b accept bone marrow test for the detect of clastogen in vivo test measur chromosom aberr in nucleat bone marrow cell in rodent can detect a wide spectrum of chang in chromosom integr these chang almost all result from breakag of one or more chromatid as the initi event breakag of chromatid can result in micronucleus format if an acentr fragment is produc therefor assay detect either chromosom aberr or micronuclei are accept for detect clastogen see note 3 micronuclei can also result from disloc of chromosom from the mitot spindl and thus micronucleus test have the potenti to detect aneugen compound in conclus the analysi of either chromosom aberr or micronuclei in bone marrow cell in vivo is accept for the detect of clastogen the accept of the peripher blood micronucleus assay as a substitut for the bone marrow micronucleus assay is be activ consid see note 4 c guidanc on the further evalu of compound give in vitro posit result compar trial have shown conclus that each in vitro test system generat both fals negat and fals posit result in relat to predict rodent carcinogen the test batteri approach is design to reduc the risk of fals negat result howev the genotox test batteri as describ will onli detect carcinogen that act primarili via a mechan involv direct genet damag such as the major of known human carcinogen accord to the result of the nation toxicolog program haseman et al 1990 and an analysi of result from test of pharmaceut and industri chemic in japan shimada 1993 approxim 15 percent of carcinogen are not detect by the common use batteri of genotox test therefor a posit result in ani assay for genotox doe not necessarili mean that the test compound pose a genotox hazard to man the follow point should be consid when assess in vitro posit result in vitro posit result that are without appar biolog relev should be exclud these includ the follow consider this list is not exhaust but is given as an aid to decisionmak i is the respons clear reproduc ii is the magnitud of the respons regard as biolog signific iii for posit respons in the presenc of a compet metabol system is in vitro metabol similar to in vivo metabol are in vitro specif metabolit induc iv can the effect be attribut to extrem cultur condit that do not occur in in vivo situat ie extrem of ph osmol etc v is the effect onli seen at extrem low surviv level vi are compound in this chemic class normal associ with posit effect in vitro are compound in this chemic class normal associ with negat effect in vivo in vivo a posit result in an in vitro test that is regard as biolog relev see previous paragraph indic that the test compound has genotox potenti an in vitro test measur the same genet endpoint should be carri out for confirm such in vitro test usual carri more signific than the compar in vitro assay ashbi 1983 thus for a compound show clastogen activ in vitro the bone marrow micronucleus or chromosom aberr assay can fulfil this role it is recogn that at present there is no valid wide use in vivo system which measur gene mutat howev in vivo gene mutat assay use endogen gene or transgen in the rat and mous are at various stage of develop and valid until these test for mutat becom accept result from other wide use in vivo test for genotox in tissu other than the bone marrow can provid valuabl addit data flexibl is desir in the choic of a second in vivo assay see note 5 in conclus where posit result have been obtain in one or more of the establish in vitro test analysi should take place on a case by case basi as describ abov and in note 5 d valid of negat in vivo test result becaus in vivo test have a pivot role in genotox test batteri it is necessari to prove adequ exposur of the target tissu this can be achiev by a clear biolog respons in the tissu in question or by toxicokinet data if adequ exposur cannot be achiev eg with compound show veri poor bioavail extens protein bind etc convent in vivo genotox test may have littl valu the follow recommend appli to bone marrow cytogenet assay if other target tissu are use similar principl should be appli for compound show posit result in ani of the in vitro test employ valid of in vivo exposur should be made by ani of the follow measur i by measur a signific chang in the proport of immatur erythrocyt among total erythrocyt in the bone marrow at the dose and sampl time use in the micronucleus test or by measur a signific reduct in mitot index for the chromosom aberr assay ii evid of bioavail of drug relat materi either by measur blood or plasma level see note 6 iii by direct measur of drug relat materi in bone marrow iv by autoradiograph assess of tissu exposur for method ii to iv assess should be made preferenti at the top dose use the same speci strain and dose rout use in the bone marrow assay if in vitro test do not show genotox potenti valid of in vivo system exposur is also need and can be achiev by ani of the method abov but can also be infer from the result of standard absorpt distribut metabol and excret adm studi in rodent e definit of the top concentr for in vitro test i high dose for nontox compound for freeli solubl nontox compound the upper treatment level are 5 mg plate for bacteria and 5 mg ml or 10 mm for mammalian cell ii desir level of cytotox most genotox carcinogen are not detect in in vitro mammalian cell genotox assay unless the concentr test induc some degre of cytotox it is also appar that at veri low surviv level mechan other than direct genotox per se can lead to posit result that are relat to cytotox and not genotox eg event associ with apoptosi endonucleas releas from lysosom etc kirkland 1992 such event are like to occur onc a certain concentr threshold is reach for a toxic compound to balanc these conflict consider the follow level of cytotox are current accept for in vitro mammalian cell test the desir level of toxic for in vitro cytogenet test use cell line is defin as greater than 50 percent inhibit of cell prolifer or cultur confluenc for lymphocyt cultur an inhibit of mitot index by greater than 50 percent is consid suffici the desir upper limit of toxic for mammalian cell mutat test should be at least 80 percent of the correspond control valu toxic can be measur either by assess of clone effici immedi after treatment suspens growth immedi after treatment or by calcul of relat total growth iii test of poor solubl compound there is some evid that dose relat genotox activ can be detect when test particular compound in the insolubl rang this is alway associ with dose relat toxic see note 7 it is possibl that solubil of a precipit is enhanc by serum in the cultur medium or in the presenc of s9 mix constitu it is also probabl that cell membran lipid can facilit absorpt of lipophil compound into cell in addit some type of mammalian cell are phagocyt eg chines hamster v79 cho and chl cell and can ingest solid particl which may subsequ dispers into the cytoplasm an insolubl compound may also contain solubl genotox impur it should also be note that some insolubl compound are administ in vivo as suspens or as particul materi heavi precipit can interfer with score the desir paramet and render control of exposur veri difficult eg where a centrifug step s is includ in a protocol to remov cell from exposur media see note 8 or render the test compound unavail to enter cell and interact with dna the follow strategi is recommend for test relat insolubl compound the recommend refer to the test articl in the cultur medium if no toxic is observ the lowest precipit concentr should be use as the top concentr if dose relat toxic or mutagen is note irrespect of solubl then the top concentr should be base on toxic as describ abov it is recogn that the desir level of cytotox may not be achiev if the extent of precipit interfer with the score of the test in all case precipit should be evalu use the nake eye f use of male femal rodent in bone marrow micronucleus test extens studi of the activ of known clastogen in the mous bone marrow micronucleus test have shown that in general male mice are more sensit than femal mice for micronucleus induct see note 9 quantit differ in sensit to micronucleus induct have been identifi between the sex but no qualit differ have been describ where mark quantit differ exist there is invari a differ in toxic between the sex if there is a clear qualit differ in metabolit between male and femal rodent then both sex should be use in the micronucleus test similar principl can be appli for other establish in vivo test see note 10 both rat and mice are deem accept for use in the bone marrow mironucleus test see note 11 in summari unless there are obvious differ in toxic or metabol between male and femal rodent male alon are suffici for use in bone marrow micronucleus test if gender specif drug are to be test the appropri sex should be use note 1 analysi of the databas held by the japanes ministri of labour on 5 526 compound and support by smaller databas held by various pharmaceut compani has shown that approxim 75 percent of the bacteri mutagen identifi are detect by e coli wp2 uvra but not by the standard set of four salmonella strain although anim carcinogen data are not avail on these compound it is like that such compound would carri the same carcinogen potenti as mutagen induc chang in the standard set of salmonella strain 2 ta1537 ta97 and ta97a contain cytosin run at the mutat sensit site within the relev target histidin loci and show similar sensit to frameshift mutagen that induc delet of base in these frameshift hotspot there was consensus agreement at the intern workshop on standard of genotox procedur melbourn 1993 gatehous et al 1994 that all three strain could be use interchang and that decis is endors here 3 as the mechan of micronucleus format are relat to those induc chromosom aberr eg hayashi et al 1984 both micronuclei and chromosom aberr can be accept as assay system to screen for clastogen induc by test compound comparison of data where both the mous micronucleus test and rat bone marrow metaphas analysi have been carri out on the same compound has shown impress correl both qualit ie detect clastogen and quantit eg determin of the lowest clastogen dose even closer correl can be expect where the data are generat in the same speci 4 the peripher blood micronucleus test in the mous use acridin orang supravit stain was introduc by hayashi et al 1990 the test has recent been the subject of a major collabor studi by the japanes collabor studi group for the micronucleus test see mutat research 1992 278 nos 2 3 the test were carri out in cd 1 mice use 23 test substanc of various mode of action peripher blood sampl from the same anim was examin 0 24 48 and 72 hour or longer after treatment as a rule one chemic was studi by 2 differ laboratori 46 laboratori took part all chemic were detect as induc of micronuclei there were quantit differ between laboratori but no qualit differ most chemic gave the greatest respons 48 hour after treatment thus the result suggest that the peripher blood assay use acridin orang supravit stain can generat reproduc and reliabl data to evalu the clastogen of chemic base on these data the melbourn workshop conclud that this assay is equival in accuraci to the bone marrow micronucleus assay 5 apart from the cytogenet assay in bone marrow cell the largest databas for in vivo assay exist for the liver unschedul dna synthesi ud assay a review of the literatur show that a combin of the liver ud test and the bone marrow micronucleus test will detect most genotox carcinogen with few fals posit result tweat 1994 unstabl genotoxin and certain aromat amin are problemat for all exist in vivo screen the choic of a second test howev should not be restrict to ud test becaus other assay may be more appropri eg 32 p post label dna strand breakag assay etc depend on the compound in question 6 the bone marrow is a well perfus tissu and it can be deduc therefor that level of drug relat materi in blood or plasma will be similar to those observ in bone marrow this is support by direct comparison of drug level in the two compart for a larg seri of differ pharmaceut although drug level are not alway the same there is suffici correl for measur in blood or plasma to be adequ for valid bone marrow exposur 7 laboratori in japan carri out genotox test have much experi in test precipit and have identifi exampl of substanc that are clear genotox onli in the precipit rang of concentr these compound includ polym and mixtur of compound some polycycl hydrocarbon some phenylen diamin heptachlor etc collabor studi with some of these compound have shown that they may be detect in the solubl rang howev it doe seem clear that genotox activ increas well into the insolubl rang a discuss of these factor is found in the report of the in vitro subgroup of the melbourn confer kirkland 1994 8 test compound in the precipit rang is problemat with respect to defin the exposur period for assay where the cell grow in suspens after the defin exposur period the cell are normal pellet by centrifug and are then resuspend in fresh medium without the test compound if a precipit is present the compound will be carri through to the later stage of the assay make control of exposur imposs if such cell are use eg human peripher lymphocyt or mous lymphoma cell it is reason to use the lowest precipit concentr as the highest concentr test 9 as the induct of micronuclei and chromosom aberr are relat it is reason to assum that the same condit can be appli for use male anim in bone marrow chromosom aberr assay the peripher blood micronucleus test has been valid onli in male rodent the collabor studi group for the micronucleus test 1992 as has the ex vivo ud test madl et al 1994 10 a detail collabor studi was carri out under the auspic of the japanes environment mutagen societi the collabor studi group for the

we hit these cell with lethal dose of hydrogen peroxid but it didnt kill them off so the cell must have some way of remov or repair damag it turn out they do some of the bodi enzym function as a

while yet a third group nucleas and glycosylas actual repair the dna initi cell are abl to combat this bombard but the cumul effect of this damag over time may diminish the cell abil to make these

of free radic hochstein and his colleagu have found that when oxygen flow is restor to the heart the free radic transform oxygen into hydrogen peroxid then the hydrogen peroxid convert myoglobin which normal transport oxygen to the muscl into a toxic enzym like substanc that damag the heart explain hochstein not all the damag sustain dure a heart attack can be attribut to free radic reaction but they are a key element research are monitor the effect of antioxid such as beta caroten and vitamin a c and e to combat cancer we found that smoker who eat leafi green veget which are rich in vitamin

to includ substanti number of geriatr patient eg hypertens the guidelin appli also to new formul and new combin of establish medicin product when there is specif reason to expect that condit common in the elder eg renal or hepat impair impair cardiac function concomit ill or concomit medic are like to be encount and are not alreadi dealt with in current label it likewis appli when the new formul or new combin is like to alter the geriatr patient respons with regard to either safeti toler or efficaci compar with that of the non geriatr patient in a way differ from previous formul the guidelin also appli to new use that have signific potenti applic to the elder it is recommend that exempt from the guidelin be determin in advanc either by sponsor or where feasibl by the sponsor and drug registr author base eg on estim of the diseas preval by age or through examin of the age distribut of usag for other drug of the same class or drug use for the same indic iv definit of the popul the

protocol should not ordinarili includ arbitrari upper age cutoff it is also import not to exclud unnecessarili patient with concomit ill it is onli by observ such patient that drug diseas interact can be detect the older the popul like to use the drug the more import it is to includ the veri old v clinic experi geriatr patient should be includ in the phase 3 databas and in phase 2 at the sponsor option in meaning number the geriatr subpopul should be repres suffici to permit the comparison of drug respons in them to that of younger patient for drug use in diseas not uniqu to but present in the elder a minimum of 100 patient would usual allow detect of clinic import differ for drug to treat relat uncommon diseas smaller number of the elder would be expect where the diseas to be treat is characterist associ with age eg alzheim diseas it is expect that geriatr patient will constitut the major portion of the clinic databas the overal databas of the dossier should be examin for the presenc of age relat differ eg in advers event rate in effect and in dose respons if these relat crude overview analys show import differ further evalu may be need the geriatr data use in the overview can come either from the inclus of elder patient in all or most of the main phase 3 or phase 2 3 studi or from studi conduct exclus in geriatr patient at the sponsor option inclus of both group in the same studi has the advantag of allow direct comparison of younger and older patient use data collect in similar way such comparison are more difficult when separ studi of young and old patient are use certain assess howev eg studi of cognit function requir special plan and can be best accomplish in separ studi vi pharmacokinet studi most of the recogn import differ between younger and older patient have been pharmacokinet differ often relat to impair of excretori renal or hepat function or to drug drug interact it is import to determin whether or not the pharmacokinet behavior of the drug in elder subject or patient is differ from that in younger adult and to character the effect of influenc such as abnorm renal or hepat function that are more common in the elder even though they can occur in ani age group inform regard age relat differ in the pharmacokinet of the drug can come at the sponsor option either from a pharmacokinet screen as describ subsequ or from formal pharmacokinet studi in the elder and in patient with excretori function impair it is recogn that for certain drug and applic eg some topic appli agent some protein technic limit such as low system drug level may preclud or limit explor of age relat pharmacokinet differ a formal pharmacokinet studi formal pk studi can be done either in healthi geriatr subject or in patient volunt with the diseas to be treat by the drug the initi pk studi can be a pilot trial of limit size conduct under steadi state condit to look for sizabl differ between older and younger subject or patient a larger singl dose pk studi of suffici size to permit statist comparison between geriatr and younger subject or patient pharmacokinet profil is also accept in either case if larg ie potenti medic import age relat differ are found the initi pk studi may need to be follow by a multipl dose pk studi of suffici size to permit statist comparison geriatr vs younger at steadi state b pharmacokinet screen approach sponsor may opt instead of conduct a separ pk evalu of the elder to util a pharmacokinet screen in conjunct with the main phase 3 and phase 2 if the sponsor wish clinic trial program this screen procedur involv obtain under steadi state condit a small number one or two of drug blood level determin at trough ie just prior to the next dose or other defin time from suffici number of phase 2 3 clinic trial patient geriatr and younger to detect age associ differ in pharmacokinet behavior if they are present it is import to record time of dose prior to blood concentr measur and relat of dose to meal and to examin the influenc of demograph and diseas factor such as gender renal function presenc of liver diseas gastrointestin diseas or heart diseas bodi size and composit and concomit ill small differ are unlik to be of medic import where the screen detect larg differ formal pharmacokinet studi may be indic unless the screen result are suffici inform the advantag of a pharmacokinet screen is that it can assess the effect not onli of age itself but also of other factor associ with age alter bodi composit other drug concomit ill and their interact vii pharmacokinet in renal or hepat impair patient renal impair is an age associ find that can also occur in younger patient therefor it is a general principl not specif to these guidelin that drug excret parent drug or activ metabolit signific through renal mechan should be studi to defin the effect of alter renal function on their pharmacokinet such inform is need for drug that are the subject of this guidelin but it can be obtain in younger subject with renal impair similar drug subject to signific hepat metabol and or excret or that have activ metabolit may pose special problem in the elder pharmacokinet studi should be carri out in hepat impair young or elder patient volunt if a pharmacokinet screen approach is chosen by the sponsor section vi see abov and if patient with document renal impair or hepat impair depend on the drug elimin pattern are includ and the result indic no medic import pharmacokinet differ that inform may be suffici to meet this geriatr guidelin purpos viii pharmacodynam dose respons studi the number of age relat pharmacodynam differ ie increas or decreas therapeut respons or side effect at a given plasma concentr of drug discov to date is too small to necessit dose respons or other pharmacodynam studi in geriatr patient as a routin requir separ studi are howev recommend in the follow situat sedat hypnot agent and other psychoact drug or drug with import cns effect such as sedat antihistamin where subgroup comparison geriatr versus younger in the phase 2 3 clinic trial databas indic potenti medic signific age associ differ in the drug effect or advers reaction profil not explain by pk differ ix drug drug interact studi such interact are of particular import to geriatr patient who are more like to be use concomit medic than younger patient but of cours are not limit to this age group therefor it is a general principl not specif to these guidelin that in case where the therapeut rang ie rang of toxic to therapeut dose of the drug or like concomit drug is narrow and the likelihood of the concomit therapi is great that specif drug drug interact studi be consid the studi need must be determin case by case but the follow are ordinarili recommend digoxin and oral anticoagul interact studi becaus so mani drug alter serum concentr of these drug they are wide prescrib in the elder and they have narrow therapeut rang for drug that undergo extens hepat metabol determin of the effect of hepat enzym induc eg phenobarbit and inhibitor eg cimetidin for drug metabol by cytochrom p 450 enzym it is critic to examin the effect of known inhibitor such as quinidin

meat and other fatti food as well as high cholesterol level to colorect cancer but research had virtual no idea what role cholesterol play in tumor format now a uc berkeley group has found that a chemic crucial to the format of cholesterol is necessari for the function of a gene that trigger tumor format in the pancrea colon and rectum their research report in today issu of the journal scienc suggest that diet and the use of drug that interfer with cholesterol metabol might be use to prevent and perhap even treat certain form of cancer their research also provid a strong rational for current effort to prevent colorect cancer by eat food low in fat and high in fiber that reduc cholesterol level oncologist robert mayer of the harvard medic school call the studi an eleg observ that may provid the first step in link epidemiolog evid to cancer mechan colorect cancer is second onli to lung cancer as a caus of death of the 151 000 american who contract colorect cancer each year 62 000 die pancreat cancer is fifth in number of death and has an extrem high mortal rate account for 25 000 death among 27 000 case annual colorect cancer occur much more common in industri countri that

of colorect cancer with high level of cholesterol in the bloodstream one studi show for exampl that individu with cholesterol level in the highest 20 were more than twice as like to develop tumor as those in the lowest 20 research have had a difficult time explain the biochem mechan involv in these find current the most wide accept theori is that high level of fat in the colon increas the percentag of organ there that might produc carcinogen this theori mayer note has been particular difficult to prove smoke link pancreat cancer in contrast has not been strong associ with diet the onli well known risk factor for it is smoke but the two type of cancer share one trait at least 50 of pancreat tumor and 90 of colorect tumor are thought to be trigger at least in part by the ras oncogen oncogen are gene normal found in cell that when activ under certain condit trigger unrestrain prolifer of cell in other word a tumor although research do not yet know how the ras oncogen oper they do know one crucial fact the protein produc from it call the ras protein must be bound to the cell membran befor it can signal the cell to begin divid and develop into a tumor geneticist jasper rine and william schafer of uc berkeley discov that in yeast the ras protein is bound to the membran by a molecul that is convert into cholesterol if the molecul call farnesyl pyrophosph is not present in the yeast the ras protein cannot bind to the yeast cell membran and stimul cellular prolifer becaus the yeast ras oncogen is veri similar to it human counterpart the berkeley scientist began collabor with chemist sung hou kim and his colleagu at the lawrenc berkeley laboratori to studi the human gene in their key experi they inject the human ras protein into frog egg and found that it stimul the egg to divid but when they simultan inject a drug call lovastatin which is use to reduc cholesterol level in human by block it synthesi they found that the ras protein had no effect on the egg simpli put kim said drug that block cholesterol synthesi block ras protein activ and thus should block cancer cell from prolifer much more specul is the possibl that cholesterol block drug or food could kill exist tumor but kim suggest that becaus everi cell in a tumor has to have the ras protein anchor to the membran interf with cholesterol synthesi could halt or even revers this process and shrink the tumor our find open new avenu for investig these cancer and potenti for treat them with cholesterol reduc drug which are safer than current therapi which have mani potent side effect rine said kim note that the group plan to begin studi this in mice in the near futur normal level of cholesterol are necessari to the cell which use it in build membran appar onli the excess cholesterol is use for anchor the

calcium supplement can retard bone loss associ with osteoporosi but onli in older women who have been postmenopaus for at least five year and who have calcium defici diet a studi publish in thursday new england journal of medicin reveal among women who have been postmenopaus five year or less calcium supplement appear ineffect in prevent a veri rapid phase of bone loss said dr bess dawson hugh chief of the calcium and bone metabol laboratori at the usda human nutrit research center on age at tuft univers in boston but after about five year calcium supplement appear to kick in prevent further bone deterior that where the good news is if you are out of that rapid dip period and if you have a low dietari intak then increas your calcium to the recommend dietari allow has a veri substanti benefit she said past research on the effect of calcium supplement has yield mix result becaus most studi have fail to distinguish between women who are recent postmenopaus and those who are well beyond menopaus dawson hugh said as a result calcium is wide held as import in prevent bone loss but medic expert have not agre on the need for supplement you have to look at subset of the postmenopaus popul dawson hugh said we had enough peopl here that we could partit them into subset and therebi develop more of an idea of what was go on the studi is clear on two other point women who alreadi achiev high calcium intak through their diet do not need supplement and supplement of calcium citrat malat a form patent by procter gambl and found in citrus hill plus calcium orang and grapefruit juic appear to be better absorb than calcium carbon the more popular form found in over the counter product such as tum dawson hugh said the studi examin 301 healthi postmenopaus women age 40 to 70 for two year half of the women had a usual dietari calcium intak of less than 400 milligram a day about two serv of calcium rich food women with dietari calcium intak of 400 to 650 milligram

subgroup those who receiv 500 milligram of calcium carbon those who receiv 500 milligram of calcium citrat malat and those who receiv a placebo bone measur were taken in the neck spine and forearm the result show that women who had undergon menopaus five or fewer year earlier had signific bone loss that was unaffect by supplement in ani form at menopaus the femal hormon estrogen which help protect against bone loss begin to declin rapid among recent postmenopaus women we found that the calcium supplement didnt seem to matter dawson hugh said the bone seem to be under such strong influenc of the bodi drop estrogen level but after about five year the supplement appear to prevent further bone loss in women defici in calcium the studi is encourag becaus it suggest that calcium can help prevent bone loss which has been disput by some research said bonni liebman a nutritionist for the center for scienc in the public interest in washington i dont think women who have recent undergon menopaus should say im not go to worri about calcium for five year but liebman said the studi find that calcium citrat malat was more effect than calcium carbon deserv follow up studi becaus the former is general more cost and avail onli in citrus hill plus calcium fruit juic the studi doe not reveal whether calcium carbon would be more effect in higher dose or if taken with food liebman said the subject took the supplement without food the studi found women with lower dietari calcium intak who consum calcium citrat malat had no signific bone loss women who receiv calcium carbon maintain bone densiti in the hip and forearm but lost bone in the spine the women on the placebo lost 2 to 3 of bone densiti at the hip forearm and spine over two year among women with higher dietari calcium intak there were no differ among subject take either form of calcium supplement or the placebo this fit with the idea that supplement benefit those who are defici dawson hugh said but more and more and more is not better and better and better women in america in this age rang have an intak of 475 milligram a day that veri littl just over half the rda of what they need dawson hugh said i would promot the

game with the blue jay had been rain out and the player had a coupl of hour to kill befor fli on to detroit onc minton would have push his consider belli up to the bar but the 1989 greg minton stare at his book and practic self control i would have love to go in there but i sat in the lobbi and read my book like a good littl boy he said later greg minton onc stole the team bus now hes one of the first guy aboard he use to eat drink and make merri until dawn then sleep into the afternoon now hes up earli has run a few mile befor breakfast and can look forward to a hearti salad and a coupl of ice tea for lunch my metabol aint what it use to be said minton 38 forc a smile minton may not parti as much as he onc did but he feel a lot better about himself onc a 248 pound behemoth who elicit jeer from the hometown fan in san francisco whenev he warm up which wasnt often hes now a svelt crowd favorit who lead the team with 14 appear he has a 69 earn run averag with three save and has been a vital factor in the angel earli success the way greg pitch now hes invalu manag doug rader said he has the abil to be a set up guy to come in in the earli inning and get us out of a precari situat or be a closer hes just done an except job minton has chang his act but there one thing he has retain from the earli 80s when he was one of the nation leagu premier reliev a nasti sink fastbal hes got a realli great arm catcher lanc parrish said i love the way he throw the ball wish i could make a ball move like that the ball look like it in a good spot to hit but then when you commit it sudden drop down the bottom just fall out of it there was a time when minton life match that descript minton marri at 17 and when the marriag fell apart his career follow suit he gain weight and lost interest in the game the biggest thing was the divorc minton said and then i lost a custodi battl for my kid let just say i was not a happi camper to be honest basebal had becom veri secondari in my life minton record 111 save for the giant between 1980 and 1984 in 1982 he had a 10 4 record 30 save and a 83 era but the fan in san francisco quick forgot when his waistlin bulg and his save total shrank it was nobodi fault but my own minton said i mean i was total out of shape and the giant were pay me a good sum of money to do a job im not sure anyon should have to endur some of the choic word that were direct toward me and my famili it was my fault singl for the first time sinc high school minton took too much advantag of be a singl human be you can read into that what you will but somehow minton had lost the youth exuber that character his earli day in the major after all there is a certain lighthearted in swipe the team bus to go buy boot as he onc did in houston and then drive it to the park or hang glide his way to a 200 fine on a day off or trick a teammat into knock on the manag hotel room door at 4 in the morn but there is noth lightheart about carous and get fat i certain didnt set out to let myself go he said i gain a few pound then a few more and weigh 220 befor i realiz i had a problem i made a few halfheart effort to catch myself but then minton met his current wife brenda and he found the inspir he need togeth they began the climb back up minton was 1 1 with one save and a 47 era when the giant releas him on may 28 1987 five day later the angel pick him up in more way than one three thing stick in my mind about those first day with the angel minton said when i first got here pitch coach marcel lachemann ask me how my arm felt i said i hadnt pitch in five day but i felt fine he told me to be readi for the late inning then former manag gene mauch call me into his offic and said he didnt care what hed heard that he had no preconceiv notion that i was start from scratch as far as he was concern i pitch that first night in new york then i pitch again on our first night back in anaheim when i came to the mound i heard cheer i went home to tell brenda but i couldnt put into word the way it made me feel brenda is minton fit director and dure the off season has him run 10 mile everi morn they both adher to a strict diet and he regular work out with a former us nation taekwondo coach near his home in gilbert ariz minton onc went more than three season without allow a home run while set a major leagu record of 269 1 3 consecut inning without give up a homer he just set the angel club record with 88 1 3 inning former giant manag frank robinson onc said he thought minton could pitch the ninth inning of all 162 game if he had to but the arm that wouldnt die need rest now make his fourth appear in five game last saturday minton gave up a two run doubl a walk and a warn track sacrific fli while face just three toronto batter im learn thing about my bodi at this age minton said it use to be the more i threw the more the ball sank now im learn that even if i feel fine sometim i dont have the arm speed i need if ive been out there too mani

product in his patient new drug are constant be develop becaus the standard therapi is inadequ forman say but children are left out of these advanc as pediatrician we are alway behind and alway depend on guesswork onli about 20 of new drug are evalu in children befor they get fda approv the rest usual end up describ this way in the physician desk refer the standard text that provid doctor with pharmaceut manufactur instruct safeti and effect in children have not been establish it doe not mean physician cant use the drug but that they have no data to guid their use say dr wayn r snodgrass chief of clinic pharmacolog at the univers of texa medic branch in galveston like kauffman he is among about a dozen specialist nation in pediatr pharmacolog under such circumst doctor will adjust for a child size and factor in differ in infant metabol and physiolog to cut the recommend adult dosag they may consult by telephon with doctor more experienc in use the drug they may search the pediatr medic journal for an account of the drug perform under similar circumst in young patient but it is a rough calcul at best most of the inhal asthma drug for exampl are not approv for use by young children yet thousand of youngster depend upon them for relief of wheez and cough and have for more than a decad accord to dr gari rachelefski the los angel allergi specialist say he has been studi the use of inhal steroid in asthmat children sinc 1974 and virtual all of the drug use to treat the life threaten condit of prematur babi have not been approv for use in children snodgrass say whi pharmaceut compani market drug without adequ test in children is the subject of a long run debat sever medic confer were held on the issu as far back as 1974 but the situat has chang littl sinc then late though the debat has taken on greater urgenc as more children with serious long term ill such as acquir immun defici syndrom certain cancer and other immun compromis condit confront the dearth of drug scientif evalu for pediatr use in addit the relat small number of children with chronic heart problem high blood pressur or other diseas more common seen in adult have alway had to depend on adjust dosag of adult medic but requir pediatr test as a condit of approv rais a differ set of problem fda spokesman mike shaffer say first the fda is not author to requir such test shaffer say congress would have to give the agenc addit muscl shaffer say to order pediatr drug test as a condit for market approv second long delay alreadi character the progress of new drug from test tube to market a journey averag seven to 10 year accord to jeffrey l trewhitt spokesman for the pharmaceut manufactur assn the associ repres about 100 drug compani that develop most of the new drug in the unit state and europ drug develop doe not come cheapli either averag 125 million in up front cost for each drug that clear the fda trewhitt say the agenc worri that a pediatr test requir would further slow the process and sinc new drug develop depend great upon a drug compani willing to absorb the cost the fda is reluct to discourag the industri with addit regul the popul of serious ill children is so small that it doesnt justifi a drug compani troubl and expens to seek approv in this area say the fdas shaffer for it part the pharmaceut industri play down the profit factor justifi decis not to test certain drug on children on ethic and legal ground from the ethic standpoint the concern is that children can be more vulner trewhitt say they rais more cancer concern than adult becaus they are still grow there is also a concern that test experiment drug in children could affect growth in a key bodi organ and legal product liabil lawsuit abound in this countri but kauffman decri such justif as a disingenu cop out you can see that when there is an econom incent they have done the work kauffman say point to drug common use to treat condit that affect larg number of children in order to get fda approv for pediatr use drug compani have voluntarili test antibiot for the ear and respiratori infect that occur frequent in childhood as well as over the counter prepar for fever and cold but for the most part the drug compani dont voluntarili test more special drug that might be use by a smaller group of children to me kauffman say the most uneth thing to do is to subject kid to drug that have not been test in children so that each child becom an individu experi his caus is gain momentum the fda isnt ignor the problem and neither are we kauffman say the committe on drug of the pediatr academi now has a contract with the fda and we are work with them to identifi inform from medic journal and other sourc on drug use in children and compil it to includ in drug label also the institut of medicin of the nation institut of health has been suffici arous to conven a confer on the subject next april we have a long way to go say kauffman but there are some thing happen that give us

defin in a uniform way and it should be clear stipul that bankruptci mean be unabl to pay debt as they are due 4 as for the issu of placement of employe of bankrupt enterpris sinc the state council has alreadi issu rule there are no addit rule in the text 5 it is necessari to abolish some rule such as the rule that a petit in bankruptci or for amic settlement and consolid has to be approv by the enterpris supervisori agenc and endors by the worker congress after discuss 6 introduc the concept of the bankrupt creditor 7 shorten bankruptci case handl time and one measur in this regard will be to chang the time limit on file creditor claim from three month to two month 8 do not direct cite crimin law provis in the bankruptci law it would be adequ to just have the explicit word in accord with the relev crimin law provis 9 the work of establish liquid team should be regul by the market the main current obstacl he also said to the implement of the bankruptci law is that in the cours of implement the bankruptci system creditor especi the bank lack the enthusiasm for use the bankruptci law to protect their own econom interest the second is the issu of placement of employe of bankrupt enterpris china will see the emerg of a new industri the properti right trade industri and the emerg of the new occup of the merger produc he predict veri confid their busi is to trade in enterpris and trade in enterpris is not a bad thing they buy enterpris have the enterpris consolid transform and packag and then sell the enterpris after go through this process enterpris would emerg with entir new look and would have level of effici total differ from those in the past turn from money eat enterpris into money spit enterpris produc of enterpris merger would make a great deal of money through first devour and then throw up enterpris but such money is not made through exploit nation calam but made through benefit from competit and prosper professor xiao zhuoji of beij univers made five point with regard to the issu of merger and bankruptci first merger and bankruptci repres the object demand of a market economi under a market economi the law of surviv of the fittest is effect and it is inevit that some enterpris will face bankruptci at the same time some enterpris need to develop and grow and the main way to develop is to have merger second merger and bankruptci constitut an import way to have resourc alloc in an optimum manner and can result in limit resourc be transfer to sector and industri equip with advantag condit therebi produc economi of scale which are conduc to the develop of the social product forc third merger and develop themselv would improv the overal qualiti of enterpris to enterpris merger repres a drive forc and bankruptci repres a pressur becaus of such a drive forc and pressur everi enterpris must strive to improv the standard of it busi oper and manag otherwis it would face the danger of elimin fourth merger and bankruptci constitut an effect way to safeguard state properti a loss make enterpris is subsid by the state and the state loss are unlimit howev if the bankruptci method is use there will be some loss of state properti but the loss will be limit furthermor it is possibl to util the origin asset for make up the loss through transfer properti fifth merger and bankruptci also constitut an import way to maintain social stabil if some enterpris which should be liquid are kept aliv with difficulti it would seem on the surfac that worker are not unemploy and societi would seem stabl but societi resourc would be wast or remain idl and such a situat would mean the greatest instabl onli by adopt the merger and bankruptci method so as to achiev the optimum alloc of resourc develop the economi and improv effici would it be possibl to fundament ensur social stabil guan weili director of the enterpris depart of the bureau of state asset manag put forward ten idea on the issu of enterpris merger and bankruptci 1 enterpris bankruptci and merger are an indispens link in the market economi and merger and bankruptci constitut the main way of adjust the alloc of factor of product 2 bankruptci and merger can both be posit mean and constitut metabol let bankrupt enterpris control resourc mean wast resourc and it would be better to have bankrupt enterpris absorb by enterpris equip with advantag condit at the present stage it is proper to take larger step with respect to merger and bankruptci 3 the current situat of state own enterpris has two major characterist first the level of effici is low while the problem of asset washout is serious some enterpris cannot be save while some other are not suit to remain in their respect industri to them merger and bankruptci are good thing second the speed is high but the figur are inflat the situat is govern by plan but also unbalanc enterpris face a heavi task of carri out structur readjust 4 to have merger and bankruptci it is first of all necessari to clear defin properti right relationship and to make clear who have ownership we must have agenc which exercis ownership right over enterpris in the transit period enterpris supervisori agenc must continu to exercis supervisori and manag right 5 it is proper not to take away an enterpris legal person status after it has been absorb and this practic can serv as a nonstandard method and be reflect in some way in the futur enterpris merger law 6 to have enterpris merger as well as bankruptci it is necessari to transform the function of financi institut 7 amidst enterpris bankruptci and merger it is

was releas from prison the two are live togeth happili onc again this is a stori about extrem behavior kasdan said the potenti is there i think for all of us to act in extrem way i wake up some morn with the most extrem thought either good or bad comedi about adulteri are almost as old as drama and murder plot base on adulteri have a long tradit in hollywood run right up through kasdan own 1981 film bodi heat and on to fatal attract but find humor in an offend spous actual murder attempt is relat unexplor territori and for good reason some would say in a societi where rise statist of domest violenc are no laugh matter the open credit that i love you to death is base on a true stori becom a startl piec of inform as the film unspool it farcic scenario of the simpl devot rosali play with unfamiliar anguish by comedienn tracey ullman tri inept to arrang the murder of her philand joey the movi version of toni play by a broad italian kevin kline when they offer it to me kasdan said of the screenplay by john kostmay the first script he has direct that he has not also written they told me this is a feminist movi he end up with a bullet in his head and it make him think and what he think is that he love his wife to me what the stori is about is that their love was so strong you couldnt kill that even have tri to murder him he still love her so there a symmetri there to me hes too full of life to die and so is their relationship produc jeffrey luri who arrang for the film to be made at tri star pictur describ the stori affection as that of a troubl but heroic coupl that was tri each from a differ perspect to save their marriag the toto who made their first trip to los angel this week to help launch the movi say they are thrill with it most of the scene are veri real attest toni a fit spright man of 44 who seem to be catch on quick to the hollywood promot spirit in his italian inflect english the movi is great it fantast we love it and it a messag for everybodi crime doesnt pay cheat doesnt pay which is not entir true if you consid the money the toto stand to make from their particip in the movi said to be close to six figur up front with a percentag deal tie to futur profit franc who is 45 and somewhat less ebulli than her husband said their children gave the film high mark as well they were laugh at kevin kline becaus hes got his toni manner down fantast she said seat besid toni in the librari at the st jamess club on sunset boulevard and his accent and all toni admit that the movi is somewhat funnier than the real event that brought him close to death and sent franc to prison for four year after plead guilti to crimin solicit to commit murder he rememb for exampl wake up in the hospit and feel scare and worri i couldnt understand whi my wife did this was it becaus i cheat on her or someth els at the same time i was pray to god pleas let me live doctor in allentown later specul that the chicken soup lace with barbitur may have actual save toni life by lower his metabol and slow the bleed from the gunshot wound a detail preserv in the film the bizarr case of the toto found it way to hollywood via a stori outlin prepar by two allentown polic offic familiar with the case barri giacobb and arthur beer eventu ron moler the produc of the comedi bachelor parti saw the outlin and option the right from the policemen and the toto and brought in screenwrit john kostmay to put a comic spin on the stori the comic possibl were pretti obvious said moler who convinc the initi skeptic toto to sign over the right to him toni was think about a book and i said this is a black comedi the idea of pump bullet into somebodi is not general funni and in fact that not what made us laugh said kostmay who also wrote the popular 1983 los angel play on the money the humor come from the contradict between what they franc and her co conspir want to accomplish and what they did accomplish it onli funni becaus the consequ were relat happi for the peopl involv kostmay acknowledg that some viewer could find the materi difficult i think some peopl are go to react bad to the irrever and the rabelaisian humor and the fact that the comedi is offer with the realism intact the term black comedi is sometim use to describ the comic interpret of otherwis dark or menac situat but the differ between i love you to death and recent black comedi like the war of the rose and shock to the system is it basi in truth it proxim to near calam kasdan said he didnt know this when he first read the script i read it and love it he said i thought it was sweet and touch he also said this is a stori that onc would have been on ripley believ it or not kasdan has made four other movi in the last decad bodi heat the big chill silverado and the accident tourist and consid them all to have been riski find the right tone is the challeng of a thing like this although it a challeng find the right tone with ani movi to what extent can you push the envelop in either direct and still have the piec be unifi whether your do a western or a comedi or a drama i think that true in a lot of what ive done i thought accident tourist was veri funni but veri sad too most of the comedi that come out of hollywood arent funni we spent two week in rehears to talk about what kind of movi we were make what kind of joke is accept there are thing that are differ from the real stori but the most outrag stuff in the movi all happen the drug daze hit men play by william hurt and keanu reev appar were just as feebl mind as they look on the screen in a miscalcul that spare toni life the real would be killer recit the pledg of allegi to each other at his bedsid in an effort to rememb on which side of the chest the heart is locat the gunmen still got it wrong and shot him in the right side miss his heart by an inch in a way everybodi would like to be as free as joey said kasdan you may not applaud his promiscu but what is appeal about him is that he has this enorm appetit for life and sort of goe at it without much conscienc you know he enjoy everi minut of his day hes not an admir charact necessarili but hes human in less extrem form we all do this everi day i think this is what all the movi ive made have been about which is this battl go on between your desir and your ideal that what bodi heat is about the guy know what right but what he want is veri strong and it overcom what he know is right that what the big chill is about that what life is about to me tri to reconcil what you know to be the correct behavior with what you want to do i knew it was wrong toni admit at the st jamess club about his behavior becaus of what it was do to my famili but i just blank everyth out and just go on and kept do what i was do franc to judg from the movi never thought to confront toni about his infidel befor leap to her radic solut did she ever discuss it with him well i would tri to she said befor be interrupt by her husband she tri to a littl bit he interject but i just said eh dont bother and i make up some excus and she just gave up in the film she learn of his infidel when she spot him with anoth woman but in truth she never actual saw him with ani of his girlfriend thank god she said no i never got caught toni said with what sound like pride i had so mani peopl call me and tell franc continu i think if more peopl had mind their own

particl appear to be quit persist in the satur salin sediment of eagl river flat but volatil as sediment dri below 20 percent moistur ref 23 factor that affect persist of white phosphorus in sediment includ sediment poros moistur content and temperatur all of which interact to determin the rate of sublim oxygen may slow sublim by the format of oxid product around the particl that impos a diffus barrier to white phosphorus vapor use data on the dissolut rate of white phosphorus particl in water ref 15 walsh ref 23 estim the dissolut of a 1 mm diamet white phosphorus sphere to be 8 year the

we eat primarili veget grain nut fruit she say of her famili of four which includ a 4 year old daughter and a 12 year old son i would much rather have veget than meat it take 13 pound of grain to make one pound of meat and im ethic against that she say she admit that some of the organ produc cost more than commerci produc but she think it worth it becaus it grown without pesticid knoy isnt alon a lot of other peopl in orang counti are worri about what most american are eat they are worri about the thousand of pesticid and chemic that are use on veget fruit and grain they are worri about how far remov from it natur state much of our diet has becom they are worri about our planet and how we can continu to feed it burgeon popul and they are worri about what some perceiv as cruelti to anim in our food chain these concern have creat a grow demand for food that is as close as possibl to it natur state and this demand has given birth to a new kind of groceri store in orang counti the natur grocer as well as mother market and kitchen in costa mesa and huntington beach are among a number of groceri store in southern california that special in organ and non process food with a heavi emphasi on vegetarian diet in los angel counti for exampl mrs gooch natur food has seven store mani health food store carri some organ food and even a few supermarket includ pavilion and mayfair market carri a small amount of organ produc but the natur grocer mother market and mrs gooch repres a whole new idea a full servic groceri store devot to a lifestyl that center on healthi eat mother was start 13 year ago so that shopper would have access to high qualiti whole food without have to go to the old style mom and pop health food store which were primarili vitamin shop say steven markel vice presid of oper for the market the huntington beach store open five year ago each locat includ a restaur a health food delicatessen a larg select of health relat book and a cosmet counter when we start the store was one quarter the size that it current is markel say of the 11 000 squar foot costa mesa store the fact of our success demonstr an increas concern and awar on the part of our orang counti communiti of the import of whole clean food by whole clean food markel mean organ fruit and veget grown without chemic and pesticid and minim process and packag food that lack addit such as preserv and artifici flavor and color that are low in fat and salt that have littl or no sugar and are minim process the natur grocer open in august to serv the need of south counti health food enthusiast accord to store manag vicki stern were more like a natur food groceri store than a health food store stern say were a full servic groceri store we not onli have all our natur food you would find in a health food store but weve got a veri larg produc depart which most health food store dont have we have a beauti cosmet counter we have a jewelri and crystal galleri and we have a full servic deli and bakeri with a lot of gourmet vegetarian item the natur grocer carri no meat becaus it is a complet vegetarian store accord to stern mother market howev carri free rang chicken and turkey poultri allow to roam free rather than be rais in cage markel say these item are offer becaus there is a demand for it and we tri to be as conscienti as we can he point out howev that this particular poultri is select becaus it is grown without hormon and other growth stimul were a cruelti free store stern say it just mean there no harm inflict on ani anim to creat ani of the product in our store in view of the case of veggi burger and tofu pup made from a soybean base product the larg bin of bulk food and babi food made from organ veget may seem a bit odd to the unschool but shopper at these market find the bin invalu i would like to feed my famili as few artifici chemic as i can susan rousset of newport beach said while shop at mother i just prefer that and also i like to support the farmer that do want to maintain the earth as best they can rousset is experi with a macrobiot diet whole grain bean veget and moder amount of seafood and fruit but she still cook meat occasion for her six children rang in age from 4 to 16 she say howev that they are most vegetarian too this vari approach to vegetarian is not unusu there are sever school of thought accord to markel there are lacto ovo vegetarian who eat dairi product egg grain fruit legum and veget then there are those who will eat all of those item except egg or all of those item except dairi product then there are vegan who eat onli plant sourc food and there are peopl who are not fulli vegetarian yet but want to eat in a more healthi manner accord to markel but is vegetarian realli a healthi way to eat there noth wrong with vegetarian say grant gwinup md a professor of endocrinolog and metabol at uci medic center the onli studi avail suggest that vegetarian live longer than non vegetarian but it hard to know how other factor contribut to that increas longev the main thing vegetarian need to worri about he say is the lack of vitamin b 12 and iron veget dont contain b 12 he say and women run the risk of get too littl iron when not eat meat but this doe not mean vegetarian should automat take vitamin and iron supplement he say as for the iron he say that can be solv by use an iron dutch oven when cook veget casserol gwinup say it a good idea for vegetarian to have their blood check onc a year to watch for ani anemia that might result from these defici he say that while vegetarian frequent claim perfect health there no magic in it there no evid that it has medicin properti or protect properti yet vegetarian interview while they were shop at mother and the natur grocer say they absolut have never felt better chef juli faust who supervis the delicatessen at the natur grocer say she talk to a lot of newcom to vegetarian as well as peopl who are gradual chang the way they eat she say the clientel in the laguna niguel store is differ from that of most health food store she has work in it veri yuppi the peopl here are just learn how to do thing without meat she say that whi she call the fare in her delicatessen a yup scale version of health food they go for the lasagna the pizza the spinach pie becaus it at least familiar she say her goal is to provid the same tast and flavor found in gourmet restaur but without the fat and meat this mean low fat pizza and dish like santa fe lasagna which has noodl black bean chop chili and pepper corn spici salsa and either jalapeno chees or creami cilantro tofu while the delicatessen in the store do a thrive busi the produc area are also popular yet the produc sign may also seem a bit odd to the newcom each item is

thing is not about be chemic free in our live but reduc our exposur everi littl bit we can markel say one argument goe that pesticid have never been proven to be harm but that it also true that theyv never been proven to be safe so what true is it a crap shoot and we realli dont know what the long term cumul effect are but he say we do know that cancer birth defect and other health problem may be

this earthi assess of america physic fit it becaus he is american larg have ignor more than two decad of advic that they sweat their way into tiptop cardiovascular shape the dalla epidemiologist say so it time to give them a new messag a littl bit of exercis is good enough and blair realli mean it with a recent studi at dalla institut for aerob research as a guid he has develop what he think is the bare minimum a person has to do to vast reduc the risk of die prematur and it isnt all that much no you dont have to get up daili at the crack of dawn to huff and puff through the street no you dont have to find a babi sitter avail for just one hour a day seven day a week a brisk two mile walk three time a week is all it take blair say for men the two mile should be cover in 27 minut or less for women 30 minut or less if you cant walk at that 3 to 4 mph pace at first you can take up to 40 minut in the begin but women would have to do it five to six day a week and men six or seven day a week judg by the aerob point system which classifi exercis base on how much oxygen it caus one to use that amount to a minimum of 15 aerob point a week for women and 18 aerob point a week for men other exercis ad up to that total amount could be substitut for the walk he note peopl under 50 need a bit more exercis than the minimum and peopl over 50 can get by with a bit less it doesnt make ani differ what you do as long as you expend the energi blair said but that about half as much exercis as has been advoc for the last two decad by dr kenneth cooper the fit guru who coin the term aerob back in 1968 cooper found the cooper clinic and the aerob institut where blair doe his research cooper who co author the recent studi on which blair base his recommend agre that it time to emphas that peopl dont have to train like florenc griffith joyner to gain the health benefit of exercis this new exercis prescript for the mass doesnt even look like a routin physic condit program all it realli is is avoid inact cooper say i think there are at least 30 million american out there who are die younger than they need to just becaus theyr total inact he said they say im not an athlet i dont have time i dont have the money well weve elimin those excus now becaus you dont have to join a health club you dont have to buy expens equip you dont have to have a friend or partner to play with you cooper said in a novemb paper base on data collect at the cooper clinic research show that the largest differ in mortal about 60 was between the sedentari and peopl who were onli moder fit as judg by perform on treadmil exercis test over an 11 year period the sedentari men had an overal death rate of 64 per 10 000 person year of particip in the studi the moder fit had a death rate of 26 per 10 000 person year among women the mortal rate fell from 40 to 16 this translat into one to three extra year of life for the moder fit blair said furthermor improv one fit beyond this moder level did decreas mortal but not by much the high fit group had death rate of 20 per 10 000 person year for men and seven per 10 000 for women in other word especi if your a man you dont have to becom an exercis fanat to gain most of the death postpon benefit of exercis to quantifi the exercis need blair compar the studi find to the exercis record kept on peopl who work out at an aerob center affili with the cooper clinic how much week exercis did it take for those peopl to have treadmil time classifi them as moder fit by the studi standard he ask the result was the recommend a survey last year by the us center for diseas control found that onli 8 of american get as much exercis as govern health offici recommend that recommend basic is that healthi adult should spend 15 to 25 minut a day three to four day a week do some form of exercis vigor enough to elev breath and heart rate but not so vigor that it becom imposs to talk comfort the american colleg of sport medicin recommend exercis session of 15 to 60 minut three to five day a week the survey found anoth 34 of adult were regular activ which the cdc defin as do some kind of physic activ at least three time a week for a minimum of 20 minut each time if that 34 exercis a bit more and other american could be coax off their live room couch there would be less fat more muscl and fewer earli death blair say such advic is of particular import for california burgeon latino popul govern survey show obes which is a factor in mani chronic diseas to be higher among latino than other ethnic group among latino middl school student in the montebello school district 51 of girl and 41 of boy had bodi fat composit in the high or veri high level a studi by cal poli pomona research found the nation hispan health and nutrit survey found that among mexican american adult 39 of women and 31 of men are overweight near half of those women and a third of those men are sever overweight for the averag american the modifi cooper clinic exercis prescript in essenc promot the idea of a new categori of physic fit one beyond the high fit imag that advertis give ad impli that the onli exercis is the extrem vigor kind and that it is the sole provinc of the young the beauti and the physic gift blair said these peopl dont look like most of us look were not all young and lean and attract blair say as he laugh point to his own bald head and chunki physiqu my mother look at those ad and she say well i can never look like that im too old and fat and therefor to heck with it im one of the slob there is a dichotom view of exercis in the mind of the american public blair say your either jane fonda a marathon runner a triathlet or your a slob when in fact this is a continuum for peopl who have troubl stick with an exercis program scienc has more good news there are hint that both sporad exercis and shorter bout of it are like a good health pill for the bodi biochem chang from just a few exercis session includ greater insulin sensit of cell result in better carbohydr metabol and lower level of fat carri triglycerid in the blood said william haskel associ professor of medicin at stanford univers and as the exercis prescript move toward be more real so are the activ that one can use to fill it a 1987 studi at the univers of minnesota found that men who got an averag of 47 minut a day of exercis main by mow the lawn garden and work around the hous had mark fewer heart attack death than did sedentari men and as in the blair research mortal didnt improv much beyond that in men of higher fit level furthermor although a rule of thumb in the past has been that one need to expend at least 2 000 calori week on vigor sustain exercis to gain cardiovascular benefit these men averag about 1 500 calori a week on activ that amount main to putter around the hous gail weldon a los angel athlet trainer who special in fit train for individu said she agre with the blair cooper push to move american away from think of themselv as exercis nobodi if they arent run marathon regular howev peopl look for a person fit prescript should keep in mind the need for flexibl and gradual muscl strengthen she said obvious we have to have the heart and lung work well to increas our longev but i work on so mani of the musculoskelet pain that i also emphas that you need to have some flexibl in the muscl to support the structur around them weldon said regular stretch and mild weight train can address those issu and even improv balanc in the elder she said the institut for aerob research recent was fund by the nation institut on age to

the chemic in group d indic that the group c classif was base on minim evid the panel determin that epa group c classif was base on minim evid was due to the fact that the incid of liver tumor in male

that the 2 500 ppm dose use in the 2 year chronic studi exceed the maximum toler dose mtd base on the endpoint of hepat necrosi and the 500 ppm dose use in the chronic studi was inadequ to assess the

conclud that the 90 day subchron studi are a better measur of what would be an mtd base upon these find the peer review committe agre that the classif for propiconazol should remain a group c possibl human carcinogen and recommend against the previous use q viz 079 for risk assess purpos for the purpos of risk character the peer review committe recommend that the refer dose rfd approach should be

optic materi for use in invis light rang applic that had been propos by the govern industri research institut osaka item m 17 in tabl 1 was one of those most import experi conduct aboard the space shuttl the purpos of the experi was to establish the technolog for melt materi use no materi contain and to process the melt materi to creat new type of glass such as high puriti glass and high melt point glass the experi was conduct by have the materi float and held in place by mean of sound pressur the materi were melt by light and then solidifi by cool produc the high puriti and high melt point glass one of the purpos of develop these glass was to creat a glass with a higher infrar transmiss than that of the quartz glass use in convent optic fiber communic for use in the next generat optic communic network the space experi made it possibl to verifi the use of the ground develop technolog for float glass materi by mean of sound pressur the experi also involv test the float control

necessari not onli for serv as an auxiliari heater for melt a specimen but also for increas the safeti in handl the high temperatur molten fluid under weightless condit to further enhanc the cage function we use platinum cage coat with a carbon film carbon has poor wettabl against platinum prevent the platinum element from find it way into the molten specimen easili in addit the carbon film is use in prevent the molten fluid from stick to the cage spot observ of specimen the purpos for conduct the space experi includ the on the spot observ of the specimen float within the cage and the observ of the melt process via a fiber scope insert into the furnac howev this time we fail to obtain a clear view of the melt process due to the low resolut in the imag obtain through the fiber scope the poor resolut was attribut to the inabl to secur the specimen in a design posit when a larger rack space becom avail in the futur it will becom possibl to obtain clearer imag by introduc a reflect optic observ system observ of melt specimen in order to observ the behavior of the specimen use in the first experi a cobalt marker was appli to the surfac of the specimen that was melt by be float by

that earlier the am academi of medic scienc also discuss repeat the problem of the central nervous system and the brain in particular the sixth session 1950 which was held joint with the ussr academi of scienc was devot to the develop of the teach of ip pavlov at the seventh session 1952 the first result were suppli the theme all diseas are due to a cortic disord the ninth session 1955 was the

at this session which encompass a wide rang of question we need to approv the scientif program the human brain we hope that this will be the first academ program that is support by state financ on which there is preliminari agreement the presidium of the ram russian academi of medic scienc also made the decis to conclud the scientif part of the session henceforth not with decre but with the adopt of scientif program the financ of the theme and project of which will be carri out on a competit grant basi experi has shown that the formul of state program with special purpos budget financ and their implement on the basi of an expert evalu and competit select dure the period of an acut financi shortag are the most advanc form of the plan coordin and support of the most promis scientif research and collect of scientist the program make it possibl to consolid the effort of research to set up temporari collect to halt in good time the financ of unpromis one and on the contrari to

far there is no concept of state polici of the develop of medic scienc in the countri sinc the judici legal status of scientif research and other institut and of the russian academi of medic scienc itself has not been determin the phrase from the edict of the presid of the russian feder that the function on the organ and coordin of medic scienc in the countri have been assign to the russian academi of medic scienc is well known but by other edict similar function have been assign to other ministri and depart and this phrase remain a phrase sinc legal and financi tie of the scientif council of the russian academi of medic scienc with higher educ institut and scientif research institut of the ministri of health and the state committe of sanitari epidemiolog supervis of the russian

to it by the presid of russia on the plan and coordin of medic scienc in the countri to conduct a qualifi examin of scientif research project and to plan the further develop of health care take what has been said into account sinc august 1992 a commiss which was set up by the presidium of the russian academi of medic scienc under the chairmanship of academician of the ram vd fedorov has been work

present has prepar document for the hold of parliamentari read which will take place in februari 1993 the necess of the law is determin by a number of circumst among which the most import one is the determin of the place of the academi and it institut in the system of the distribut of the form of properti state municip and privat in accord with the law on properti which was pass after the edict of the presid of 4 januari 1992 on the russian academi of medic scienc in the law the land ownership of other type of properti should also been attach to the academi and it institut sinc the lack of the same consider complic the activ of scientif collect further it is necessari to legal what was incorpor in the decre of the govern of juli 1992 and unfortun has thus far not been fulfil the determin of the level of financ of the academi and the social support of scientif associ of the academi and the assign to the academi of the expert evalu of scientif plan and the distribut of asset

it is possibl to continu this list but now is not the time to talk about success it is more import to find mean of escap a number of extrem negat trend that have occur the main one of them is the decreas amount of financ at the end of 1992 the amount of financ of scientif research of the academi came to r1 7 billion as compar with 1991 financ has increas by 87 fold moreov 24 3 percent of these asset r428 million were transfer to the academi onli on 25 decemb 1992 the amount of financ of clinic came to r3 001 000 000 alloc for the acquisit of equip and the capit repair of the build of clinic were envisag in the indic sum but 27 percent of the year asset were also transfer to the academi after 20 decemb how was it possibl in a week to spend these asset purpos and as a whole the increas of the amount of financ by the section scienc and clinic doe not offset the level of materi expenditur of municip servic which has increas by 15 to 30 fold and at clinic the level of the cost of foodstuff and medicin which has increas by 50 to 100 fold institut and organ have cut sharpli the purchas of equip and current outlay on scientif work and are not buy laboratori anim from nurseri which has led nurseri to the decreas of product volum as a result of which their financi posit is in a critic state the build of institut are fall to the ground sinc there are no asset for the perform of capit repair for prepar for oper under winter condit and for their mainten in proper condit an extrem serious situat has form at the clinic of scientif research institut the financi difficulti are be accompani by the lack of the necessari drug instrument equip and so on a signific amount of import equip is idl sinc there are no spare part for it and no reagent freeli convert currenc has not been allot to the russian academi of medic scienc for two year on 15 januari 1993 there were no control figur with respect to the budget for 1993 at the academi it is unknown whether fund will be alloc for the introduct as of 1 decemb 1992 of new salari in accord with the unifi wage scale financ for januari has been open in the amount of one third of the credit of the fourth quarter of 1992 it is natur that the financi crisi is advers affect the state of medic scienc the attempt at the commerci of medic scienc and the convers of scientif research institut to full self support and self financ are intensifi the mass departur of scientif associ moreov the best train one for work abroad under long term contract is be note here a third of the scientif institut of the ram have complet reject intern cooper the other have drastic restrict it volum the reason consist in the lack of asset for the fulfil of the oblig of the russian side within the framework of the sign agreement and first of all with respect to the receiv of foreign specialist and the send abroad of scientist of the russian academi of medic scienc attempt to establish parallel structur or structur that replac the russian academi of medic scienc state scientif center which are direct subordin to the ministri of scienc the higher school and technic polici of the russian feder the nation institut of health and so forth have taken away the right and function of the russian academi of medic scienc are be observ all the time is it worthwhil perhap to hear altern propos at the general meet of the academi especi as

socioeconom consequ of brain diseas of man in connect with this the problem of the neurosci should be group with prioriti problem it should be recal that earlier the am academi of medic scienc also discuss repeat the problem of the central nervous system and the brain in particular the sixth session 1950 which was held joint with the ussr academi of scienc was devot to the develop of the teach

competit select dure the period of an acut financi shortag are the most advanc form of the plan coordin and support of the most promis scientif research and collect of scientist the program make it possibl to consolid the effort of research to set up temporari collect to halt in good time the financ of unpromis one and on the contrari to strengthen promis one goal program financ is a tool by mean of which the russian academi of medic scienc can accomplish it main task to rais to a qualit new level basic and appli research in medicin the result of which will make a substanti chang in the notion of the process of vital activ of the healthi and ill person or will caus the radic improv of the method of diagnosi and treatment under present condit medic scienc just as the entir domest health care system is close to crisi the preserv of the academi of medic scienc it structur and the scientif potenti is a great achiev howev thus far there is no concept of state polici of the develop

the presid of the russian feder that the function on the organ and coordin of medic scienc in the countri have been assign to the russian academi of medic scienc is well known but by other edict similar function have been assign to other ministri and depart and this phrase remain a phrase sinc legal and financi tie of the scientif council of the russian academi of medic scienc with higher educ institut and scientif research institut of the ministri of health and the state committe of sanitari epidemiolog supervis of the russian feder and of other department affili are lack owe to this the indic institut do not submit to the scientif council and problem commiss plan and report of scientif research work each depart is introduc it own plan and report card which often are incompat with

of the russian feder the ministri of health of russia has drawn up anoth 38 sectori program moreov all the program are financ from the state budget bypass the russian academi of medic scienc there are also various foundat in the form situat it is obvious that the russian academi of medic scienc is unabl to perform the function assign to it by the presid of russia on the plan and coordin of medic scienc in the countri to conduct a qualifi examin of scientif research project and to plan the further develop of health care take what has been said into account sinc august 1992 a commiss which was set up by the presidium of the russian academi of medic scienc under the chairmanship of academician of the ram vd fedorov has been work on the prepar of the law on the develop of medic scienc and the place of our academi the commiss has been work togeth with the committe for health of the suprem soviet of the russian feder and at present has prepar document for the hold of parliamentari read which will take place in februari 1993 the necess of the law is determin by a number of circumst among which the most import one is the determin of the place of the academi and it institut in the system of the distribut of the form of properti state municip and privat in accord with the law on properti which was pass after the edict of the presid of 4 januari 1992 on the russian academi of medic scienc in the law the land ownership of other type of properti should also been attach to the academi and it institut sinc the lack of the same consider complic the activ of scientif collect further it is necessari to legal what was incorpor in the decre of the govern of juli 1992 and unfortun has thus far not been fulfil the determin of the level of financ of the academi and the social support of scientif associ of the academi and the assign to the academi of the expert evalu of scientif plan and the distribut of asset through grant in spite of the exist difficulti scientist of russia continu

condit and creat the foundat for the develop of fundament new approach to prevent and therapi new drug were obtain from local resourc it is possibl to continu this list but now is not the time to talk about success it is more import to find mean of escap a number of extrem negat trend that have occur the main one of them is the decreas amount of financ at the end of 1992 the amount of financ of scientif research of the academi came to r1 7 billion as compar with 1991 financ has increas by 87 fold moreov 24 3 percent of these asset r428 million were transfer to the academi onli on 25 decemb 1992 the amount of financ of clinic came to r3 001 000 000 alloc for the acquisit of equip and the capit repair of the build of clinic were envisag in the indic sum but 27 percent of the year asset were also transfer to the academi after 20 decemb how was it possibl in a week to spend these asset purpos and as a whole the increas of the amount of financ by the section scienc and clinic doe not offset the level of materi expenditur of municip servic which has increas by 15 to 30 fold and at clinic the level of the cost of foodstuff and medicin which has increas by 50 to 100 fold institut and organ have cut sharpli the purchas of equip and current outlay on scientif work and are not buy laboratori anim from nurseri which has led nurseri to the decreas of product volum as a result of which their financi posit is in a critic state the build of institut are fall to the ground sinc there are no asset for the perform of capit repair for prepar for oper under winter condit and for their mainten in proper condit an extrem serious situat has form at the clinic of scientif research institut the financi difficulti are be accompani by the lack of the necessari drug instrument equip and so on a signific amount of import equip is idl sinc there are no spare part for it and no reagent freeli convert currenc has not been allot to the russian academi of medic scienc for two year on 15 januari 1993 there were no control figur with respect to the budget for 1993 at the academi it is unknown whether fund will be alloc for the introduct as of 1 decemb 1992 of new salari in accord with the unifi wage scale financ for januari has been open in the amount of one third of the credit of the fourth quarter of 1992 it is natur that the financi crisi is advers affect the state of medic

train one for work abroad under long term contract is be note here a third of the scientif institut of the ram have complet reject intern cooper the other have drastic restrict it volum the reason

on detect of toxic to reproduct for medic product 1 introduct 11 purpos of the guidelin there is a consider overlap in the methodolog that could be use to test chemic and medicin product for potenti reproduct toxic as a first step to use this wider methodolog for effici test this guidelin attempt to consolid a strategi base on studi design current in use for test of medicin product it should encourag the full assess on the safeti of chemic on the develop of the offspr it is perceiv that test in which anim are treat dure defin stage of reproduct better reflect human exposur to medicin product and allow more specif identif of stage at risk while this approach may be use for most medicin long term exposur to low dose doe occur and may be repres better by a one or two generat studi approach the actual test strategi should be determin by anticip drug use especi in relat to reproduct the form of the substanc and rout s of administr intend for human and make use of ani exist data on toxic pharmacodynam kinet and similar to other compound in structur activ to employ this concept success flexibl is need note 1 no guidelin can provid suffici inform to cover all possibl case all person involv should be will to discuss and consid variat in test strategi accord to the state of the art and ethic standard in human and anim experiment area where more basic research would be use for optim of test design are male fertil assess and kinet and metabol in pregnant lactat anim 12 aim of studi the aim of reproduct toxic studi is to reveal ani effect of one or more activ substanc s on mammalian reproduct for this purpos both the investig and the interpret of the result should be relat to all other pharmacolog and toxicolog data avail to determin whether potenti reproduct risk to human are greater lesser or equal to those pose by other toxicolog manifest further repeat dose toxic studi can provid import inform regard potenti effect on reproduct particular male fertil to extrapol the result to human assess the relev data on like human exposur compar kinet and mechan of reproduct toxic may be help the combin of studi select should allow exposur of matur adult and all stage of develop from concept to sexual matur to allow detect of immedi and latent effect of exposur observ should be continu through one complet life cycl ie from concept in one generat through

guidelin address the design of studi primarili for detect of effect on reproduct when an effect is detect further studi to character fulli the natur of the respons have to be design on a case by case basi note 3 the rational for the set of studi chosen should be given and should includ an explan for the choic of dosag studi should be plan accord to the state of the art and take into account preexist knowledg of class relat effect on reproduct they should avoid suffer and should use the minimum number of anim necessari to achiev the overal object if a preliminari studi is perform the result should be consid and discuss in the overal evalu note 4 2 anim criteria the anim use should be well defin with respect to their health fertil fecund preval of abnorm embryofet death and the consist they display from studi to studi within and between studi anim should be of compar age weight and pariti at the start the easiest way to fulfil these criteria is to use anim that are young matur adult at the time of mate with the femal be virgin 21 select and number of speci studi should be conduct in mammalian speci it is general desir to use the same speci and strain as in other toxicolog studi reason for use rat as the predomin rodent speci are practic compar with other result obtain in this speci and the larg amount of background knowledg accumul in embryotox studi onli a second mammalian speci tradit has been requir the rabbit be the prefer choic as a nonrod reason for use rabbit in embryotox studi includ the extens background knowledg that has accumul as well as avail and practic where the rabbit is unsuit an altern nonrod or a second rodent speci may be accept and should be consid on a case by case basi note 5 22 other test system other test system are consid to be ani develop mammalian and nonmammalian cell system tissu organ or organ cultur develop independ in vitro or in vivo integr with whole anim studi either for prioriti select within homolog

process and the dynam interchang between the matern and the develop organ these system cannot provid assur of the absenc of effect nor provid perspect in respect of risk exposur in short there are no altern test system to whole anim current avail for reproduct toxic test with the aim set out in the introduct note 6 3 general recommend concern treatment 31 dosag select of dosag is one of the most critic issu in design of the reproduct toxic studi the choic of the high dose should be base on data from all avail studi pharmacolog acut and chronic toxic and kinet studi note 7 a repeat dose toxic studi of about 2 to 4 week durat provid a close approxim to the durat of treatment in segment design of reproduct studi when suffici inform is not avail preliminari studi are advis see note 4 have determin the high dosag lower dosag should be select in a descend sequenc the interv depend on kinet and other toxic factor whilst it is desir to be abl to determin a no observ advers effect level prioriti should be given to set dosag interv close enough to reveal ani dosag relat trend that may be present note 8 32 rout and frequenc of administr in general the rout or rout of administr should be similar to those intend for human usag one rout of substanc administr may be accept if it can be shown that a similar distribut kinet profil result from differ rout note 9 the usual frequenc of administr is onc daili but consider should be given to use either more frequent or less frequent administr take kinet variabl into account see also note 10 33 kinet it is prefer to have some inform on kinet befor initi reproduct studi sinc this may suggest the need to adjust choic of speci studi design and dose schedul at this time the inform need not be sophist nor deriv from pregnant or lactat anim at the time of studi evalu further inform on kinet in pregnant or lactat anim may be requir accord to the result obtain note 10 34 control group it is recommend that control anim be dose with the vehicl at the same rate as test group anim when the vehicl may caus effect or affect the action of the test substanc a second sham or untreat control group should be consid 4 propos studi design combin of studi all avail pharmacolog kinet and toxicolog data for the test compound and similar substanc should be consid in decid the most appropri strategi and choic of studi design it is anticip that initi prefer will be given to design that do not differ too radic from those of establish guidelin for medicin product the most probabl option for most medicin product the three studi design will usual be adequ other strategi combin of studi and studi design could be as valid or more valid as the most probabl option accord to circumst the key factor is that in total they leav no gap between stage and allow direct or indirect evalu of all stage of the reproduct process note 11 design should be justifi 41 the most probabl option the most probabl option can be equat to a combin of studi for

it possibl to conclud that the question is not onli preserv but also protect of ukrain gene pool appar it is necessari to have a thorough thought over and care work out program of scientif studi and practic action the main idea in develop a program to protect the gene pool of ukrain popul is the understand of it urgenc by a group of scientist and by the health ministri manag and take into account certain work perform in this area and the avail personnel and materi and technic potenti a group of scientist had been develop the program in the 1980s but it onli becam possibl to develop a complet

201 57 f 9 iv of this final rule clarifi how the agenc will determin that data from adequ and well control studi with adult subject can provid substanti evid of effect in the pediatr popul in summari this rule is intend to provid practition with more pediatr use inform in the label of human prescript drug product so that practition will have more reliabl inform upon which to base a decis to prescrib a drug for use in their pediatr patient the rule doe this by encourag manufactur to provid more inform on drug label upon which practition can base their decis the rule doe not howev limit the manner in which a practition may prescrib an approv drug ii highlight of the final rule the final rule revis the current pediatr use subsect of the profession label requir for prescript drug to

rule from prescript drug manufactur prescrib profession societi organ with special interest in the pediatr popul the lay public and other most support the propos label chang call it time and import an import step to facilit the inclus of inform about use of drug in children in the approv label a signific step toward the goal of includ infant and children in the drug approv process and a way to fill the gap of inform that current exist in the area of appropri drug usag in children one comment for exampl state that provid pediatr use inform in label will help health profession reach ration drug therapi decis for pediatr patient the comment ad ani inform that can be use by pharmacist to assur ration drug therapi in special popul will be a posit addit to drug inform such label will enhanc the likelihood of posit outcom in pediatr patient howev some comment were less support includ one that state while we commend the fda on it initi to improv inform avail to physician and their pediatr patient regard prescript drug use we remain concern that this approach will not measur assist physician most comment also rais specif issu for consider by the agenc these issu are describ below a definit of pediatr 1 sever comment suggest that age breakdown within the pediatr popul might be appropri the pediatr age rang begin at birth and may cover individu as old as 18 year to 21 year encompass the subspecialti of neonatolog and adolesc medicin one comment suggest that the rule defin pediatr as children under 12 year becaus it has been common accept that age 12 year to 18 year may be includ without previous clinic work in that age group the comment also suggest that the rule state the age group when pharmacokinet studi should be done in order to extrapol the result from infanc through adolesc or state whether the age rang will be broken into subgroup with test requir for each anoth comment said that a definit of pediatr would have to consid drug metabol pharmacokinet and interact with various organ and other bodi system the comment suggest that a system by which distinct class of drug are consid differ may be more logic and appropri anoth comment note that pediatr patient are not homogen and that age group show signific differ in function and physiolog function the comment suggest that inform from clinic studi be subdivid by age group and their respect respons to drug suggest age categori of prematur infant newborn children under 2 year of age children 2 year to 13 year and adolesc 13 year to 18 year anoth comment said that individu 16 year to 18 year of age pose particular problem and suggest consult with the american academi of pediatr committe on drug to consid defin age categori or group for pediatr label the pediatr use subsect of label is where inform about use of a drug in pediatr patient is locat and 201 57 f 9 describ in general term the kind of inform that should be includ the pediatr use subsect doe not attempt to resolv the mani difficult issu relat to use of drug in this popul what appear in this subsect eg age group cover will depend on the data avail and the abil to defin result for specif subgroup as a general matter howev the agenc offer the follow guidanc and use breakdown the follow age categori for the pediatr popul are common distinguish although the distinct are inevit arbitrari 1 birth up to 1 month neonat 2 1 month up to 2 year of age infant 3 2 year up to 12 year children and 4 12 year up to 16 year adolesc where possibl data should be analyz by these group but it should not usual be necessari to establish a drug product effect in each group it may on the other hand be import to have some pharmacokinet inform in each group especi the younger age group to guid dose and addit inform such as a specif studi in neonat to establish safeti although the agenc has determin that the term pediatr patient refer to individu from birth to 16 year of age the agenc recogn that for some drug adult studi may be applic to pediatr patient under the age of 16 year who have pass puberti inde a primari purpos of this rule is to allow pediatr label base on adult studi when appropri although in mani case addit pharmacokinet and safeti data may be need to support pediatr use statement in other case particular for pediatr patient in the 12 to 16 year age group there may be less addit data need b applic of the rule to biolog drug product 2 one comment said that it was unclear whether the rule appli to biolog drug product the rule as well as 201 57 in general appli to biolog drug product c pediatr studi 3 one comment note that about 80 percent of drug label current contain languag exclud use of the drug in pediatr patient or limit use onli to specif age group the comment ask fda to encourag sponsor to includ pediatr patient in their clinic studi when the drug is like to be effect for an indic in this popul as state in the preambl to the propos rule fda encourag sponsor to includ pediatr patient in their clinic studi and analyz investig new drug applic and new drug applic ndas to determin whether studi in this popul should be done befor the drug is approv 57 fr 47423 at 47424 under

effect for pediatr use the agenc is make it clear that label for pediatr use may sometim be base on adequ and well control studi in adult with addit pediatr data fda intend that this rule will call further attent to the need for creat and review data on pediatr use 4 one comment ask whether fda intend to requir a sponsor to submit inform for a specif pediatr indic or use if there are avail data suggest that such an indic or use would be permit under the regul the comment said that there may be good reason whi a sponsor might not wish to seek a pediatr indic or use for a drug even when avail evid would support such a use for exampl the drug benefit risk ratio in the pediatr popul might be differ from that in adult or there might be suffici and better altern therapi avail for the pediatr use addit the comment express concern that a drug that has been test in adult may not provid a suffici legal defens against a claim for injuri of a child the comment said that a sponsor should not be forc to assum or be place in the posit of have to defend such an action unless the sponsor believ the data in support of the pediatr use are suffici and that a sponsor should not be mandat or forc by the rule to seek a pediatr use if the sponsor for whatev reason doe not wish to do so anoth comment express concern that fda might delay approv of product that have good exist avail data for safeti

approv drug may be consid illeg market if adequ inform on safe and effect use in pediatr patient is not obtain and includ in the label the agenc thus expect sponsor to seek supplement claim for pediatr use that are support by adequ data this doe not impli howev that a sponsor should seek a claim for a pediatr use if the benefit of that use do not outweigh it risk the determin of whether to includ a pediatr use statement must be base on clinic data and other use inform not on a vagu concern about liabil 5 one comment said that although the desir to use potenti relev data in the pediatr use subsect of the label was understand such data should not take the place of adequ and well design control studi in the pediatr popul and that fda ultim may have to requir such studi the comment state that fda should requir manufactur to fund research project regard drug safeti and efficaci includ short term and long term side effect in pediatr patient fda agre that clinic studi regard a drug safeti and effect in pediatr patient are desir and the agenc encourag such studi in appropri case as discuss in comment 4 in section iii c of this document the agenc has the author to requir such studi under certain circumst in some case such studi may be requir prior to approv where pediatr use is import and where the adult and pediatr diseas cannot be consid suffici similar in other case the control trial in adult with pharmacokinet and other data as need may support valid pediatr label 6 one comment state that fda should consid other altern to the rule includ a formal review process that collect and analyz avail safeti and efficaci data on a drug use in the pediatr popul both befor and after market approv which through committe review could recommend further test of the drug after it is market if specif pediatr safeti or efficaci concern are found fda believ that the comment has misinterpret the purpos of the rule the rule describ the kind of data and inform that can be includ in

manufactur the comment ask what number of pediatr patient would be suffici to determin if there is a differ in age relat respons and how fda will determin that all avail inform about the pediatr use of all avail drug has been includ includ epidemiolog studi fda declin to accept the comment suggest the agenc believ that specifi an exact number of pediatr patient to be studi would be impract due to

comment suggest that drug current under develop or under review by fda should be given special consider to avoid delay in develop and approv associ with implement of the rule fda doe not expect delay

said that this had creat situat where prescrib are make decis on treatment modal without the benefit of time inform fda doe not believ that chang in regul are need to allow time updat of label under the current regul applic can propos chang in their approv label fda normal review supplement subject to prior approv in the order receiv effect supplement are rate as prioriti or standard and are subject to perform goal set in connect with the prescript drug user fee act of 1992 10 one comment said that the file and approv of pediatr label supplement from differ sponsor on differ timet could mean that some label for product consid to be substanti similar might be silent with regard to pediatr usag while other might be detail the comment suggest that fda and the american academi of pediatr

disadvantag relat to abbrevi new drug applic anda holder the comment state that the rule would give nda holder the burden and respons for pediatr studi and literatur search but not impos a similar burden and respons on anda holder fda disagre with the comment in part the rule is direct to anyon market a prescript drug and is intend to encourag the inclus of more complet inform about use of a

would discourag the prescrib of need medic fda believ that the comment misinterpret the propos rule and the purpos of pediatr use label the purpos of the rule is to encourag more pediatr use inform in

base on adult data of sudden cardiac death in pediatr patient use tricycl fda agre that extrapol from adult experi is inappropri and thus unaccept in some case extrapol is not necessari under the rule

addit postapprov pediatr studi fda believ that the comment suggest action beyond the scope of this rule fda encourag pediatr test and as discuss in comment 4 in section iii c of this document has the author to requir pediatr studi in some case fda will requir pediatr studi for approv or continu market this rule howev doe not add new requir for pediatr studi but rather describ the kind of data that

inform in their label which are wide use in pediatr patient and for which there is substanti publish literatur regard their pediatr use the comment note that propos 201 57 f 9 vi would impos on the sponsor the respons for provid inform that would promot the safe and effect use of prescript drug in pediatr patient and note that the sponsor may have complex reason for not necessarili want to includ pediatr inform in the label the comment recommend that the final rule includ a mechan that would allow summari inform from authorit publish literatur to be ad to the label of current market drug so this inform would be avail to the pediatr prescrib it suggest that the rule should provid an option permit recogn authorit medic expert or group of expert to provid inform to support pediatr

comment said that chang should be made base on studi report in peer review medic literatur rather than reli on submiss by the sponsor the comment state that this was necessari to make the label of certain drug particular anticanc agent conform to the current state of medic knowledg the comment note that fda restrict promot of off label use and third parti payer often take the posit that agent that have no label indic for treatment of cancer in pediatr patient are experiment and therefor nonreimburs even though they may be safe and effect the sponsor is primarili respons for bring forth evid to support label chang a third parti could howev provid evid to persuad the agenc to direct the sponsor to submit a label supplement a studi need not have been conduct by or on behalf of the

comment said that the data relat to the toxic of excipi includ preserv are inconclus make the requir inappropri the comment state that fda should encourag collect and analysi of data to enabl specif determin on the use of excipi and preserv anoth comment ask fda to clarifi whether the propos requir that label contain statement about excipi that present an increas risk of advers effect to the neonat or other pediatr subgroup was intend to reflect publish literatur or to be base on studi design to show whether an increas risk exist it ad that it was not clear how or by whom a determin of increas risk would be establish the comment suggest that the final rule state that a sponsor can reli on exist inform and is not requir to conduct addit studi the comment also suggest that if addit studi were necessari anim data be use rather than requir clinic studi in neonat it suggest that a standard list could be develop joint by industri and fda a third comment suggest that a requir that ani label identifi ani increas risk of toxic effect to neonat or other pediatr group should not be interpret as establish a requir that sponsor conduct toxicolog or other studi to identifi or quantifi such risk the comment also state that the preambl to the final regul should state whether the increas risk of toxic effect is limit to those establish by human data or experi or would also includ those base on anim or in vitro model a fourth comment note that anda holder may use excipi differ from those use by the refer list drug the comment suggest that anda holder should be requir to provid

govern bodi for track and field in the unit state american he say have been slow to accept the idea of sport as a legitim focus for research the soviet pioneer the field befor the 1952 olymp travel around the world to film outstand athlet and studi their train program then in 1952 instead of copi what they had seen they began design their own research the result were dramat appar in the 1972 summer olymp game when soviet athlet who just four year befor had won 29 gold medal to the unit state 45 came away with 50 gold medal best the american 33 equal strike was the improv of the east

basebal histori throw a ball and exact which muscl are use in pitch they can use that model to help treat pitcher who are injur or in pain by contrast hershis graph and those of other healthi pitcher with one produc when an injur pitcher throw they can pinpoint the site of an injuri by spot muscl that arent fire as a healthi muscl would this will allow them to spot an injuri long befor surgeri is necessari the no pain no gain maxim appli in the lab as well as in the gym befor the film is shot a lab technician use long hollow needl as thick as toothpick to inject fine nickel chromium wire into eight site in the pitcher shoulder at each site a 22 inch long wire is carri by the needl direct into the belli of the muscl as far as an inch deep there is a cot in a corner of the room for those who

allow you to go through the part of the movement quantifi it and provid ani analysi that might be help in strengthen and rehabilit the goal to be abl to give athlet a kind of instant replay analysi so that they can make immedi adjust in techniqu and train the dodger are use the result of the recent complet pitch studi to tailor injuri prevent condit program say bill buhler dodger head trainer ariel hope to give ad scope to movement analysi by use hologram three dimension laser imag sit in his offic he envis a scenario from the 1990s if i want to see carl lewi jump right on this tabl now use laser technolog i could push a button and he will jump i will look at it again and again i will stop him in the air then i will take my jumper and i will superimpos him and i will see where there is a differ ariel add that while his two holograph jumper are leap across a tabl top a comput will analyz inform such as the strength of each jumper takeoff leg how high each rais his arm and leg and how alter techniqu would chang the perform he may discov that if his jumper improv his leg strength by 10 he could outjump the champion combin with electr data on muscl function such 3 d analysi could take the guesswork out of train the chemistri of strength as ariel and his peer search for way to quantifi and perfect the movement of tomorrow high perform athlet biochemist are track the chemic mechan that underli strength and motion for some athlet the chemic key to improv perform has been anabol steroid but the ben johnson scandal which blew the lid off a system in which coach look the other way or help athlet break the law along with new evid of harm side effect cast some doubt on how long that will continu michael yessi an exercis physiologist and a professor of physic educ at cal state fullerton who edit and publish soviet sport review a quarter magazin that publish translat of soviet sport medicin say the soviet alreadi have reduc their use of steroid not becaus of drug test but becaus they have found that the drug caus injuri they found out that yes steroid are effect for get bigger and stronger muscl but the muscl grow so fast the ligament and tendon cant keep up with it he say the muscl stress connect tissu to the break point if you have a high level athlet you dont want to expos him to someth that could ruin his career veri quick yessi say for that reason it like that athlet of the futur will be seek strength on veri differ chemic pathway doctor at the usoc are particular interest in the question of how to fuel a super athlet we see nutrit as probabl the main area of perform enhanc say dr robert d voy former chief medic offic of the usoc although train tabl and special diet long have been part of mani american athlet regimen basic nutrit for the athlet is one of the least understood area of sport scienc we continu to use nutrit research that was done in the 40s say ann grandjean director of the intern center for sport nutrit at the univers of nebraska medic center and chief nutrit consult to the usoc that basic told us that if you have a person who is defici you can enhanc his perform through proper nutrit but onc the defici has been treat pump nutrient into an athlet wont boost perform and may actual be harm so instead of strive to find a singl superstar produc supplement research are concentr on the basic determin the precis nutrit need of individu athlet we know that iron say is veri import say tac brown who act as a sort of clearinghous for research that affect track and field athlet but what about trace element like copper and cadmium what role do they play what kind of defici occur as a result of athlet train at the beltsvill human nutrit research center in maryland helen n guttman associ director of research is overse experi to find out were work on project that have to do with athlet and stress she say one recent studi we did some experi in which we saw the effect of copper defici on heart diseas not enough copper in male would effect make the heart explod if it was under ani kind of stress that interest in itself but weve found that the relationship between two miner that athlet sometim take as supplement zinc and copper is critic pill pusher advis take zinc supplement but an excess of zinc interfer with the bodi util of copper and too littl copper ad to the stress of an athlet event could lead to danger even dead copper defici with such studi feed into the nutrit research base by 2000 it should be possibl to determin exact what each athlet need in relat to the workout he or she is do yessi say one can envis a small comput set up at the train site onc blood test have establish typic befor and after workout level of trace element and other factor such as hormon amino acid and white and red blood cell count deplet dure a typic workout the comput can calcul an athlet need and defici can be instant balanc ideal comput model will work from data base begun in infanc and will track the normal nutrient level in the healthi athlet bodi through his life guttman say she envis supplement that look more like food than pill a chromium fortifi appl for exampl to help ensur that what enter the mouth enter the metabol in a usabl form voy is certain that within the next decad advanc in nutrit will have convinc athlet that a peak perform in sport can be gotten without the use of drug and it will be a lot safer and a lot longer last those who cling to a relianc on illeg substanc as perform enhanc will be dissuad from use them voy predict becaus by the year 2000 i think we will have more sophist laboratori technolog than we have now and it will be veri easi for us to test athlet and control their use steroid may becom pass for anoth reason research are zero in on the chemic process that determin how much forc muscl can produc eventu they may be abl to creat steroidlik effect safe and legal with train alon the key to muscl build is a protein call myosin which affect the muscl abil to contract slowli or quick explain v reggi edgerton chairman of the ucla kinesiolog depart when a muscl has more of what is call slow myosin it burn it fuel slower and contract slowli this type of myosin is associ with muscl involv in endur event fast myosin creat power contract that result in explos movement need for a floor routin in gymnast or a 100 meter sprint current it is possibl to increas the amount of slow myosin through train but not the fast myosin gymnast it seem are born but long distanc cyclist can be made and research such as edgerton are tri to find out exact what activ is need to signal muscl cell to produc the kind of myosin that will enabl them to contract in way that will enhanc perform what we dont know is the specif chemic event that caus a gene to synthes a given protein edgerton say is it one type of exercis somehow the muscl activ has to trigger a chemic to send a messeng to the cell to have it creat the certain type of myosin there is some mechan chemic link if we knew what trigger certain type of myosin then we could design train program the genet of champion in nurseri of the next centuri a young athlet potenti may be clear long befor he can demonstr it by hurl a block across the room or master motor skill more quick than his peer the process of spot futur champion say claud bouchard an exercis physiologist and anthropolog geneticist at laval univers in quebec canada could begin with genet test at birth what we are do is tri to find the genet determin that allow someon to adapt well to exercis bouchard say we are not talk about select breed we are talk about identifi those who have the gene combin that show a gift athlet bouchard ground break research is focus on the gene associ with the transform of energi in the muscl particular the gene that are involv in replenish adenosin triphosph or atp this substanc is to the bodi what gasolin is to a car it the fuel that keep human run the more effect atp is replenish the more effici the human oper in his lab bouchard and other have train hundr of what he refer to as truli sedentari person his subject have never taken part in sport or fit activ in fact they rare attend physic educ class in school bouchard put these individu on a standard care monitor train program for sever week at the end of that time he measur their maximum oxygen uptak one way to determin how effici a person can replenish atp we have found peopl who did not improv at all zero gain after 15 to 20 week of train other would improv by 100 bouchard say bouchard and his team call the zero gain group non respond and the other high respond high respond are those veri few appar veri fortun who with exercis adapt veri well veri rapid and they adapt a lot these day bouchard is tri to discov the genet marker that make a person a high respond and he believ that in 20 year his team will have narrow it focus to 10 to 20 gene not bad he say consid that it take 50 000 gene to creat a human individu with these 10 to 20 gene have a much better chanc of becom good even great athlet bouchard say when you think about athlet perform if when you train you improv your initi maxim oxygen uptak by 70 or 80 it is go to have a lot to do with your interest in the sport and your desir to keep train chanc are the top athlet in the world are high respond he say it will be imposs for us to tell that somebodi will definit achiev the elit status but all the elit athlet will come from individu who have these characterist the applic of this research is far down the line he caution within 10 year we hope to have a batteri of gene probe that will identifi the gene associ with the gift athlet the probe are use to identifi but now onli for a limit number of gene the one that we know are use in certain movement with that research we can get the select children into earli train program i will not be involv with that but it will take the form of channel the motiv and the interest of the children so we have more chanc to succeed the power of the mind with advanc in biolog chemistri and technolog narrow the differ among the bodi of athlet increas attent is be focus on their mind there is a world of muscular talent out there say ron kendi a ucla sport psychologist but if the mental aspect is lack they dont perform to their highest level it come down to the mental tough look at all the peopl who dove against olymp gold medalist greg lougani they were the best diver in the world but he had not onli the physic but the mental wherewith to win over and over again even after a setback he has master the mental prepar he could see himself at everi phase of the dive from the takeoff to the splash the mental aspect is the cut edg sport psycholog has onli been around the unit state as a gradu ate level studi for about 15 year say dorothi harri a pioneer in the field she say research go on now will final convinc american coach that this field is import most of the research is be done on develop the abil to concentr more effect mental skill train say david yukelson a sport psychologist for the athlet depart at pennsylvania state univers and one of the few appli sport psychologist in the countri right now he say we can teach athlet how to refocus not so much how to mental prepar for competit but how to stay compos dure a game if a pitcher has just thrown a perfect sinker that was hit over the fenc for a grand slam he need to know how to let go of that his next pitch has to be as relax and focus that build and maintain the concentr skill research are also tri to understand visual in one studi olymp skier are connect to biofeedback equip and train to imagin travel over a cours they actual can get muscl activ as they take the cours in their head yukelson say eventu mind and muscl know exact what to expect at everi turn and when to use certain energi they can plug into automat pilot and move in the exact way we know will make them perform the best most intrigu yukelson say is psychobiolog the bodi mind connect it the thing we know the least about and that can be the most help he say if you look at champion in the olymp they report on be in a zone within a zone physiolog the muscl are relax and fluid mental they are in a high concentr state they are optimist they are in a cocoon but where are their brain wave at this state we are work with get an athlet into the alpha state we dont know what that can mean to athlet but that what research is for wed like to know more about the brain wave of an athlet and what get them to that state chemic and physic ideal sport psycholog will becom as much a part of coach as teach new play pattern harri say a sport psychologist time would be well spent work with coach who in turn could reach a lot more athlet put it all togeth devis the studi carri them out and analyz the data are just the first part of build the athlet of the futur even when scienc concentr on applic such as ariel hologram or map the electr fire of hershis muscl there has to be a way to make the leap from research result to competit result in this countri the liaison between scientist and athlet is first a coach and then possibl a team organ that also take it cue from a coach it a system that often creat standout athlet but it isnt a system that scientist think can creat cut edg perform with ani certainti or in ani quantiti or make the best use of their research coach are scare of scienc and most of them shi away from it they dont feel comfort with it and becaus of that they ignor what is go on in the lab say geneticist bouchard ariel and yessi as well as bouchard point to the fact that there are no standard requir for coach no assur that coach will even be margin awar of sport scienc more than 80 of the coach here have no train yessi say look at the coach in littl leagu and ayso it parent virtual anyon with enthusiasm can get some sort of coach job at the high school level the coach are english teacher and histori teacher who might have a littl background but who need some extra money colleg coach are also most former player but with no background in train and condit take former ucla basketbal coach john wooden what made him great he was abl to handl eight or 10 wild ego at one time he focus on psych the guy up for the big game and had them practic the best play over and over but it was all just base on his own experi on the pro level again mani coach come from the rank of former player it is a system sport scientist say that must be chang for my research to have ani kind of effect on the field of sport perform we are go to have to have almost a revolut in the peopl involv in the coach field bouchard say ariel agre coach cannot be just physic educ say the man who has work with us olymp coach of track and field handbal and volleybal they have to have knowledg of physic psycholog physiolog ariel see the comput as an antidot to the lack of scientif train coach he is begin to collect inform for his own sport data base and he envis extens comput file cram with the latest inform a coach will enter an athlet age weight bone densiti leg strength and recent sport perform and the comput will tell the coach how the athlet should train to maxim his or her potenti this train plan will be base on data from similar athlet around the world when scientist think about combin scienc and sport howev they think in grander term than simpli improv the knowledg of the coach they talk long of the system of the eastern bloc nation nutrit specialist grandjean rememb a convers with an eastern bloc coach he told me that the us has more inform more comput more scientist more research than they do in his countri what you do not have he said is a system to distribut that inform if i was told that my athlet had to eat pea to win they would be eat pea in three day yessi say his survey of soviet research show that much of what the current us research foreshadow is alreadi realiti in the soviet union the soviet and eastern bloc countri yessi say train their coach at govern sport institut with an emphasi on sport scienc coach work with elit soviet athlet must have been rank athlet themselv and have complet postgradu instruct in sport scienc mani top research are former athlet nutrit evalu includ frequent blood and urin test is as much a part of a soviet athlet routin as a warm up jog but most import accord to yessi the soviet begin their athletictrain process by evalu children psycholog and physic at a young age and enrol promis candid in state school where general educ is combin with athlet train and where sport scienc can be appli and further yessi point to recent paper publish in the soviet union about the use of high intens field current to measur muscl fatigu the studi was conduct on olymp athlet and hope the soviet system will allow ani applic glean from the studi to be easili dissemin in this countri not onli would athlet and coach be unlik to hear about the studi and it result but it also would be difficult to get athlet to interrupt their train to particip in this kind of experiment robert voy say what the soviet have that the american dont is the full attent of the athlet none of the scientist think the soviet system could or even should translat direct to the unit state where the tradit of individu effort is the norm but all would like to appli some of the soviet train techniqu gideon ariel is particip in a program start last year in israel that he think show the direct that would make us athlet most success ariel and a group of sport scientist hes chosen from a varieti of east bloc countri have identifi sport in which isra athlet can be world domin by 2000 one of those chosen was women field hockey ariel say today in israel young girl who have excel in sport such as volleybal are be test for the movement skill need for field hockey you begin with children who are 5 or 6 year old you dont just play field hockey you let them have gymnast swim resist weight train and hockey you teach them the mathemat of hockey stick move all their live they are learn everyth from the point of view of field hockey the team member will be well care for earn an educ and financi secur as repay for the sacrific requir to be abl to compet at the elit level we tri someth like that in colorado spring for mani year start in 1976 ariel say but it didnt work there was too much polit and the result of the olymp speak for themselv for someth like that to work here it would have to be organ tight the same way nasa would put someon on the moon yessi see at least an evolut and expans of privat run sport school in this countri note for exampl plan to build a larg sport train complex in orang counti in the next five year yessi predict that these institut will have individu from all area of sport scienc work with physic gift children and their coach children will combin their sport train with the rest of their educ as is done in the soviet union the institut will be expens and probabl elitist but could point the way to make advanc train more avail without such in at the ground floor program howev the trick to get the full attent of the athlet may be through money in 1981 the unit state began to open it nation team to sponsorship and to allow athlet to earn money place in a trust fund while they compet as amateur from individu endors and even prize money the leader in the process was the athlet congress the govern bodi of track and field event although he see an increas central in the unit state yessi believ that the way superstar are creat here will be much the same way they have alway been creat through the individu desir to win that will bring coach and athlet to scienc as it doe from time to time now in search of the better techniqu and the latest info and their success will in turn propel the unit state toward more and more central option that he see as necessari to high perform alreadi he say he is approach by parent ask him whether he can test their children to find out which sport is best for them and in one case yessi is work with a coach and an athlet tri to provid the sport scienc element in a train regimen he has work for five year with usc sophomor quarterback todd marinovich yessi met marinovich and his father former oakland raider player and los angel ram scout marv marinovich when todd was 13 they have work togeth sinc appli yessi knowledg of biomechan exercis physiolog and soviet sport research to todd train as a high school student at capistrano valley high school todd pass the footbal for 9 194 yard more than ani other high school quarterback in histori if he stay healthi and continu his march through the record book as a colleg quarterback yessi predict that there go to be greater interest from athlet coach and parent in what it take to build a talent like todd there are go to be coach come through like a marv marinovich who are go to be have outstand athlet other will ask where did they come from how come hes win and then they will say to themselv mayb i have someth to learn yessi say research jill gottesman also contribut to this report", "score":

and it is veri like that by the end of the 90s there will be some genet treatment gene therapi but that go to mean that the 90s will also be a time of greater concern about ethic not onli in genet therapi but also in the area of health care and what is appropri treatment it possibl genet therapi could be use in the treatment of cancer and aid but it wont start there it will start with a specif disord where there is a known singl genet defect one excit area is the expand knowledg of cancer through the genet regul of oncogen the gene identifi as caus cancer in human this is particular excit in offer a promis for prevent as well as treatment for cancer this includ a better understand of the way environment agent some of the toxin we are expos to alter genet regul and therefor predispos a

where everyon was talk about the war everyon was obsess with the war but no one had been to the war and didnt even know anyon who had been to the war and it gave me a certain amount of glamour and i was high on that then in rapid order herr lost three close photograph friend in vietnam larri burrow dana stone and sean flynn son of errol flynn even now more than 20 year later this is hard for herr

with hemingway but in my heart i think he was an extraordinari writer he say faulkner had greater rang and genius greater vision he was a greater writer but the thing that hemingway could do that no one els could do he make it happen sexual and that a kind of shamanist power everybodi tri to imit him he becam a kind of cartoon of himself he was mad he hit his head too mani time yet he alway had

chemic result in a high level of confid that the chemic caus an advers effect at relat low dose level epa believ that this evid is suffici for list the chemic under section 313 epa also believ that where a review of the scientif data indic that the chemic will caus various advers effect at moder dose level the total weight of the evid indic that there is suffici evid for list the chemic under

propos for list under epcra section 313 d 2 a ie base on advers acut human health effect and where appropri under section 313 d 2 c ie base on advers ecolog effect for chemic list under epcra section

in unit iv b of this preambl epa doe not believ that it is appropri to factor exposur into the list decis for the chemic be list pursuant to section 313 d 2 b in this rulemak follow a review and analysi of the inform avail about each chemic in this final rule includ inform provid through public comment by senior agenc scientist the agenc conclud that for each of the chemic list one or more of the epcra section 313 list criteria are met moreov the advers effect associ with each of the chemic be list today are serious and signific in some case the effect are extrem such as cancer or death in other the effect are serious and last includ for exampl impair of a fetus or an offspr physic develop neurolog effect inhibit motor abil or mental process or impair the abil to reproduc or the sustain of a fragil ecosystem such as an estuari for a number of chemic in the final rule there is more than one advers effect it is import to understand that although an advers effect is known or can be reason anticip to be caus by a chemic on the section 313 list a releas of a chemic into a communiti doe not necessarili mean that the effect will occur exposur and dose are also import factor in determin whether an advers effect occur and how serious the manifest will be the list of a chemic on the section 313 list doe not mean that a particular communiti will experi these advers effect instead the purpos for list a chemic is to ensur that the public get inform about releas of such chemic thus epa believ that for chemic that typic do not affect sole one or two speci but rather affect chang across a whole ecosystem and for which there is well document evid support the advers effect that their addit to the epcra section 313 list is warrant even though the sever of the advers effect that they induc will be depend upon site specif characterist onc epa make releas data avail through tri the communiti may then make it own determin on the import of these releas and their potenti advers effect the expans of the epcra section 313 toxic chemic list is the first phase of the expans of the tri program epa plan to issu a propos rule in earli 1995 expand the scope of industri sector that would be subject to epcra section 313 epa initi analysi for this effort is focus on industri sector which have activ relat to manufactur that result in signific releas of chemic list on epcra section 313 epa is also consid further expand right to know by investig the feasibl of ad data on exposur to and use of chemic at tri facil the agenc believ that the collect of this type of data would provid a greater understand of risk reduct and pollut prevent opportun in conjunct with these expans activ the agenc is also consid situat where data of lesser valu can be remov from the tri system elsewher in this issu of the feder regist epa is promulg a rule establish an altern threshold for facil with low annual report amount of list toxic chemic this altern threshold will provid consider relief for facil which generat small amount of epcra section 313 chemic in report amount this relief will offset the increas burden that this expans rule may impos the altern threshold for manufactur or process or otherwis use for each of the chemic meet the facil categori will be an amount greater than one million pound per year if a facil meet the altern threshold criteria that facil will not be requir to file a complet tri report form r but will be requir to submit an annual certif statement for each chemic meet these condit for the report year for which these condit were met and maintain record support calcul made to determin these condit epa estim that this altern threshold provid the option to convert approxim 20 100 form r report to certif statement iii summari of final rule in

fr 12866 a summari of the methodolog use to develop the list was provid monsanto believ that the use of an med of 500 mg kg day as the upper limit of the may be suffici categori of the screen criteria requir an unrealist high dose to have been use for toxic test epa agre that the upper bound for the medium prioriti categori may warrant reconsider epa will address this issu and other comment receiv on the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 11 when the agenc final that document howev none of the chemic propos for list in the propos rule had med that approach this upper bound of the chemic propos

fifth of the medium prioriti categori rang ie med onli slight greater than the high prioriti categori rang epa reiter that the med screen is not intend and is not use by epa as a surrog for the actual statutori list criteria addit to epcra section 313 are base on a hazard assess and where appropri an analysi of exposur to determin whether the chemic meet one or more of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria the natur resourc defens council support the health and environment effect screen criteria use by epa as a reason basi to screen chemic as candid for possibl addit to epcra section 313 the agenc agre with this comment in it support of the use of the screen criteria and believ that the screen criteria provid a reason basi to make a preliminari evalu of chemic for possibl addit to the epcra section 313 list epa also agre with the comment statement that the specif screen valu are consist with establish risk assess procedur appli in other epa program 2 screen base on product volum eastman chemic compani state that in addit to the use of a product volum screen the agenc should consid the number of tri form rs that would like be submit subsequ to list if the number is consid to be minim perhap 5 10 15 or more report then epa should balanc the public right to know with the econom burden place on an industri epa adopt a product volum screen for the develop of the propos rule to screen out those chemic for which no report are expect to be submit the agenc believ that it has the discret to not includ such chemic at this time if chemic that did not meet the product volum screen were list there would be an econom burden for firm that would have to determin that they did not exceed the report threshold without provid ani inform to the public while the agenc has determin to not list chemic for which no report would be submit epa believ that it is appropri to add chemic to epcra section 313 for which even a small number of report are like to be submit nation in such case the report facil will still provid import inform to the surround communiti even though a particular chemic may onli be manufactur process or otherwis use at a relat small number of facil the data provid in the tri form r report by these facil could repres signific inform in the communiti in which the facil are locat the agenc believ that it would be inconsist with the public right to know not to list chemic even if onli a low number of report is expect 3 use of the draft hazard assess guidelin six industri trade organ and three compani contend that epa use of the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 11 was inappropri the comment state that the use of the term draft guidelin indic that the document requir addit review therefor they believ that epa should refrain from use the document to support this rulemak it is appropri for epa to use the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 11 as it did in this rule in consid whether to list a chemic on the section 313 list the draft hazard assess guidelin are an embodi of intern epa practic that have been use in list determin that have evolv sinc the incept of the tri program the draft hazard assess guidelin do not constitut a set of rule for ad or delet chemic to or from the list the draft hazard assess guidelin are an explan of the process and general standard for evalu chemic against the epcra section 313 list criteria these draft hazard assess guidelin notwithstand epa has evalu everi chemic propos for addit direct against the epcra section 313 statutori criteria and has taken into consider comment submit by the public specif to those chemic respons to those chemic specif comment are found in the respons to comment document ref 14 summari of most signific chemic specif comment are found in unit iv f and iv g of this preambl b use of exposur assess one of the most signific issu rais by comment relat to the agenc consider of hazard exposur and risk in interpret the section 313 d 2 criteria specif a number of comment believ that epa interpret of the epcra section 313 d 2 b criterion chronic human health effect and the section 313 d 2 c criterion ecolog effect has been over restrict the comment contend that epa should conduct risk assess and make a formal determin that a chemic pose a risk ie a combin of exposur and hazard befor ad it to the epcra section 313 list the comment argu that the follow factor support their content 1 the statutori criteria includ an implicit exposur and thus risk compon 2 the legisl histori illustr congress intent that exposur consider were to be an integr part of determin whether a chemic should be list on the epcra section 313 list and 3 epa should consid exposur in conjunct with section 313 d 2 b chronic human health effect and for all list pursuant to section 313 d 2 c ecolog effect becaus there is preced for the use of exposur in previous list and delist action in light of the mani comment receiv on this issu epa has review it posit in this area and agre with mani of the comment that there are limit circumst under which it is appropri for epa to consid exposur factor for list decis under section 313 d 2 the agenc believ that exposur consider are appropri in make determin 1 under section 313 d 2 a 2 under section 313 d 2 b for chemic that exhibit low to moder low toxic base on a hazard assess ie those chemic for which the valu of list on the epcra section 313 list on hazard alon is margin and 3 under section 313 d 2 c for chemic that are low or moder ecotox but do not induc well document serious advers effect as describ below the agenc believ that exposur consider are not appropri in make determin 1 under section 313 d 2 b for chemic that exhibit moder high to high human toxic these term which do not direct correl to the numer screen valu reflect in the draft hazard assess guidelin are defin in unit ii base on a hazard assess and 2 under section 313 d 2 c for chemic that are high ecotox or induc well establish advers environment effect for chemic which induc well establish serious advers effect eg chlorofluorocarbon which caus stratospher ozon deplet epa believ that an exposur assess is unnecessari epa believ that these chemic typic do not affect sole one or two speci but rather caus chang across a whole ecosystem epa believ that these effect are suffici serious becaus of the scope of their impact and the well document evid support the advers effect epa howev disagre with those comment who suggest that epa must includ a risk assess compon to epcra section 313 determin specif epa doe not agre with the comment about the extent to which exposur must be consid in make determin under section 313 d 2 b and c this is primarili becaus epa doe not agre with the comment understand of epcra section 313 risk assess may be pertin and appropri for use under statut that control the manufactur use and or dispos of a chemic such as the clean air act or the toxic substanc control act howev epcra section 313 is an inform collect provis that is fundament differ from other environment statut that control or restrict chemic activ epcra section 313 charg epa with collect and dissemin inform on releas among other wast manag data so that communiti can estim local exposur and local risk risk which can be signific differ than those which would be assess use generic exposur consider the intent of epcra section 313 is to move the determin of what risk are accept from epa to the communiti in which the releas occur this basic local empower is a cornerston of the right to know program epcra section 313 establish an inform collect and dissemin program the burden it impos is signific less than the burden impos by a statut which control the manufactur use and or dispos of a chemic epcra section 313 requir that a facil use the best avail inform to prepar each chemic specif tri report howev the statut doe not requir that the facil conduct monitor or emiss measur to determin these quantiti a facil must onli estim to the best of it abil the quantit inform it report this is in contrast to other environment statut that may requir a facil to monitor releas chang it manufactur process instal specif wast treatment technolog or dispos of wast in a certain manner as such the agenc believ that the standard that must be met to requir inform submiss under epcra section 313 is less than that to regul a chemic under a statut such as the clean air act epa believ that it posit regard the use of hazard exposur and risk in list decis is consist with the purpos and legisl histori of epcra section 313 as illustr in the follow passag from the confer report the administr in determin to list a chemic under ani of the abov criteria may but is not requir to conduct new studi or risk assess or perform site specif analys to establish actual ambient concentr or to document advers effect at ani particular locat h rep 99 962 99th cong 2nd sess p 295 oct 3 1986 this passag indic congress did not intend to requir epa to conduct new studi such as exposur studi or perform risk assess and therefor did not consid these activ to be mandatori compon of all section 313 decis epa believ that this statement combin with the plain languag of the statutori criteria clear indic that congress intend that the decis of whether and how to consid exposur under epcra section 313 d 2 b and c should be left to the agenc discret epa has care consid when and how to use exposur to fulli implement the right to know provis of epcra the agenc believ that in this final rule epa has appropri use the discret provid to it to assur the addit of chemic that meet the right to know object of epcra section 313 while not unduli burden the regul communiti epcra section 313 specif requir that exposur be consid for list a

that are reason like to exist beyond facil site boundari epa has and will continu to look at exposur reason like to exist beyond facil site boundari when make a list determin pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 a the statut is silent on the issu of exposur consider for the section 313 d 2 b and c criteria the languag of section 313 doe not prohibit epa from consid exposur factor when make a find under either section 313 d 2 b or section 313 d 2 c howev the languag of section 313 d 2 b and c doe not requir the type of exposur assess and or risk assess argu by the comment epa believ that it has the discret under both section 313 d 2 b and section 313 d 2 c to consid where appropri those exposur factor that may call into question the valid of list of ani specif chemic on tri in exercis this discret epa consid it appropri to employ exposur consider to a limit extent in make determin under epcra section 313 d 2 c becaus this criterion requir the agenc to find a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgment of the administr to warrant report under epcra section 313 this languag recogn the possibl that under certain circumst a chemic that could theoret caus an advers effect on the environ is unlik to caus one of a magnitud suffici to warrant list moreov becaus of the limit on the number of chemic list pursuant to onli section 313 d 2 c that may be list epa believ that it is appropri to use both hazard and exposur factor as priorit consider in these list decis therefor to meet it oblig under section 313 d 2 c in case where a chemic is low or moder ecotox epa may look at certain exposur factor includ pollut control the volum and pattern of product use and releas environment fate as well as other chemic specif factor and the use of estim releas and model techniqu to determin if list is reason ie could the chemic ever be present at high enough concentr to caus a signific advers effect upon the environ to warrant list under section 313 d 2 c of the chemic be ad in today action pursuant to section 313 d 2 c all but one are high ecotox these high ecotox chemic are be ad to the epcra section 313 list pursuant to section 313 d 2 c base on their hazard the other chemic which is moder ecotox is be ad to the epcra section 313 list pursuant to section 313 d 2 c base on both it hazard and an exposur assess for this chemic for list determin made pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b in instanc where the hazard assess indic that the valu of list on epcra section 313 on hazard alon is margin ie a chemic is of low toxic and unrealist exposur would be necessari for it to pose a risk to communiti epa may use exposur consider in it list decis onli chemic for which the hazard assess indic moder high to high toxic are be ad in today action to the epcra section 313 list pursuant to section 313 d 2 b none of these chemic are chemic for which the consider of exposur factor would be appropri through this rulemak epa is clarifi it posit regard the use of hazard exposur and risk in list decis under epcra section 313 epa will consid exposur factor when make determin under section 313 d 2 a acut human toxic in addit epa has discret to consid exposur factor where appropri for determin under section 313 d 2 b chronic human toxic and c environment toxic and that there is a broader rang of circumst in which exposur will be consid under section 313 d 2 c than under b epa has review it past list decis in light of this clarif and believ that it prior list determin have been consist in the consider of exposur in 31 of the 32 list delist determin previous to this action includ a number of delet of low toxic chemic that congress place on the initi epcra section 313 list epa is current review the one except inorgan fluorid to determin if addit action is warrant epa will continu to evalu petit accord to this clarif and will delet chemic that do not meet the statutori criteria c addit of categori six industri trade organ 7 compani and the depart of energi contend that section 313 doe not provid epa the statutori author to list chemic categori some of the comment contend that the intent of congress was for epa to review individu chemic therefor the comment believ that epa should list all chemic individu general electr american iron and steel institut and eastman chemic compani further contend that base on legal preced cite afl cio vs osha 965 2d 9262 11th cir 1992 epa doe not have the author to list chemic categori or specif group of chemic epa believ that the statutori author to add a chemic to the list may be reason interpret to includ the author to list group or categori of chemic inde this interpret is support by the initi list of chemic and chemic categori adopt by congress in section 313 c in that initi list congress includ 20 chemic categori main metal compound but also categori of organ chemic such as chlorophenol noth in section 313 or it legisl histori indic or even suggest that congress intend to preclud epa from ad chemic categori to the list where the appropri find can be made where as with the categori be ad in this final rule epa determin that the primari purpos of tri provid inform to the communiti about the releas of chemic is most appropri serv by list a categori of chemic epa has the discret to list a categori rather than individu chemic of cours in ad a categori to the list epa must compli with the statutori criteria the agenc believ it satisfi the statutori criteria to add a categori to the list by identifi the toxic effect of concern for at least one member of the categori and then show whi that effect may reason be expect to be caus by all other member of the categori a specif justif for each of the categori includ in the final rule has been provid in the preambl of the januari 12 1994 propos rule in the docket support this rulemak and in the respons to comment document ref 14 sever comment rais polici concern and suggest that there would be regulatori difficulti associ with ad chemic categori these are address below one comment suggest that the regul communiti would face uncertainti in decid which chemic belong in the categori in this final rule epa has describ the categori in suffici detail to allevi uncertainti regard their membership of cours the agenc will work with the public and the regul communiti to develop as appropri ani interpret and guidanc the agenc determin are necessari to facilit accur report for these categori one comment question how to proper report a chemic which could be consid part of a categori and which is also specif individu list threshold determin should be made for the individu list chemic rather than for the categori the current epcra section 313 list contain some individu list chemic that also meet the definit of an epcra section 313 list categori for exampl pentachlorophenol is list individu on epcra section 313 but also meet the definit of the chlorophenol categori in these situat threshold determin should be made for the chemic as an individu entiti rather than as a member of the categori a facil would not count the quantiti manufactur process or otherwis use toward threshold determin for both the individu list and the categori list but rather onli toward the individu chemic threshold one comment contend that categori will lead to inadvert non complianc with report requir epa doe not believ that this is a signific concern becaus the categori be ad to the epcra section 313 list today each consist of chemic that are similar chemic and in effect epa believ that these categori will not be difficult for the public or industri to understand or for the agenc to administ in addit there are alreadi categori on the current list and epa has not experienc a signific problem of the sort suggest by the comment the congression object of provid inform is outweigh by ani possibl problem that some facil might have with inadvert noncompli one comment state that the use of categori will artifici lower the threshold for report chemic within the categori the agenc believ that calcul the threshold base on the categori ie a sum of the activ for each individu categori member is appropri and not artifici lower as describ abov categori are place on the epcra section 313 list where each of the member can be expect to caus similar effect becaus all member of the categori have a similar function group or exhibit a similar characterist for each of the categori ad in today rule epa believ that becaus each member of the categori has this similar function group or exhibit a similar characterist each member of the categori can be reason anticip to caus similar advers effect the member of the categori are not random select but are close relat and warrant be report as a categori these chemic in aggreg can reason be anticip to caus an aggreg impact of the advers effect associ with each member of the categori thus it is appropri to appli the report threshold to the categori regardless of whether the threshold amount is attribut to one member of the categori or to individu member in aggreg one comment believ that list broad categori where the individu member have divers properti and caus divers effect doe not constitut good scienc the agenc agre that a categori must be ration construct both in term of similar in the properti of the individu member and in term of their effect there is of cours no requir that the properti across categori member be absolut ident epa agre that the member of a categori be reason expect to elicit the same type of effect or relat effect in order for a categori to satisfi the statutori list criteria furthermor epa agre that determin to list a categori as with list an individu chemic are to be base on good scienc epa has appli these principl to the categori be ad in the final rule d polici issu there are sever polici issu which were consist rais in comment on specif chemic and general comment on the entir propos rule for purpos of this final rule epa address these issu in this unit of the preambl and not in unit iv f of the preambl in the respons to chemic specif comment detail respons to comment on specif individu chemic are avail in the respons to comment document ref 14 1 the addit of chemic that may be releas in small quantiti mani comment object to the addit of mani of the chemic to the epcra section 313 list becaus they do not believ that there will be signific releas of these chemic therefor they contend there will not be signific exposur to these chemic and the associ risk will be low epa believ that the chemic ad today meet the epcra section 313 d 2 criteria and should be includ on the epcra section 313 list the quantiti of a chemic releas is not part of the statutori criteria the purpos of epcra section 313 is to collect data on the quantiti releas so that local communiti can make their own determin about exposur congress intend epcra section 313 to address the lack of inform on toxic chemic in communiti by provid inform on releas of toxic chemic the public can then use this releas inform with site specif inform and the appropri attribut of a chemic to evalu exposur epa consid it inappropri under the right to know program to supplant the public power to make risk determin on a communiti level by the agenc use of specifi level of potenti releas exposur or risk as screen criteria to exclud chemic from the epcra section 313 list by list chemic that present a hazard and provid tri data on these chemic to the public epa allow the public to make the determin as to whether there is a risk in their communiti furthermor ani exposur assess conduct by epa would be conduct from a nation perspect and may not truli repres the risk to a specif communiti for a more detail discuss on the agenc use of exposur see unit iv b of this preambl 2 the addit of chemic that are regul by fda eli lili and compani nation agricultur chemic associ pharmeceut manufactur associ and hoffman la roch state that chemic which are regul by the fda should not be ad to epcra section 313 the comment argu that the fda approv a drug onli after extens test and a determin that the benefit to the patient outweigh the risk the comment further state that access to these drug is control becaus they can onli be obtain through a medic doctor epa agre that the drug test and approv process conduct by the fda is extens and necessari to protect the public health and well be howev as discuss abov the purpos of list these chemic under epcra section 313 is to provid inform on the releas transfer and wast manag activ occur in the communiti this is a differ function that address differ issu than those address by fda furthermor while the main use of these chemic is pharmaceut in natur that doe not mean that they are not a hazard in other context epa agre that in control situat eg a doctor prescript ingest of a drug is like to have certain intend benefit howev outsid of this control situat ani advers effect are not balanc by the benefit receiv from the use of the drug further epcra section 313 will collect inform on the releas and dispos of these chemic which is not cover by the regul of the use of a chemic as a drug 3 chemic regul under fifra sever comment do not support the addit of chemic regul under fifra to the epcra section 313 list of toxic chemic becaus they contend the major rout of exposur agricultur field use has been address through fifra regul which establish safeti factor and use direct allow for safe use they further contend that the use of these chemic has been determin not to present an unreason risk and therefor list pesticid under epcra section 313 is unnecessari fifra regul requir that the agenc determin that pesticid use of a chemic do not caus unreason advers effect on the environ which is defin in fifra section 2 bb as ani unreason risk to man or the environ take into account the econom social and environment cost and benefit of the use of pesticid 7 usc section 136 bb fifra is a regulatori statut and the impact of regul can be immedi and direct eg ban of a chemic and as such epa examin not onli the hazard present by the chemic but also the specif exposur scenario and weigh the risk against the benefit of the chemic the unreason advers effect determin under fifra is specif to the intent use of the chemic as a pesticid and doe not address other use or releas of the chemic that may result from manufactur process or other use furthermor a determin under fifra that the use of a chemic will not result in an unreason advers effect is not a determin that the chemic is not hazard or that the use of the chemic is without risk final epcra section 313 was not enact to serv the same purpos as fifra list on epcra section 313 provid communiti with some of the inform requir to determin what risk may result from the manufactur process and non pesticid use of a chemic inform not general provid through fifra 4 duplic report mani comment believ that list some of the chemic propos will result in duplic regul that will be unduli burdensom and of littl benefit one other comment westinghous electr corpor state that epa should util exist sourc of inform to avoid duplic report congress did not intend that the chemic list under epcra section 313 be limit to those that are not regul under other environment statut and for which no inform is collect pursuant to other requir the initi list of chemic that congress includ in section 313 consist of substanc regul under rcra cwa sdwa cercla fifra and caa further as repres edgar state in the hous of repres debat on the confer bill with respect to the content of the toxic releas form estim of releas into each environment medium must be provid this shall includ ani releas into the air water and land as well as releas from wast treatment and storag facil this shall includ all releas of toxic chemic into surfac water whether or not such releas are pursuant to the clean water act permit 132 cong rec h9561 octob 8 1986 epa believ that the chemic be ad today meet the toxic criteria of epcra section 313 d 2 and therefor should be ad to the epcra section 313 list epa further believ that the epcra section 313 requir do not duplic other regulatori program requir epcra was not enact to serv the same purpos as other regulatori program but to collect and dissemin inform to the public nor is epcra section 313 intend to regul how a chemic may be use the amount of chemic a facil manufactur process otherwis use and releas what media the chemic is releas to or how the chemic is dispos therefor tri as an inform collect and dissemin program is not design to direct impos control for the protect of human health or the environ in the same manner as other regulatori program the benefit of tri is that it empow the public through access to releas transfer and wast manag data on toxic chemic to make determin about risk in their communiti base on tri data site specif inform and the properti of the chemic e general technic comment 1 matern toxic a number of comment argu that for certain chemic in anim test the onli evid for development toxic occur at matern toxic dose that is dose that were high enough to induc toxic in the mother and therefor development toxic cannot be use as a basi for list these chemic under epcra section 313 epa disagre that fetal effect onli in the presenc of matern toxic demonstr that a given substanc doe not present a development hazard although the development effect may have been seen in the presenc of revers matern effect the development effect may be more perman and cannot be treat as onli secondari to revers matern toxic with regard to advers effect in the presenc of matern toxic epa believ that development effect at matern toxic are toxic manifest and as such are general consid a reason basi for agenc regul and or risk assess ref 6 this approach has particular relev in situat where revers matern toxic may occur in the presenc of irrevers advers fetal effect the agenc doe not distinguish between fetal effect observ in the presenc of matern toxic or those observ without concomit matern toxic both matern and fetal toxic are of concern to the agenc and are within the criteria of epcra section 313 d 2 thus epa will use the effect matern or fetal which is most sensit to set loael and no observ advers effect level noael if both occur at the same level the loael and noael for both are the same when the loael is the same for the adult and develop organ it may simpli indic that both are sensit to that dose level rather than that the development effect result onli from matern toxic moreov whether development effect are secondari to matern toxic or not the matern effect may be revers while effect on offspr may be perman there are sever agent known to produc advers development effect at minim toxic dose in adult human eg tobacco smoke alcohol isotretinoin 2 use of iri and other secondari sourc sever comment object to epa use of the agenc integr risk inform system iri data base the agenc offic of pesticid program 1988 tox one liner data base registri of toxic effect of chemic substanc rtec data base and the aquat inform retriev aquir data base the comment contend that in reli on these sourc the agenc ignor other pertin data that may be in it possess they contend that epa should have examin the primari sourc rather than reli on data base which are summari of studi specif some comment claim that there are mani studi in epa possess but not includ in the 1988 tox one liner data base that appear not to have been consid in the review process becaus they have not yet been review by epa offic of pesticid program the comment contend that relianc on iri or the 1988 tox one liner data base doe not constitut a detail analysi and care examin of the avail data on a chemic epa disagre with the comment epa use of the agenc iri data base for epcra section 313 purpos doe constitut a hazard evalu that data base general provid inform against which epa can evalu the section 313 d 2 criteria the inform contain in the iri data base repres the agenc weight of evid hazard assess for chemic contain in the data base the inform was develop after the agenc thorough scientif review of the avail data therefor by reli on inform in the iri data base in the review of chemic for list on epcra section 313 epa made statutori determin base on hazard assess conduct by the agenc although the 1988 tox one liner were use as part of the agenc evalu of the toxic of a candid chemic a number of other sourc were also use these includ decis document from a number of agenc and epa intern peer review group deliber of the fifra scientif advisori panel and refer to data evalu record for studi use in support of list therefor evalu of the toxic of individu chemic has been made on the entir data base and did not reli onli on the 1988 tox one liner data base furthermor inclus of all of the detail studi in the docket was not possibl becaus of the proprietari natur of some of the inform howev in case where relev inform was use in support of the list decis but was not includ in the 1988 tox one liner data base which is the most recent sanit version of the data base sanit version of the addit sourc were includ in the docket in those case where onli the 1988 tox one liner data base or other similar sourc were cite no addit data not describ in the 1988 tox one liner rtec or the aquir data base was consid to be relev to this list for a few chemic it has becom appar base on comment receiv that epa analysi did not includ studi which are in epa possess but which epa has not review the agenc is defer the final action on these chemic until such studi can be review 3 test at toxic dose a number of comment state that pesticid which are regist under fifra should not be list under epcra section 313 becaus the test conduct to obtain a pesticid registr under the fifra review process requir test at dose level virtual guarante to produc a toxicolog effect it is not epa posit that chemic regist as pesticid under fifra should be preclud from list simpli becaus these chemic were test at dose which are design to produc toxic effect the comment are correct that the fifra standard studi design attempt to set the dose at level which bracket the minim toxic dose and therefor the high dose s by design produc an effect the purpos of this studi design under fifra is to determin the potenti for toxic of the chemic whether the respons are dose relat and depend on the effect produc the degre of toxic becaus virtual ani chemic substanc can elicit a toxicolog respons at some dose level the mere presenc of the toxic respons is not use in isol in list decis under epcra section 313 rather it is the relat sever of the effect the presenc of a dose respons relationship and whether the effect is manifest at relat low dose which are consid in determin the hazard of the chemic and in make list determin

base on the toxic of the chemic itself further they contend that nowher in the legisl histori is there ani indic that post releas transform product degrad product or product of chemic reaction are legitim base for ad chemic to the epcra section 313 list the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria each state that epa may list a chemic that it determin caus or may reason be anticip to caus the relev advers human health or environment effect epa believ that this languag allow epa to consid the effect caus by the degrad product of a list chemic where it may reason be anticip base on avail data that the list chemic would readili degrad into anoth chemic that would caus the advers effect epa is act reason and within it grant of author in list the precursor to the toxic degrad product furthermor one could also view the effect caus by the degrad product as effect indirect caus by the list chemic epa believ it is within it author to consid both the direct and indirect advers human health and environment effect of a chemic in make a list determin base on the statutori languag and legisl histori epa interpret epcra section 313 d 2 to includ toxic effect indirect caus by a list chemic the statut and the legisl histori do not specif preclud epa from consid indirect effect in decid whether a chemic meet the toxic criteria under section 313 in the absenc of specif congression intent on the issu it is reason for epa to consid indirect effect in light of the broad statutori purpos to inform the public about releas of toxic chemic to the environ were epa to exclud indirect effect from consider it would ill serv the purpos of the statut by preclud public access to inform about chemic that albeit indirect caus a wide rang of advers health and environment effect there is preced for the agenc to consid the indirect toxic of a chemic be consid for list indirect toxic was the basi for the grant of two petit one to add seven chlorofluorocarbon and halon august 30 1990 55 fr 31594 and a second to add hydrochlorofluorocarbon to the epcra section 313 list decemb 1 1993 58 fr 64936 epa also use indirect toxic in support of it denial of petit to delet certain volatil organ chemic

dermal sever comment maintain that intraperiton intraven or subcutan inject inject into the abdomen a vein or under the skin respect has minim relev for evalu potenti human exposur from industri situat and should not be use to support an epcra section 313 list decis one comment contend that if consid at all intraperiton inject is a form of exposur that should be consid in establish a section 313 d 2 a find of acut effect not a section 313 d 2 b find of chronic effect epa disagre with the comment in make section 313 list decis the agenc cannot ignor the possibl signific of ani exist data includ data from intraperiton intraven or subcutan inject studi although it is prefer to have toxic data from the common rout of human exposur epa believ that for hazard assess under epcra section 313 the agenc should use all avail inform to identifi the hazard associ with a chemic this comment relat to five chemic bromacil lithium salt fluorouracil pentobarbit sodium tetracyclin hydrochlorid and sodium nitrit that are be ad to the section 313 list today for three of these chemic bromacil lithium salt fluorouracil and sodium nitrit ani data from intraperiton or other inject rout of exposur are supplement by data from other non inject exposur rout for exampl in addit to chronic dog and rat inject studi to support the chronic hematolog concern of sodium nitrit there are human oral data for bromacil lithium salt intraperiton inject studi in rat are supplement by gavag studi in mice to support the development concern for this chemic in addit to the development effect observ in the offspr of women receiv fluorouracil intraven development abnorm in mice rat and hamster receiv fluorouracil oral were use to support the development toxic find for both pentobarbit sodium and tetracyclin hydrochlorid the studi cite in the propos rule in support of the development effect of these chemic are either studi in which the chemic was administ via inject or studi in which the chemic was administ via anoth rout howev becaus both of these chemic are common administ oral and are efficaci by this rout oral there is reason to extrapol the effect observ in inject studi to effect by other rout the propos rule and the respons to comment document ref 14 contain inform on epa review of these chemic includ the toxic evalu this background inform will not be repeat here in the final rule base on epa reanalysi of the avail inform in the propos rule for these five chemic epa has suffici evid to determin that bromacil lithium salt fluorouracil pentobarbit sodium tetracyclin hydrochlorid and sodium nitrit have suffici evid to meet the statutori list criteria under epcra section 313 d 2 b 6 use of acut studi to support a chronic find sever comment object to the use of data from acut studi to support a find of chronic toxic the comment contend that there is no correl between transient acut impact and chronic toxic that is appropri to industri chemic as a whole the comment contend that if a chemic exhibit transient acut but not chronic effect it should not be list base on chronic toxic unless addit data on chronic effect are also use in the determin to list the chemic epa agre with the comment that if a chemic exhibit acut toxic effect it should be list base on acut effect unless addit data on advers effect after long term exposur are avail this comment relat to three of the chemic bromin 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol and sodium nitrit that are be ad to the section 313 list today for these chemic ani data from acut studi are supplement by chronic toxic inform in chronic toxic studi bromin produc upper respiratori irrit and neurolog symptom in chronic toxic studi 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol produc various effect includ lesion of the stomach mucosa ulcer rais area and excresc inflamm epitheli hyperplasia and hyperkeratosi and congest vessel of the mucosa of the gastrointestin gi tract sodium nitrit induc in a chronic studi in mice reduc motor activ

inform will not be repeat here in the final rule a summari of the respons to comment for these chemic is provid in unit iv f of this preambl 7 use of cholinesteras inhibit as a measur of neurotox sever comment express concern that the agenc has use a chemic effect of inhibit plasma red blood cell rbc or brain cholinesteras activ as a basi for list chemic on the epcra section 313 list these comment feel that this effect is not an adequ indic of neurotox the agenc believ that inhibit of plasma rbc or brain cholinesteras activ is an appropri indic to assess the toxic of potenti neurotoxic ref 7 in order for the normal activ of the nervous system to be alter by a toxic chemic the chemic must enter the bodi reach the tissu target site s and be maintain at a suffici concentr for a period of time in order for an advers effect to occur biochem chang preced the more overt physiolog chang associ with neurotox and are more easili detect acetylcholinesteras ach is the enzym that inactiv or termin the effect of the neurotransmitt acetylcholin on it target when this enzym is inhibit acetylcholin is built up in the bodi and may result in loss of appetit anxieti muscl twitch paralysi or other neurotox effect thus one can assess the sign and symptom of system poison by mani neurotoxin from their biochem mechan of action such as the inhibit of ach becaus of the sever of these effect epa take a cautious approach by use a measur of cholinesteras activ as an indic of neurotox the comment concern cholinesteras inhibit relat to six of the chemic that are be ad to the section 313 list today the propos rule and the respons to comment document ref 14 contain inform on epa review of these chemic includ the toxic evalu this background inform will not be repeat here base on comment receiv and epa reanalysi of the avail inform in the propos rule for these six chemic epa has suffici evid to determin that aceph cycloat diazinon ethyl dipropylthiocarbam pirimpho methyl and profenofo meet the statutori list criteria under epcra section 313 d 2 b base on avail neurotox data for these chemic 8 use of certain studi for hazard assess sever comment argu that epa should not use studi in support of list a chemic on the epcra section 313 list if these studi have been determin to be insuffici for use in risk assess under fifra or tsca for exampl the comment point to studi epa consid in this rulemak in conduct hazard assess even though the studi when submit for use under fifra or tsca were determin by epa to be of low confid epa believ it use of these studi for section 313 purpos is appropri the low confid determin under fifra or tsca appli to the use of the studi for purpos of risk assess associ with regul that impos control the data base for a chemic may be rate low confid becaus of shortcom such as lack of experiment detail although these studi may be of limit valu for purpos of risk assess in support of regulatori control when consid togeth they present a suffici weight of evid as to the hazard associ with the chemic as addit to epcra section 313 made pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b are not base on the kind of risk assess need for regulatori control epa believ that such studi can be use to support list 9 docket was incomplet for certain chemic sever comment contend that the docket inform support the list of certain chemic is incomplet other comment contend that overal the docket is too general and limit respons to comment about the evid provid in the docket for specif chemic are provid in the respons to comment document ref 14 in the public docket support this rulemak epa includ copi of epa support document ref 9 12 and 13 for the propos rule and copi of the main refer cite in those document the primari refer that are cite in these main refer document were not themselv includ howev these refer document are publish materi readili access and are in the public domain epa believ that the docket materi for both the propos and final rule contain the appropri inform to support the addit of these chemic to the epcra section 313 list and to have provid the public an adequ basi on which to comment on the propos rule f chemic specif comment for chemic that are be final in today action the agenc receiv comment on 110 of the 313 specif chemic includ in the propos rule this unit of the preambl summar the most signific of those comment and the agenc respons more detail respons are includ in the respons to comment document ref 14 neither this unit of the preambl nor the respons to comment document address comment specif to chemic that have been defer for final action these comment will be address in a separ rulemak specif to those chemic 1 abamectin one comment merck state that primat are less sensit to the acut effect of abamectin and it analog ivermectin than rodent the comment impli that becaus human are primat abamectin should be less toxic in human than in rodent the comment further contend that ivermectin and abamectin have been use safe in anim and human abamectin interfer with gamma aminobutyr acid gaba transmiss and as such produc neurotox clinic sign such as tremor ataxia convuls or coma that are more sever in rodent and dog than primat epa agre that the avail studi indic that the sensit as well as dose requir to produc neurotox effect vari from rodent to primat by a 20 fold factor howev abamectin was propos for addit to the epcra section 313 list base on development effect rather than neurotox there are no development studi with abamectin in primat therefor epa believ that the rodent studi cite in the propos rule provid suffici evid that abamectin can reason be anticip to caus development toxic in human when administ in therapeut dose the agenc doe not disput the anim and human safeti and efficaci of ivermectin and abamectin but the safeti of a 02 to 03 mg kg singl therapeut dose doe not diminish the find of the development reproduct neurotox chronic and carcinogen anim studi with abamectin which in some case demonstr serious compound relat effect at higher than therapeut dose in all speci test the same comment state that although the aquat toxic data cite for the propos list of abamectin under epcra section 313 are accur and valid it may be inappropri to list abamectin under epcra section 313 base on the environment fate of this chemic becaus of environment fate factor which were not present by epa in the propos rule epa agre with the comment that the aquat toxic valu present in the propos rule are accur and valid epa disagre that the environment fate of abamectin will negat the chemic ecolog toxic epa believ that the environment fate factor present by the comment may reduc but do not elimin the potenti for advers effect on aquat organ becaus the chemic is extrem acut toxic to aquat organ epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list abamectin on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail development toxic data and pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 c base on the avail ecotox data therefor epa is final the addit of abamectin on the epcra section 313 list 2 alachlor monsanto state that at the highest dose test in the chronic mous studi cite in the propos rule epa conclud there was an increas in lung tumor in femal monsanto believ that other regulatori agenc have disagre with this conclus the comment contend that these tumor occur spontan in mice with a fair high and variabl frequenc and a possibl slight increas in a common rodent tumor at the highest dose test doe not repres a risk to human receiv at most trace level exposur the agenc has conclud that there was statist signific increas the increas was greater than that which would be expect to occur spontan in lung tumor in femal cd 1 mice at 2 dose level which were relev to potenti carcinogen to human the comment provid no specif to support it content that other regulatori agenc have disagre with this conclus nor is the agenc awar of ani the comment further state that the support document for the health and ecolog toxic review of tri expans chemic ref 13 also incorrect list the dose level greater than 42 mg kg day produc tumor in rat in the 2 year rat feed studi cite in the propos rule the comment argu that signific increas in thyroid and stomach tumor were observ onli at 126 mg kg day the highest dose test this dose level also produc sever excess toxic thus the comment conclud that the dose respons curv for the stomach and thyroid tumor are except steep with increas incid observ onli at a dose which exceed the maximum toler dose mtd epa believ that the support document for the health and ecolog toxic review of tri expans chemic ref 13 correct state the toxic dose level in the 2 year rat feed studi as be greater than or equal to 42 mg kg day in this studi nasal tumor were signific increas at 42 mg kg day and abov and the stomach and thyroid follicular cell tumor at 126 mg kg day the agenc agre that the 126 mg kg day dose level probabl exceed the mtd howev upon reconsider of the carcinogen data the agenc determin that the mtd is between 42 mg kg day and 126 mg kg day although the mtd was exceed by the highest dose 126 mg kg day signific effect were seen at 42 mg kg day which doe not exceed the mtd therefor epa believ that the 2 year chronic dog studi cite in the propos rule is a valid measur of the oncogen potenti of alachlor the comment cite a chronic rat feed studi not cite by epa in the propos rule in which 5 to 6 month of alachlor administr follow by 19 month on control diet did not produc a signific increas in stomach or thyroid tumor in rat the comment believ that this inform is consist with the result of a studi not cite by epa in the propos rule in which a close structur chloroacetanilid analog of alachlor has been shown to be a promot but not an initi of stomach tumor the comment did not further identifi this studi although in the chronic rat feed studi refer to by monsanto the specif group which receiv alachlor in the diet for 5 to 6 month in this studi and then control diet as a recoveri period did not develop stomach or thyroid tumor the other group on studi which continu to receiv alachlor in the diet develop both stomach and thyroid tumor as well as nasal turbin tumor therefor the failur to develop stomach tumor after 5 to 6 month treatment reflect the time frame requir for tumor develop rather than indic a lack of carcinogen respons the comment also discuss the mechan of carcinogen for alachlor the comment state that the mechan is nongenotox and hormon mediat the comment argu that the mechan exhibit a threshold and that nasal turbin tumor in particular are not relev to human the agenc acknowledg the mechan of carcinogen may be hormon mediat howev the mechan doe not alter the fact that the tumor are relev to potenti carcinogenesi in man mechan of tumor develop relat to the appropri model by which cancer risk is calcul howev mechan has no impact on the determin of carcinogen hazard in determin cancer classif epa doe not assum that the specif type of tumor seen in anim will develop in human howev epa believ that the develop of tumor such as nasal turbin in anim demonstr the potenti for tumor develop in human the same comment state that two epidemiolog studi not cite by epa in the propos rule have been conduct on alachlor manufactur worker the comment contend that neither studi indic an increas in tumor in human due to exposur to alachlor the comment believ that these studi provid import addit evid indic that the tumor produc in rat by alachlor are not produc in human and should have been consid by the agenc epidemiolog studi are use by the agenc in the overal evalu of the carcinogen potenti of a chemic along with other evid howev the studi cite by the comment are base on a small sampl size studi of this type cannot verifi the level and durat of exposur and repres result from a heterogen popul in addit one of the two studi appar onli focus on tumor result in death of the studi subject and may reflect an under estim of tumor incid therefor in the face of evid of carcinogen in two adequ perform bioassay in two speci the epidemiolog data although pertin do not negat the import of the anim data in the studi reli upon in the propos rule epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list alachlor on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail carcinogen data for this chemic therefor epa is final the addit of alachlor on the epcra section 313 list 3 ametryn ciba geigi corpor object to list ametryn under epcra section 313 on the basi of liver effect state that hepatotox was observ onli at high dose level 100 and 500 mg kg day in subchron studi the agenc believ that the loel of 100 mg kg day is suffici low given the serious of the effect hepat toxic to justifi list on the epcra section 313 list thus epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list ametryn on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail hepatotox data for this chemic and pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 c base on the avail environment toxic data therefor epa is final the addit of ametryn on the epcra section 313 list 4 amitraz nor am chemic compani state that in the 2 year beagl dog feed studi cite in the propos rule contrari to epa conclus the onli effect seen in the high dose 10 mg kg day group were a small but insignific increas in blood glucos and in one anim slight hypothermia dure week 52 and 79 epa disagre with the comment epa has re evalu this studi and determin that in this studi amitraz induc signific chang in blood chemistri increas blood glucos hypothermia occur not onli at the time note by the comment but also on day 1 and 2 and in one dog 3 hour after dose which return to normal within 24 hour at the 10 mg kg day level the loel as note in the propos rule these find were support by similar result obtain in a 90 day feed studi in dog cite in the propos rule nor am disagre with the agenc conclus that the noael for fetotox was 5 mg kg day in the 3 generat rat reproduct studi cite in the propos rule the comment believ that while there was a slight decreas in the mean litter size at birth in the 20 mg kg day dose group and decreas pup viabil in the 5 and 20 mg kg day dose group post partum there was no direct evid of fetotox nor am state that the effect on litter size was onli signific in the third generat anim at 5 mg kg day and may have been due to an effect on lactat epa reanalysi of this data indic that there was a decreas in litter size and pup surviv at 5 mg kg day in all 3 generat and a slight reduct in pup weight in the f 1 and f 2 generat thus there was direct evid of fetotox the comment contend that the rabbit teratolog studi report by the agenc in the propos rule was consid by epa to be invalid ie signific flaw due to high abort rate in all group inadequ small group size and lack of assess of fetus the comment argu that the low incid of anomali upon which the noael of 1 mg kg day was base were within histor control rang and fail to show ani clear dose relat effect the comment claim that a subsequ studi not cite by epa in the propos rule reveal no effect on fetal morpholog at dose up to 12 mg kg day while matern toxic was found at 3 mg kg day and abov no noel could be establish the comment claim that this subsequ studi not cite by epa in the propos rule should have been consid by epa epa disagre the rabbit teratolog studi cite by epa in the propos rule was never declar by epa to be invalid ie serious flaw upon reanalysi of the rabbit teratolog studi epa determin that although this studi doe not fulli satisfi the guidelin for studi conduct under fifra it is suffici for the purpos of hazard assess with a noel and loel for matern and development toxic of 5 and 25 mg kg day respect as describ in the propos rule at 25 mg kg day the follow effect were seen decreas litter size and increas pre and post implant loss decreas matern bodi weight gain and increas abort the high abort rate is indic of matern toxic although the abort rate were higher than the control enough anim remain at sacrific to evalu the toxic potenti of this chemic and to support the find that amitraz can reason be anticip to caus development toxic the subsequ studi cite by the comment was also consid by epa this studi also doe not fulli satisfi the guidelin for studi conduct under fifra although the fetotox effect observ in the initi studi cite in the propos rule were not reproduc in the subsequ studi refer to by the comment and not cite in the propos rule this doe not invalid the result obtain in the initi studi both studi were consid by epa in determin the development toxic of amitraz epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list amitraz on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the chronic toxic and development toxic data for this chemic therefor epa is final the addit of amitraz on the epcra section 313 list 5 atrazin ciba geigi corpor object to the list of atrazin under epcra section 313 base on increas incid of mammari tumor in femal spragu dawley rat becaus the comment contend that this tumor type is not indic of potenti carcinogen in human the comment state that the effect is speci rat and strain spragu dawley specif further the comment state epidemiolog data from ciba geigi manufactur and use indic no evid of carcinogen in a human popul expos for up to 30 year ciba geigi did not provid epa with a copi of this studi but did discuss the result in their comment while epidemiolog data are consid in the weight of the evid for carcinogen the current classif is base upon a posit find in a well conduct anim studi as describ in the risk assess guidelin of 1986 ref 5 atrazin has been classifi as a categori c chemic by epa opp carcinogen peer review committe and the scientif advisori panel epa 1988 the use of mammari tumor data for hazard assess purpos even when onli one strain of test anim has been demonstr to be posit is consist with current agenc polici the agenc consid the cancer classif to be suffici basi for list of atrazin epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list atrazin on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail carcinogen data therefor epa is final the addit of atrazin on the epcra section 313 list 6 bendiocarb nor am chemic compani state that bendiocarb doe not meet the criteria of epcra section 313 d 2 c due to it environment fate the comment alleg that it has been shown not to accumul in soil water or plant and has a relat short half life a few day nor am chemic compani also contend that bendiocarb is rapid broken down by hydrolysi to a biolog inact product as a result the comment state that there is no clear evid of advers effect on the environ associ with bendiocarb epa disagre that the environment fate of bendiocarb will negat the chemic ecolog toxic epa believ that the environment fate factor present by the comment may reduc but do not elimin the potenti for advers effect on aquat organ and bird becaus the chemic induc environment toxic at low dose level thus epa believ that the chemic can reason be anticip to caus a signific advers effect on the environ epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list bendiocarb on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on neurolog toxic data for this chemic and pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 c base on the avail environment toxic data therefor epa is final the addit of bendiocarb on the epcra section 313 list 7 bifenthrin fmc corpor doe not support the addit of bifenthrin under epcra section 313 becaus epa overst the neurolog and development effect of bifenthrin the neurolog effect to which epa refer were tremor or twitch neurolog sign that did not persist for the entir durat of the studi epa agre with the comment regard the development toxic potenti or lack thereof but disagre with the comment regard the neurolog hazard in addit to the tremor or twitch effect cite by the comment more sever symptom includ clonic convuls and death occur in the studi refer to by the comment that are cite in the propos rule at dose level onli slight higher than those caus slight or occasion tremor and or twitch in a rat development toxic studi by gavag cite in the propos rule the matern loel base on tremor was 2 mg kg day the noel was 1 mg kg day the mtd of 2 mg kg day was establish on the basi of find in a rat pilot studi includ as part of the chronic rat studi cite in the propos rule in which there were 3 death out of 10 anim at 25 mg kg day with regard to the comment concern the transitori natur of the effect although they may be transitori in natur this doe not diminish the signific of the advers effect in particular neurotox effect lead to convuls may result in more perman under damag which is not revers upon cessat of immedi sign and symptom therefor the agenc conclud that the neurolog effect due to bifenthrin are of suffici serious to warrant list epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list bifenthrin on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail neurolog toxic data and pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 c base on the avail environment toxic data therefor epa is final the addit of bifenthrin on the epcra section 313 list 8 bromin great lake chemic corpor and albemarl corpor believ that bromin doe not meet the list criteria of epcra section 313 they contend that the agenc has fail to show that chronic exposur to bromin caus serious or irrevers effect they also contend that the time weight averag twa of 01 part per million ppm establish by the nation institut of occup safeti and health niosh will protect against the acut effect of exposur they believ therefor that the addit of bromin to the epcra section 313 list should not be final niosh establish the twa for bromin for acut effect howev the agenc is not list bromin on the epcra section 313 list on the basi of it acut effect but on the basi of the advers effect it induc after chronic exposur these effect includ function neurolog effect and abnorm in respiratori and endocrin system in human chronic exposur to bromin can caus sever irrit of the skin mucous membran and respiratori tract gastroenter and death this sever irrit which can lead to death through either or both respiratori or gastroenter irrit is the primari endpoint of concern although neurolog sign and symptom which includ dizzi headach and feel of oppress along with other function disturb of the central nervous system cns may also occur after exposur to bromin epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list bromin on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail chronic toxic data for this chemic therefor epa is final the addit of bromin on the epcra section 313 list 9 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol bronopol boot microcheck contend that 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol present onli a moder acut hazard but doe not present a chronic hazard therefor the comment conclud that the compound should not be list under epcra section 313 pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b although the agenc agre with the comment that 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol present a moder acut hazard epa doe not agre that the chemic is not a chronic toxic the effect note in both acut and chronic studi cite in the propos rule indic irrit due to exposur to the compound howev differ express of irrit are obtain depend upon the level of materi to which the test anim were expos and the durat of exposur in the acut studi cite in the propos rule the acut gastric effect were seen at relat high dose in the chronic studi cite in the propos rule the effect describ below were note follow repeat oral exposur to lower dose of 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol the noel for chronic oral exposur in rat was 10 mg kg day with effect includ lesion of the stomach mucosa ulcer rais area and excresc in a 13 week studi in rat cite in the propos rule effect includ inflamm epitheli hyperplasia and hyperkeratosi and congest vessel of the mucosa of the gi tract the chronic studi cite in the propos rule show that irrit was caus by a repeat number of low dose in these chronic studi multipl dose were requir befor irrit occur further the type of irrit caus by acut and chronic exposur are differ therefor the irrit due to chronic exposur to 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol is distinguish from that caus by acut exposur epa believ that the effect observ in the longer term studi are serious and potenti irrevers epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail chronic toxic data for this chemic therefor epa is final the list of 2 bromo 2 nitropropan 1 3 diol on the epcra section 313 list 10 carboxin zeneca incorpor and uniroy chemic oppos the list of carboxin the comment claim that the effect of renal toxic note by epa in the propos rule was seen onli in rat feed studi and not in a chronic dog feed studi thus they claim it appear to be a speci specif effect that may not be relev to man epa disagre with the conclus of the comment becaus direct human test is general unavail anim are common accept as surrog for toxic test to predict potenti hazard s to human except occur onli in a few rare case where effect have been determin to be speci specif eg a 2 m globulin it should be note that the actual number of speci test with carboxin is limit and therefor it is prematur to state that the renal toxic of carboxin is speci specif signific the comment did not provid ani addit evid to support their content that the renal toxic is speci specif epa use inform from the most sensit speci to evalu potenti human hazard s as a conserv assumpt epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for ad carboxin on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail renal toxic data for this chemic therefor epa is final the list of carboxin on the epcra section 313 list 11 1 3 chloroallyl 3 5 7 triaza 1 azoniaadamantan chlorid dow chemic compani note that in the dog studi cite in the propos rule the test materi was administ in gelatin capsul due to problem with palat they argu that this mode of administr is unusu and introduc the confound factor of what is in essenc a bolus administr given all at one time of the chemic and result in an artifici lower noel the agenc doe not agre that this mode of administr is unusu epa frequent review dog studi in which the test materi is administ by capsul in addit dog studi rare permit ad libitum feed as use in rat studi even when dietari incorpor is the mean of dose administr dog general receiv a measur amount of food that they rapid consum therefor bolus administr close approxim actual behavior in dog the concern that capsul administr produc an appar alter respons is not a confound factor in the studi cite in the propos rule and therefor the report noel doe not need to be rais as suggest by the comment the same comment contend that the effect use as a basi for list occur onli in dog and onli in a singl studi and therefor are not relev to human becaus direct human test is general unavail anim are common accept in the scientif and regulatori communiti as surrog for toxic test to predict potenti hazard to human except in a few rare case where effect have been determin to be speci specif eg a 2 m globulin in the interest of be protect epa use inform from the most sensit speci to evalu potenti human hazard in addit result demonstr in a singl well conduct studi are suffici and can serv as a basi for list on the section 313 list the same comment state that the loel in the studi was base upon a slight revers effect in the liver of a singl anim the studi the comment argu should have been consid in toto rather than reli on a singl effect the comment impli that epa should have set the loel at a higher dose the comment is incorrect the loel of 15 mg kg day is correct this loel was base upon oblit vascul and perivascul in one anim howev these effect are not common seen in dog yet in the studi cite in the propos rule they occur in seven of eight dog at 30 mg kg day the dose next highest to the loel epa consid the effect seen in this studi to be serious effect epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list 1 3 chloroallyl 3 5 7 triaza 1 azoniaadamantan chlorid on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail chronic toxic data for this chemic therefor epa is final the addit of 1 3 chloroallyl 3 5

expect to be found in the atmospher in appreci concentr the comment further state that epa estim condit in it exposur assess that great exceed actual condit base on these comment epa conduct revis exposur assess for each of the chlorosilan these revis support epa initi find that dimethyldichlorosilan methyltrichlorosilan and trimethylchlorosilan can reason be anticip to be present at facil boundari in concentr level that would caus a signific advers effect epa believ that the exposur assess were base on reason releas estim and reason worst case concentr model detail of this analysi are provid in the respons to comment document ref 14 thus epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid to list dimethyldichlorosilan methyltrichlorosilan and trimethylchlorosilan on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcrasect 313 d 2 a therefor epa is final the list for dimethyldichlorosilan methyltrichlorosilan and trimethylchlorosilan on the epcra section 313 list the revis exposur assess for dichloromethylphenylsilan trichloroethylsilan and trichlorophenylsilan howev indic that these chemic are not individu present at facil boundari in concentr level that would caus a signific advers effect howev two or more of these chemic are usual produc togeth and as a categori are reason anticip to be present at facil boundari in concentr level that would caus a signific advers effect therefor epa is defer the individu list of these three chemic for consider as a categori possibl to be ad at a later date 13 crotonaldehyd eastman chemic and monsanto believ that crotonaldehyd should not be ad to the epcra section 313 list becaus of inadequ data on human health furthermor they contend that crotonaldehyd doe not meet the criteria for list as a carcinogen as put forth in the risk assess guidelin for carcinogen risk ref 4 becaus it was test in a singl sex singl speci experi the comment further believ that epa statement that crotonaldehyd did not induc tumor at the high dose becaus at that high dose crotonaldehyd is cytotox is a content which is not support by scientif evid they believ that overal the weight of evid for carcinogen includ reactiv and mutagen is insuffici to support list epa agre that the human carcinogen data are inadequ but feel that the avail anim data are adequ to support a concern for carcinogen the agenc accept the singl sex singl speci test of crotonaldehyd as be suffici for list becaus these data are support by strong evid of mutagen in salmonella typhimurium a statist signific increas in the number of both benign and malign tumor in low dose anim and induc alter liver foci but not tumor format in the high dose group crotonaldehyd is known to be sever cytotox with the capac to induc cell death and alter cellular macromolecul it caus gross degener chromosom breakag and reciproc transloc in drosophila melanogast and gross degener and polyploidi in all stage of spermatogenesi in mous seminifer tubul thus show that is has ampl abil to interact with cellular dna and caus sever disrupt in chromosom structur and cellular integr it is logic to assum that if crotonaldehyd is capabl of such damag in the mammalian testi which is protect by the blood testi barrier it can also caus sever toxic and cell death in the liver which has no such protect from toxic agent absent evid to the contrari which the comment did not provid epa continu to believ that failur to observ tumor format is due to cell death befor tumor could develop base on these find the agenc believ that the weight of evid for crotonaldehyd is suffici for list epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list crotonaldehyd on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on avail carcinogen and mutagen data for this chemic therefor epa

the 997 ppm 438 mg kg day is within this categori in addit to the neurotox effect as cite in the propos rule cyclohexanol also induc renal hepat and myocardi effect at moder dose level for exampl inhal of 59 mg l of cyclohexanol induc degen chang in the liver and kidney of rabbit epa consid these effect to be serious in this case base on a weight of evid approach epa believ that cyclohexanol present a suffici hazard to warrant list under epcra section 313 even though the report valu for neurotox effect are in excess of the med place a chemic in the high prioriti group epa disagre that the concentr that led to reproduct impact in rat and gerbil 15 mg kg as describ in the propos rule are abov the med rang for high prioriti list epa reiter the overal reproduct toxic of this chemic base on a weight of evid support the addit of cyclohexanol to the epcra section 313 list the chemic test in the 2 generat reproduct studi submit to the agenc by the industri health foundat cite by the comment was cyclohexanon not cyclohexanol as claim by the comment epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list cyclohexanol pursuant to epcra section 313 pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the

epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail neurolog toxic data therefor epa is final the addit of cyhalothrin on the epcra section 313 list 17 desmedipham nor am chemic state that methemoglobin format which is cite by epa as the basi for list is an entir revers effect which occur onli after prolong and consist exposur therefor the comment conclud that this find by itself should not be use base on the 90 day dog studi cite in the propos rule epa consid 150 ppm to be a noael methemoglobin valu were onli minim higher than control level and were not associ with an increas in heinz bodi in the 1 year dog feed studi after 13 week treatment at 300 ppm methemoglobin was seen associ with histopatholog chang hemosiderin and hemopoiesi while methemoglobinemia may be a revers effect it is nevertheless a serious effect and in some case irrevers damag may occur as a result of methemoglobinemia methemoglobinemia interf with the oxygen capac of blood result in an undersuppli of oxygen to the tissu therefor methemoglobinemia is a toxic effect and not simpli an indic of exposur to desmedipham as conclud by the comment therefor epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list desmedipham

nitrilopropionamid dow chemic compani and rohm haa state that the corros and irrit of the 2 2 dibromo 3 nitrilopropionamid dbnpa solut to the esophagus pharynx trachea and lung led to develop of dyspnea in rat the comment impli that the dyspnea in rat should be discount becaus it was caus by the method of administr rather than the toxic of the chemic the agenc agre that the dyspnea observ in the 4 week and 13 week rat gavag studi cite in the propos rule may have been due to sever irrit of the trachea and lung from accident or incident deliveri of small amount of the dbnpa dose solut into the larynx pharynx trachea and or lung dure the procedur howev this suggest of possibl caus can be neither refut nor confirm base upon the avail data dyspnea is the basi for the loel in the studi one of the comment agre that dbnpa is corros particular to the eye and at the least is sever irrit to the respiratori tract this is consist with the effect observ in the two subject studi the agenc consid the find of dyspnea in the 4 and 13 week studi to be of suffici serious to warrant list on the epcra section 313 list epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list 2 2 dibromo 3 nitrilopropionamid

comment state the agenc should provid clarif concern mortal of the pup and the calcul of the actual test substanc intak at differ stage dure the in life phase dure develop in the 3 generat rat reproduct studi the comment is correct in state that the agenc er in interpret gavag dose as ppm in the rat teratolog studi howev epa still believ that the dose at which advers effect occur are suffici low and the advers effect report are of suffici serious to warrant list the development noel is 10 mg kg day and the loel is 32 mg kg day base on an increas incid of a number of variat and malform as describ in the propos rule while the matern effect on bodi weight and food consumpt at 32 mg kg day are transient and revers some of the development effect at this dose are irrevers in the 3 generat rat reproduct studi cite in the propos rule a decreas in pup born aliv in the f 1a reduc pup weight f 1a and 2a and general retard of physic develop f 1a and 2a was note in offspr at 100 ppm 5 mg kg day the comment consid the loel for this studi to be 67 mg kg day this dose result in decreas parent food consumpt and bodi weight and there were no post partum pup mortal addit there were no effect on fertil at the loel at ani time dure the three generat the comment further state that epa should consid the valid of the 30 day rat studi cite in the propos rule becaus heart kidney and adren weight were increas onli at dose with no histopatholog correl and were due to the pharmacodynam lipid metabol of the test materi by the liver the increas relat heart liver and kidney weight at 80 ppm 4 mg kg day in the 30 day rat feed studi is further substanti by a recent 90 day rat feed studi cite in the propos rule with a loel of 80 ppm and a noel of 20 ppm 1 mg kg day in the recent 90 day studi cite in the propos rule absolut and relat liver and kidney weight was increas in male and relat liver and kidney weight was increas in femal at 80 ppm these increas organ weight are evid of a compound relat effect the agenc interpret hoechst celanes own statement regard the 30 day rat feed studi that increas liver weight and centrilobular enlarg of hepat cell at dietari concentr of 80 ppm and higher as evid of toxic hoechst celanes also contend that the effect in the renal cortex observ in the 90 day dog studi cite in the propos rule at 250 ppm 15 and 13 4 mg kg day in male and femal respect did not occur at the highest concentr test in the 1 year dog studi 80 ppm 4 5mg kg day indic that the find in the 90 day studi was not test substanc relat epa believ that the effect occur in the renal cortex in the 90 day dog studi at 13 to 15 mg kg day may not have appear in the 1 year dog studi sinc the highest dose test was 4 5 mg kg day if higher dose were employ in the 1 year studi then renal effect could possibl have occur howev the result of the 1 year studi do not negat the 90 day result sinc the dose level use in the 90 day studi were so much higher hoechst celanes also state that the agenc use an invalid flaw reproduct toxic studi to support the list the comment indic that the studi was compromis by infect of the rat coloni with rcv sda virus they further state that anoth reproduct toxic studi which epa did not cite in the propos rule should have been evalu in which the fetotox noel was 30 mg kg day instead of greater than 5 mg kg day as in the origin studi the agenc doe not find the origin studi to be invalid the data were consid to be valid for regulatori purpos in addit the agenc found the fetotox noel in the studi refer to by the comment not cite by epa

epcra communiti by each individu chemic the comment contend that the categori would mislead the public as to the amount and type of toxic chemic to which communiti may be expos the comment contend that data collect in aggreg is confus and difficult to use or interpret comment state that ad a categori of diisocyan base upon the isocyan function is base on the chronic effect associ with exposur to a limit number of diisocyan and that this method unjustifi equat toxic across an entir class of chemic that have differ properti and effect comment state that diisocyan encompass a divers group of

serious and potenti irrevers effect the second studi is a 3 month feed studi in spragu dawley rat although this studi was not identifi in the propos rule the result of the studi were describ the system noel in this studi was 3 mg kg day and the loel was 15 mg kg day the effect seen includ increas in cardiomyopathi and decreas weight gain and food consumpt as note by the comment brain che depress in this studi in femal was slight and occur at 120 mg kg day and taken by itself is not suffici for list howev when consid with other effect in a weight of evid approach this endpoint is support of list the comment further state that the 2 year dietari rat studi is old and has been supersed by anoth studi ref 8 in which the noel was 25 mg kg day the agenc agre with the comment comment regard the replac of the older studi with a newer studi but disagre with the comment noel the agenc noel for this studi is 5 mg kg day and not 25 mg kg day howev the result of the older studi demonstr that heart effect of eptc are seen in more than one studi the comment further state that in the 2 generat rat reproduct studi cardiomyopathi was observ onli in the f 1a femal and was incident to treatment epa disagre with this content the investig did not look for this effect in other generat thus there is no reason to conclud that this effect was not manifest in other generat in addit this type of advers effect has been seen in other studi such as the 2 year rat studi and the 3 month rat studi discuss abov and cite in the propos rule the agenc believ that the cardiopath find at 10 mg kg day degen cardiomyopathi is the pivot find of toxicolog signific for eptc epa believ that this is a serious effect therefor this effect cannot be consid incident to treatment the comment further state that the neurolog effect seen in the studi are not relev to the epcra section 313 due to prolong exposur and the cardiovascular observ occur at the highest dose test in the studi cite the cardiovascular effect occur after relat short exposur at dose of 9 mg kg day in male rat and 18 mg kg day in femal rat these dose level are suffici low and the advers effect are serious and potenti irrevers the agenc consid the neurotox due to prolong exposur to be relev for purpos of list on the epcra section 313 list releas of chemic that induc advers effect after prolong exposur is among the type of inform that congress intend tri to includ epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list eptc on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail neurolog

that liver and kidney were not the target organ in dog effect were confin to reduc bodi weight gain at the highest concentr 75 ppm epa disagre with the comment the dietari level of fenoxaprop ethyl in the studi compar by the comment were 0 16 80 and 400 ppm and 0 3 15 and 75 ppm for the 3 month and 24 month studi respect both studi are cite in the propos rule the microscop find in the 3 month studi indic that there was a dose respons for chronic interstiti nephriti with inflammatori chang in the medulla and inner cortex one half of the dog were affect at 400 ppm which is much higher than the highest dietari level in the 24 month studi 75 ppm therefor the inflammatori chang in the kidney of treat dog at 80 and 400 ppm in the 3 month studi appear to be relat to the ingest of fenoxaprop ethyl and therefor the kidney appear to be a target organ the agenc did not cite liver effect in dog as a basi for list epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list fenoxaprop ethyl on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail renal and development toxic data for this chemic and pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 c base on the avail environment toxic data

becaus they believ that the advers hepat effect observ in mice and rat 3 month dietari studi and 2 year oncogen studi both cite in the propos rule are not suffici serious to support list they note that no evid of neoplast lesion was report in the chronic studi they further state that delay pinna unfold in the reproduct toxic studi in rat cite in the propos rule is a reflect of slower growth onli and therefor should not be use to support list the agenc disagre that the evid doe not support a find that section 313 d 2 b are satisfi the effect in the chronic studi includ focal necrosi chang which are consid by the agenc to be serious and potenti irrevers in natur the liver effect in the subchron studi demonstr the progress of chang lead to necrosi in the chronic studi the agenc consid these to be serious advers effect the development effect slight delay in pinna unfold were said by the comment not to reflect development effect sinc develop was complet and function appar unaffect and that these effect were consid a reflect of slower growth reduc bodi weight as were the differ in relat organ weight the agenc consid reduc rat pup bodi weight and slower growth with result differ in organ weight to be effect that are indic of potenti hazard the agenc development risk assess guidelin ref 6 state a chang in offspr bodi weight is a sensit indic of development toxic in part becaus it is a continu variabl in some case offspr weight reduct may be the onli indic of development toxic while there is alway a question as to whether weight reduct is a perman or transitori effect littl is known about the long term consequ of short term fetal or neonat weight chang therefor when signific weight reduct effect are note they are use as a basi to establish the noael epa therefor consid

on the iri summari previous prepar for n hexan comment state that epa should have evalu the merit and conclus of each studi separ the iri data base that epa cite in support of the list of n hexan repres the agenc weight of evid hazard determin for chemic contain in the data base the inform contain in the iri data base was develop after the agenc thorough review of the avail data on n hexan therefor by reli on the iri data base epa did not fail to perform a detail hazard evalu of n hexan as requir by the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 11 the same comment state that base on epa screen criteria includ in the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 11 if a substanc produc neurotox effect at dose that are greater than 500 mg kg day ie if the lowest observ advers effect level is 500 mg kg day then the substanc would be place in the insuffici for list categori comment went on to state that most of the studi that epa cite in support of the list of n hexan indic that n hexan produc neurotox effect onli at veri high dose level and in mani case signific effect are onli seen at dose that exceed 500 mg kg day epa believ that the comment have misinterpret the screen criteria contain in the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 11 the criteria are base on the med level which are not loael these med valu are deriv from the loael and therefor the direct comparison of the screen criteria with loael is inappropri howev epa note that signific effect from n hexan are seen in quantiti signific less than 500 mg kg day for exampl a loael of 204 mg m 3 58 ppm loael adj of 73 mg m 3 was establish for certain electrophysiolog alter in human these comment made numer specif comment concern the adequaci of the studi summar in iri use to support a chronic neurotox find for n hexan comment state that n hexan is onli toxic at veri high level if at all and that the data are not suffici to support list under epcra section 313 the comment state that epa fail to show how the data contain in the support document for the addit of chemic from section 112 b of the clean air act amend and chlorin paraffin to epcra section 313 ref 12 and the iri data base compar with the criteria for ad substanc to the epcra section 313 list and how the agenc evalu these studi in light of such criteria in the respons to comment document ref 14 epa has address the specif comment concern the adequaci of the studi use to support a chronic neurotox find for n hexan epa agre with the comment that some of the studi includ in the data base for n hexan have limit howev the review of the comment and data have not chang epa posit that the weight of evid support a find of chronic neurotox for n hexan the weight of evid determin contain in the agenc iri data base is the basi for determin that n hexan can reason be anticip to caus neurotox in human epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list n hexan on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail neurotox data

should clarifi that isom of n hexan are not includ in the addit of n hexan epa note that the list of n hexan is for the straight chain ie n isom of hexan onli as the chemic name and cas number indic epa doe not believ that ani special qualifi is need to make the distinct between n hexan and other isom of hexan that are not includ in this list 30 3 iodo 2 propynyl butylcarbam troy corpor disagre with the agenc conclus that no noel was achiev in the rat chronic toxic carcinogen studi cite in the propos rule the comment state that the non neoplast chang observ at the 40 mg kg day and 80 mg kg day dose level while also present at the 20 mg kg day dose level lowest dose test were not statist signific and therefor a noel was clear establish at this dose the comment also contend that non neoplast lesion of the stomach in rat are not relev to human the agenc agre with the comment that the increas in nonneoplast chang report at 20 mg kg day were not statist signific howev the lack of a studi noel was base upon decreas bodi weight gain in male at 20 mg kg day the lowest dose test not the nonneoplast lesion the non neoplast lesion report at 40 and 80 mg kg day are still consid serious enough to support a list on the epcra section 313 list the same comment state that the simpl find of increas liver to bodi weight ratio found in the subchron oral toxic studi in rat cite in the propos rule as well as the incid of non neoplast stomach irrit found in the chronic toxic carcinogen studi cite in the propos rule in rat is not of suffici serious to warrant epcra section 313 list the comment claim that neither studi cite demonstr a suffici known or reason anticip advers health effect in human to warrant section 313 list epa disagre the comment provid no basi for the content that the nonneoplast lesion of the stomach in rat are not relev to human the incid of these lesion was dose depend and was appar at both sacrific moreov incid increas with durat of treatment the agenc consid this effect to be serious in natur and not readili revers and therefor the chemic warrant list the liver to bodi weight ratio from the subchron studi is not in itself suffici to warrant list on

the comment feel that there is no basi for the list of lithium carbon on the epcra section 313 list the agenc is not propos to list lithium carbon on the basi of acut effect but on the basi of development effect therefor the agenc doe not need to determin that lithium carbon is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus signific advers acut human health effect at concentr level that are reason like to exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas but rather must satisfi the section 313 d 2 b criteria as the comment note lithium carbon is a well known development toxic in both anim and human at therapeut level and can caus life threaten cardiac abnorm in the develop human fetus the comment argu that lithium is toxic at therapeut level but not at natur occur level the agenc agre that lithium may be toxic at therapeut level but also recogn that use of lithium in a therapeut set is care control level observ in a therapeut set may have littl or no relationship to level seen in an uncontrol releas set furthermor both the efficaci of lithium and it associ toxic in human is depend upon individu sensit and can vari wide from individu to

generat rat reproduct studi and an independ review have reach similar conclus in review the materi submit by the comment epa fail to find a statement from the author that the studi was flaw the review of the 2 generat rat reproduct studi by an independ review did not find fault with the entir studi but state that it should not be use for risk assess purpos epa agre with this judgement but is not use this studi for risk assess purpos but rather as an indic of human health hazard the agenc believ that the advers effect seen in these studi are of suffici serious to warrant list under epcra section 313 d 2 b nmp produc group also state that when the 2 generat reproduct studi is evalu take into account the genet fertil problem in the strain of male rat the studi establish a noael of 160 mg kg rather than the noael of 50 mg kg cite in the propos rule the comment also believ the studi should not be consid becaus the variabl in male fertil was not dose depend epa doe not agre that the noael should be adjust for the fertil problem of the strain of male rat use in the studi dure the first mate on which epa base it concern level f 2a the high dose male group exhibit a 24 percent reduct in the mate index in addit there was a statist signific dose relat reduct in the male fertil index thus the index was 93 1 72 4 72 4 and 46 7 in the control low mid and high dose group respect the control valu in this studi is 93 1 percent well within accept limit for ani reproduct effect studi and as seen the reduct in mate index is dose relat be 72 4 percent in the low and mid dose group and 46 7 percent in the high dose group with a control valu of 93 1 percent and use the concurr control as an index of mate perform for the male in this studi the agenc feel that there is no reason to adjust the noael of 50 mg kg to account for reduc fertil in the test anim dure the second mate f 2b the male high dose group exhibit a 31 percent reduct in the mate index and again there was a statist signific dose relat reduct in the male fertil index 83 3 69 0 60 0 and 34 5 in the control low mid and high dose group respect the femal high dose group exhibit a 28 percent reduct in the fertil index and again there was a statist signific dose relat reduct in the fecund index 92 6 74 1 64 3 and 50 0 in the control low mid and high dose group respect again the agenc doe not feel that a control valu of 83 3 percent fertil index in the control anim is abnorm and is more concern with the dose relat decreas in fertil as an indic that nmp is a reproduct toxic epa is also concern with the decreas in fecund index in the femal and doe not feel that the control valu of 92 6 percent warrant ani adjust of noael for reduc fertil or mate abil among male in the studi the agenc also disagre with nmp produc group content that decreas in male fertil observ are not dose depend the data present abov clear show a correl between dose and decreas fertil nmp produc group claim that the effect of nmp administr manifest onli in the second generat of anim epa disagre and believ that effect were manifest in the first generat there was a reduct in fertil in the f1 generat histolog evid of reproduct effect includ hypospermia and signific system toxic in the f1 generat in addit epa doe not believ that it is unusu to see increas sever in the second generat sinc anim have either been treat for 2 generat or are the offspr of treat anim and cumul effect or effect on the reproduct system of the first generat anim may manifest in the second generat nmp produc group further believ that nmp is not a development hazard becaus epa conclus is base on observ from what the comment claim is a flaw reproduct studi the comment add that a consider bodi of evid support the conclus that nmp is not uniqu toxic to a develop fetus epa conclus about the development toxic of nmp are base upon a rabbit gavag studi and the development portion of the 2 generat reproduct studi refer to abov and cite in the propos rule the rabbit gavag studi show a signific increas in resorpt and malform misshapen skull bone and cardiovascular malform the loael for development toxic in this studi was 540 mg kg and the noael was 175 mg kg the development portion of the 2 generat reproduct effect studi show evid of development toxic in both generat after exposur to 500 mg kg as demonstr by reduc litter size reduc postnat surviv and reduc pup bodi weight the agenc believ that despit the flaw in the studi the data describ abov clear show evid of development toxic in addit epa believ that the bodi of evid support the find that nmp is uniqu toxic to the develop fetus and the inform avail to the agenc both from the rat development studi and rabbit gavag studi is suffici to list nmp on the epcra section 313 list epa reaffirm that there is suffici evid to list n methyl 2 pyrrolidon under epcra section 313 pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on avail development and reproduct toxic data for this chemic

noel for this studi was 35 mg kg day the noel for development toxic was 22 mg kg day base on an increas in runt at the next highest dose 35 and 140 mg kg day the other advers effect list in the comment for this studi occur onli at the highest dose test 140 mg kg day the noel for matern toxic was 35 mg kg day and that the effect on the pup runt occur at a dose level lower than the dose level found to be matern toxic the same comment state that the issu of whether molin is a reproduct toxin on the basi of it advers effect on fertil in rodent has been veri extens investig with studi in rabbit dog monkey and man and these studi have shown conclus that the effect seen in rodent is sic not relev to man while epa agre that there has been extens test of molin with respect to fertil the data on the rabbit and dog do not support the comment content that the effect seen in rodent are specif onli to rodent for exampl in each of the fertil studi in rabbit both an increas in pre implant loss and abnorm sperm were observ these two consist reproduc observ are suggest of fertil effect are two of the same observ found in rat and although not as dramat as observ in rat cannot be negat in the chronic dog studi lesion in male reproduct organ and effect on sperm were observ which demonstr that at least in the male the gonad are target organ for molin the lack of ani effect on the limit paramet assess in the male monkey studi lend littl credenc to the argument sinc onli male monkey were expos to molin and no reproduct studi have been perform to assess reproduct perform sinc molin is

categori as name becaus the name chlorin paraffin identifi a particular feedstock use to make this class of compound howev as discuss below epa believ that the chlorin of paraffin and a olefin result in product that do not differ signific structur physic or toxicolog epa believ that rather than name the categori base on one of the feedstock use to make these compound a more appropri name for the categori is one that describ the actual member of the categori therefor becaus the member of this categori are alkan contain three or more chlorin epa is renam this categori polychlorin alkan the new

some of the comment contend that onli the data on short chain chlorin paraffin are suffici to justifi a list on the epcra section 313 list and that epa should limit the categori to just the short chain speci a long chain chlorin paraffin iarc has not classifi the long chain chlorin paraffin becaus there is insuffici evid that they caus cancer in treat anim the ntp found no evid of cancer in male rat treat with 1 875 or 3 750 mg kg day for 24 month with long chain chlorin paraffin femal rat treat with 900 mg kg day show margin increas in adren gland tumor femal rat treat with 5 000 mg kg day had margin increas in liver tumor the onli signific increas in tumor format occur in male mice which had a signific increas in malign lymphoma after further evalu of the avail data and consid the avail statist the high background rate of lymphoma in the strain of mice use in the ntp bioassay and the statement made by the ntp work group and the qualiti assess narrat which was submit by the comment epa agre that there is insuffici evid to conclud that the malign lymphoma observ in male mice were treatment relat and that long chain chlorin paraffin should not be classifi as potenti carcinogen therefor the agenc conclud that there is insuffici evid to list long chain chlorin paraffin on the epcra section 313 list b short chain chlorin paraffin iarc has classifi the short chain chlorin paraffin as group 2b ie suffici evid for carcinogen in anim and probabl carcinogen in human detail respons to all of the comment concern the toxic of the short chain speci are contain in the respons to comment document ref 14 summari of the respons to the most signific comment concern flaw in the studi use to support the list of the short chain speci are provid below 1 the agenc agre that the kidney tumor observ in rat are most like not relev to tumor format in man becaus the male rat kidney possess a uniqu protein a 2 m globulin which has been shown to be respons for the develop of rat liver kidney tumor not onli after administr of short chain chlorin paraffin but after administr of mani other chemic also howev to state that chlorin paraffin bind to a protein which is similar to a 2 m globulin and that this bind is not seen in guinea pig as evid that kidney tumor format is not relev to human tumor format in this instanc is not a convinc argument 2 the agenc agre that forc gavag feed may not be a relev rout of administr when one is use the data for human risk assess in this instanc the data are be use as an indic of potenti human hazard and epa accept the data as be indic of such potenti 3 epa believ that corn oil is an accept vehicl of administr for mani in vivo studi becaus it is relat inert and has not been shown to interact with test agent 4 the b6c3f1 mous is the accept test speci of the ntp and epa has no reason to question the ntps choic of test speci nor to discount result of cancer bioassay use this speci 5 epa doe not believ that non genotox is a suffici reason to dismiss the relev to man of tumor format by the short chain chlorin paraffin non genotox may be a factor in select a model to use for dose respons estim onc tumor format has been establish but it is not a reason to disregard the signific of tumor which are form by agent which are non genotox in short term test 6 the agenc is not convinc that failur to observ liver growth peroxisom prolifer in hepatocyt and stimul of replic dna in guinea pig is proof that these effect are specif to rat and mice and have no bear on tumor format in human 7 the agenc agre that there was a perturb of thyroxin level in treat anim but doe not agre that the observ tumor are therefor irrelev therefor the agenc find that there is suffici evid for list short chain chlorin paraffin on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail carcinogen data for these chemic i ecotox data courtauld aerospac occident chemic corpor and the american automobil manufactur associ contend that ecotox data are onli avail for the short chain 10 to 13 carbon 59 percent chlorin chlorin paraffin the comment object to epa assum the same ecotox for all member of the chlorin paraffin categori becaus of the potenti differ in effect relat to chain length and chlorin content although it was state as such in the propos rule epa did not intend to equat the ecotox of the short chain chlorin paraffin with the ecotox of other member of the categori the ecotox data on the short chain chemic was provid as further support for the list of the short chain chemic howev as epa is not final the addit of the long chain speci this issu is no longer relev ii chlorin paraffin versus chlorin a olefin oxychem the american automobil manufactur associ the associ of intern automobil manufactur the independ lubric manufactur associ and the chlorin paraffin industri associ correct state that epa propos definit of chlorin paraffin doe not exclud chlorin a olefin the comment further contend that chlorin paraffin and chlorin a olefin are distinct differ chemic with differ physic chemic and biolog properti the inform provid by the comment doe not substanti their claim that chlorin paraffin and chlorin a olefin are distinct differ chemic with differ physic chemic properti the main differ between chlorin paraffin and chlorin a olefin that epa is awar of is that chlorin paraffin typic manufactur from paraffin mixtur are also mixtur wherea individu chlorin a olefin can be manufactur in moder to high puriti the issu is whether a pure chlorin a olefin fall within the rang of structur characterist that vari in a chlorin paraffin mixtur in this case epa believ that there are no signific structur differ between chlorin paraffin and chlorin a olefin both are primarili linear hydrochlorocarbon and the degre of chlorin of both group of substanc can be control sixti percent chlorin of 1 dodecen for exampl would yield a product with the formula c 12 h 19 cl 7 and a molecular weight of approxim 411 sixti percent chlorin of the short chain grade paraffin mixtur would yield a mixtur of product with an averag formula of c 12 h 19 cl 7 and an averag molecular weight of approxim 411 the comment claim that the chlorin posit in chlorin a olefin differ signific compar to the chlorin posit in chlorin paraffin epa doe not believ that chlorin at carbon 1 and 2 of the a olefin make a signific differ in the major of the isom form by both reaction and even if it did there are no data that indic that have two of the chlorin at carbon 1 and 2 is signific from a toxic standpoint the comment do not substanti their claim mass spectral data submit by one comment is inconclus and cannot be use in support for or against the comment posit epa is not awar of experiment evid that suggest that the possibl variat in chlorin posit between the chlorin paraffin and the chlorin a olefin differ signific from the variat possibl within these two group of substanc sinc for the a olefin the first two chlorin are ad at carbon 1 and 2 the relat amount rather than type of each isom form may differ between the chlorin of paraffin and a olefin especi as the degre of chlorin decreas the comment claim that chlorin a olefin are distinct differ from chlorin paraffin becaus their physic properti are veri differ is unjustifi as discuss in detail in the respons to comment document ref 14 the physic properti of discreet chemic cannot be compar to those of chemic mixtur the comment do not discuss specif differ between chlorin paraffin and chlorin a olefin and therefor do not substanti their claim they do howev elabor on the differ between structur within the chlorin paraffin group particular those structur that repres the extrem in the c 10 to c 30 rang this discuss is therefor more relev to the issu of list categori versus individu chemic discuss subsequ and doe not address the issu of differ in the physic properti between chlorin paraffin and chlorin a olefin discuss previous furthermor epa believ that the specif differ between structur extrem within the chlorin paraffin group that the comment elabor on are trend that are also observ between structur extrem within the chlorin a olefin group a valid comparison of physic properti data can onli be made between two discreet substanc of known puriti or in some case between two mixtur of chemic with well defin composit epa believ that an a olefin and a paraffin both with the same chain length and both with the same degre of chlorin are essenti ident structur especi if the degre of chlorin is high the same isom can be predict for the chlorin of an a olefin and a paraffin of the same chain length the physic properti of chlorin a olefin and the correspond chlorin paraffin are therefor expect to be veri similar the differ in the chemic and physic properti that the comment refer to are larg or complet due to the fact that the chlorin paraffin are mixtur of differ chain length while the chlorin a olefin typic are compos of a singl chain length iii categori definit sinc epa has determin that onli the short chain speci meet the list requir of epcra section 313 the

methodolog exist to identifi all of the thousand of chemic that would be cover by a pac categori base on the altern broad definit epa is therefor not final the altern propos to creat a pac categori base on the broad definit but is final the propos delimit pac categori as explain abov epa believ that although it may be necessari to perform a chemic by chemic analysi for member of this delimit categori the most appropri way to track releas and transfer under epcra section 313 is by creat this categori as explain abov the chevron compani amoco corpor mobil oil unoc pennzoil and the american

chemic the 11th compound 1 nitropyren cas no 5522 43 0 was classifi by iarc as a group 2b chemic ie a possibl human carcinogen the iarc classif and a review of the data indic that the data is suffici to support the list of this chemic on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b a second compound dibenzo a e fluoranthen cas no 5385 75 1 was classifi by epa as a b2 categori chemic the chemic is a probabl human carcinogen which justifi it addit to epcra section 313 pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b upon further review of the other 9 iarc group c chemic the agenc believ that a more detail review of their relationship to the 19 pac for which cancer data is avail and is suffici is necessari befor they can be place on the list on the basi of structur alon therefor epa will not add these 9 chemic to the epcra section 313 list at this time and the delin categori will consist of the other 19 chemic propos for this categori epcra section 313 requir threshold determin

high dose 2 500 ppm equival to 325 mg kg day was excess toxic howev the agenc also determin that the mid dose 500 ppm equival to 65 mg kg day was not consid suffici high to evalu the carcinogen potenti of propiconazol the agenc believ that a supplementari studi should be conduct in male mice at dose select to suffici evalu carcinogen potenti without excess toxic at this time howev base on the current avail evid propiconazol remain classifi as a group c possibl human carcinogen with the rfd approach recommend for quantif of human risk the comment further state that relat minor

that pregnant rat exhibit abnorm behavior sign at 90 but not at 30 mg kg day although the agenc agre that there is not suffici evid for hepatotox potenti of triallat the agenc doe not concur with the comment that pregnant rat exhibit abnorm behavior sign at 90 but not at 30 mg kg day head bob and circl clear sign of neurotox were observ in pregnant femal at 30 mg kg day male and non pregnant femal did not exhibit these clinic sign these data suggest that pregnant rat are more suscept to the neurolog potenti of triallat than the general popul the comment note the exist of a subchron neurotox studi in rat and indic that this studi provid a better estim of the neurotox potenti of triallat than the 2 generat reproduct studi the agenc agre that the subchron neurotox studi in rat ref 10 provid a clearer pictur of the neurotox potenti of triallat the agenc has review this studi and conclud that the result indic the neurotox potenti of triallat and further corrobor the find cite by epa in the propos rule thus the agenc reaffirm that there is suffici evid for list triallat on the epcra section 313 list pursuant to epcra section 313 d 2 b base on the avail chronic neurotox data for this chemic therefor epa is final the addit of triallat on the epcra section 313 list g chemic not be ad to epcra section 313 1 5 chloro 2 2 4 dichlorophenoxi phenol ciba geigi corpor and the dial corpor contend that insuffici evid is avail to support the conclus that 5 chloro 2 2 4 dichlorophenoxi phenol pose a risk of hematolog toxic to human base on handl and use of the product base on these comment and epa reanalysi of the data the agenc has conclud that the inform present in the propos rule is not suffici to justifi ad 5 chloro 2 2 4 dichlorophenoxi phenol to the epcra section 313 list base upon potenti human hazard therefor epa is not final the addit of this chemic on the epcra section 313 list 2 clomazon fmc corpor claim that clomazon induc advers effect onli at high dose level the agenc agre with the comment base on these comment and epa reanalysi of the data the agenc has conclud that the inform present in the propos rule is not suffici to justifi ad clomazon to the epcra section 313 list base upon potenti human hazard therefor epa is not final the addit of this chemic to epcra section 313 3 tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacet eight comment contend that the propos list for this chemic was base sole on a singl unreli development toxic studi which use a mixtur that contain tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacet along with sever other chemic epa conced that the

comment 1 year to year comparison of the tri data bp america texaco and american automobil manufactur associ contend that the propos expans of the epcra section 313 list will elimin ani consist with earlier tri data and make track environment progress imposs american automobil manufactur associ further state that epa need to ensur that the total tri releas and transfer measur system allow accur interpret of the data allow the public to realist assess progress in pollut prevent also the comment add that consider confus result in tri to explain the differ data set to the public mobil oil corpor state that epa should divid the list into three sub group so that a facil histori can be track on a more common basi epa recogn that chang in the epcra section 313 list and in the report requir have an effect on the character of the tri data in fact some chang has occur for everi report year in an attempt to provid use year to year comparison epa has present the tri data annual on a normal list of chemic ie the list of chemic use for year to year comparison is the same for everi year in the comparison epa further recogn the effect that expans of the epcra section 313 list will have on the tri data and will continu to work to find way to make the data useabl for cross year comparison epa will use the 1995 report year as the base year for comparison that includ the chemic ad today facil should still be abl to track pollut prevent progress for those chemic previous list use 1988 as the base year and have a new base year for the addit chemic which can be use to track futur pollut prevent progress 2 public percept roussel uclaf corpor nation paint and coat associ associ of intern automobil manufactur and american frozen food institut oppos the list of these chemic under epcra section 313 becaus of the public mispercept of the associ danger american automobil manufactur associ aama state that sinc the public consid all chemic on the epcra section 313 list to be toxic ani chemic on the list is subject to advers scrutini regardless of the actual risk associ with the chemic while recogn past effort by epa toward public educ aama believ that misunderstand and misinterpret of the data still exist which make it more critic that epa not expand the list with low risk chemic texaco and aama believ that befor the agenc expand the epcra section 313 list resourc should be commit to provid public educ on actual risk portray by the data and educ the public on viabl mean of chemic risk reduct and chemic manag the chemic that are list under epcra section 313 exhibit a wide rang of effect at various dose level while epa attempt to communic the tri data in the most accur manner the agenc recogn that there exist the percept that the tri data may sometim be mischaracter but that doe not justifi not ad a chemic for which the statutori criteria are clear met epa agre that the better approach to such a problem is improv public inform on the chemic which combin with the releas transfer and wast manag data will enabl the public to particip in inform environment decis make epa continu to attempt to provid the public with mean for interpret the tri data 3 persist bioaccumul chemic in the propos rule epa request comment on whether chemic that are manufactur in trace amount in wast stream are high toxic at veri low dose level and have physic chemic or biolog properti that make the chemic persist for extend period in the environ and bioaccumul through the food chain should be list on the epcra section 313 list januari 12 1994 59 fr 1791 epa note that persist bioaccumul toxic chemic such as dioxin are of particular concern in ecosystem such as the great lake basin due to the long retent time of the individu lake and the cycl of the chemic from one compon of the ecosystem to anoth epa also request comment on the follow if epa were to add this type of chemic to epcra section 313 what modif to epcra section 313 such as lower the report threshold and modifi the de minimi in mixtur exempt 40 cfr 372 38 would be requir to ensur that releas and transfer inform would be collect in addit to two comment oppos to the addit of this type of chemic epa receiv 35 comment support the addit of toxic persist bioaccumul chemic the major of these comment also support lower the report threshold for this type of chemic monsanto and dow chemic compani object to the addit of persist bioaccumul chemic that are produc in quantiti less than the epcra section 313 report threshold the comment state that mani of the persist bioaccumul toxic compound which are of concern are no longer manufactur in the unit state and are mere present in the environ due to histor activ and not current activ epa disagre with this content epa request for comment focus on chemic that are generat in small quantiti this is not limit to chemic produc as a product but includ chemic that are generat in wast stream mani persist bioaccumul toxic chemic are produc in wast stream further epcra section 313 requir the report of chemic manufactur in wast stream if the quantiti produc exceed the appropri report threshold monsanto further claim that the amount of these particular danger substanc come from industri facil are so small that they can have no measur impact on health or the environ epa disagre that releas of these chemic are so low that they will not have an advers effect upon human health or the environ the persist bioaccumul aspect of these toxic chemic are such that even veri small quantiti releas can reason be anticip to caus advers effect upon human health and the environ monsanto also state that the concept of differ report threshold suggest that this threshold would be proport to the relat hazard threshold for practic non toxic chemic may be veri high use this concept epa request comment on lower the threshold for these chemic not so that the report threshold for chemic list on the epcra section 313 list would be proport to the relat hazard of the chemic rather epa request comment on lower the threshold for persist bioaccumul chemic becaus even minim releas of these chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ or in an organ that can reason be anticip to result in signific advers effect this reflect the increas likelihood that there will be exposur to a chemic that persist due to it longer resid time in the environ repeat minim releas of a persist chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ for a chemic that bioaccumul even low level of the chemic in the environ may result in increas concentr in an organ thus lower threshold for these substanc would be consid due to the persist and bioaccumul natur of the substanc rather than the direct hazard in it next action to add chemic to the epcra section 313 list the agenc intend to consid the addit of chemic that are persist and bioaccumul epa also intend to consid lower the report threshold for these addit chemic and those chemic that are persist and bioaccumul that are now on the epcra section 313 list accord comment receiv in respons to epa request for comment on the potenti addit of persist bioaccumul will be address in the futur rulemak if these chemic are propos for addit 4 addit chemic the wisconsin depart of natur resourc state that the epcra section 313 chemic list should be expand to includ the six chemic list in section 112 b of the caa not current includ on the epcra section 313 list or as part of the januari 12 1994 propos epa has review all of the chemic list under section 112 b of the caa not current on the epcra section 313 list and has determin that the remain chemic either do not meet the current list criteria or no report would be receiv sinc their product volum are below report threshold 5 hormon mimic the nation wildlif feder recommend that epa add to the section 313 list all chemic with estrogen or other hormon mimick qualiti and the report threshold and de minimi exempt for mixtur elimin for these chemic epa agre that the deleteri effect of hormon mimick chemic may warrant their futur review for list on the epcra section 313 list although the effect of these chemic are difficult to predict and it is often imposs to establish a clear caus effect relationship still it is clear from the avail evid that these chemic warrant consider wide scale chang in wildlif and human popul have been note by some research popul decreas and reproduct effect have been link to these chemic in a number of wildlif speci includ but not limit to bear florida panther songbird and bald eagl to list just a few possibl of greater concern are the effect of these chemic in human in addit to the carcinogen potenti of mani of these chemic effect on fertil immun system damag and mani childhood problem have been attribut to hormon mimic a number of the chemic with widespread distribut in the environ report to have reproduct and endocrin disrupt effect ref 1 are either alreadi on the epcra section 313 list or are be ad as a result of this action epa may consid review the remain chemic on this list as part of a futur action as to remov the report threshold and de minimi exempt for the hormon mimick chemic alreadi on the section 313 list these possibl will be examin at the time that modifi the report threshold and de minimi exempt for persist and bioaccumul chemic is address as mani of the hormon mimick chemic are also either persist or bioaccumul they could be includ as part of such a review i comment on epa regulatori impact assess comment that are specif to individu chemic or chemic categori are address in the respons to comment document ref 14 mani comment state that epa regulatori impact analysi ria fail to meet the requir of execut order 12866 which mandat regulatori plan and review the comment state that 1 the ria for the propos rule did not analyz ani altern other than ad the 313 chemic and chemic categori to the epcra section 313 list 2 that it exclud the econom effect due to compli with state local and other feder requir that are trigger when a chemic is list under epcra section 313 and 3 that it did not analyz the benefit of the rule mani comment also contend that small busi impact were underst in the ria and that the time requir for complianc is higher than estim in the ria these comment and the agenc respons are discuss below 1 altern the comment believ that the ria should have includ altern to ad all of the propos chemic and chemic categori to the epcra section 313 list in respons to these comment epa has revis the ria to includ a varieti of altern such as ad the caa criteria air pollut not ad chemic regul under fifra not ad the water dissoci nitrat compound categori and ad the propos chemic in conjunct with an altern report threshold for facil with low level of tri chemic in wast the comment request that epa present the cost for ad each individu chemic epa cannot provid the cost on an individu chemic basi becaus the estim for most of the chemic were deriv from confidenti busi inform display the cost for each chemic could disclos this confidenti inform 2 link requir numer comment state that the ria exclud the cost of complianc with state local and other feder requir that are trigger when a chemic is list under epcra section 313 the link requir that the comment rais includ state tax and fee state pollut prevent plan requir special requir for certain nation pollut discharg elimin system npdes storm water permit and requir for feder facil under execut order 12856 epa has revis the ria to discuss state and feder requir that are link to report under epcra section 313 howev epa has not quantifi the cost of such requir in some case this is becaus there is insuffici data to make a reason estim in other case epa doe not believ that the requir repres a social cost the requir that may be link to list under epcra section 313 are discuss below a state fee thirteen state place a tax or fee on facil file tri form r report these state are colorado florida iowa kansa main massachusett minnesota mississippi nevada ohio pennsylvania south dakota and texa mani comment estim that the cost result from state fee and tax link to epcra section 313 report are up to 50 percent of the direct cost of file the form and state that ani tax is like to induc a reduct in econom welfar epa has revis the ria to discuss state fee and tax that are link to report under epcra section 313 howev the tax and fee are not direct social cost and epa doe not believ that there is suffici inform to estim the net social cost or benefit of these requir the comment treat state tax and fee on the epcra section 313 report as cost but these are transfer payment and not econom cost to societi specif the standard definit of a cost in econom is the consumpt of a resourc eg labor equip natur resourc etc a tax or fee is a transfer payment from one parti to anoth while the fee is a cost to the firm and or it custom it is incom to the state no resourc are consum except for transact cost so the amount of the fee is not a cost to societi epa disagre with the comment content that ani tax or fee is like to induc a reduct in econom welfar epa believ that tax or fee on toxic chemic may resolv a market failur and increas social welfar the use of toxic chemic often creat a negat extern for instanc releas of a chemic may caus health and environment effect in the surround communiti in such case it is like that privat cost are below true social cost becaus privat market do not provid an adequ incent for firm to intern these extern in such case tax may be the optim method to correct the market failur epa believ that if the comment feel that the fee are not set at the level that optim social welfar their remedi lie with the appropri state agenc and not epa epa doe not feel that it is feasibl to estim the size of the transfer payment result from state fee and tax link to epcra section 313 or the net social cost or benefit of these payment the comment made their estim by appli the maximum state fee to all facil nation wide epa doe not feel that such a calcul is appropri most state have no fee or tax link to epcra section 313 report and the level of the fee or tax and how they are assess is differ in each of the rest of the state vari from 25 to 50 000 mani of the state requir are not flat fee but are graduat depend on the level of releas that a facil report an accur represent of the size of the transfer payment would requir estim the geograph distribut of new report and the level of releas and transfer for each report epa feel that it is not possibl to predict with a reason degre of accuraci the locat and level of releas for facil that will report on the chemic be ad to the epcra section 313 list nor is it feasibl to accur estim the net social cost or benefit of the state fee and tax to do so would requir know not onli the size of the transfer payment but the damag caus by the use and releas of the chemic and the chang in behavior that would result from the fee and tax epa doe not have adequ inform on the facil that would be affect by the rule to make such estim as a result the ria has been revis to qualit discuss state fee and tax link to epcra section 313 report but doe not estim the size of the result transfer payment or the net social cost or benefit b state pollut prevent program seven state arizona main massachusett minnesota mississippi new jersey and texa mandat pollut prevent plan from facil report under epcra section 313 facil in these state that are report to tri for the first time becaus of the addit to the chemic list will have to prepar pollut prevent plan although the develop of pollut prevent plan impos a cost on facil the ria did not analyz the cost of these requir mani comment contend that there are signific cost for prepar such plan and that the ria should have includ these cost quantifi the impact of state pollut prevent requir would requir predict which facil report for the addit chemic would be locat in these seven state as state abov it is not possibl to accur predict the geograph locat of new report thus no cost are estim for state pollut prevent plan in the ria nor doe the ria quantifi the benefit deriv from these pollut prevent plan requir none of the comment submit ani evid compar the social benefit of such requir to the cost therefor epa has no inform from which to conclud that the link requir for state pollut prevent plan would reduc the net social benefit of ad chemic to epcra section 313 epa has not quantit estim either the cost of state pollut prevent plan requir or the benefit of such program in the ria howev the ria has been revis to qualit discuss requir that are link to epcra section 313 report includ pollut prevent plan prepar c npdes storm water permit epa issu nation pollut discharg elimin system npdes baselin general permit for storm water discharg associ with industri activ on septemb 9 1992 57 fr 41236 epa subsequ propos a multi sector storm water industri permit cover 29 industri sector novemb 19 1993 58 fr 61147 the baselin general and multi sector general permit have special pollut prevent requir for certain epcra section 313 facil and the baselin permit also contain special monitor requir mani comment assert that the ria underestim the cost of the rule by a factor of up to 56 by not includ the cost of npdes storm water permit requir that are trigger by ad chemic to the epcra section 313 list epa believ that the comment estim are base on a cost scenario that is not applic to the typic facil affect by the propos to add chemic under epcra section 313 there are four reason that the comment estim are not general appropri ani of these reason alon demonstr that the comment have overestim the number of facil that are affect and the the size of the impact becaus there may also be a signific overlap among the four the comment estim are like to appli to few if ani facil the comment estim would not appli to all facil affect by the rule as the comment contend first onli a fraction of the facil that would report under epcra section 313 for the addit chemic would be affect by the npdes storm water permit a facil that submit tri form r is onli subject to storm water permit requir if industri materi or activ are expos to storm water and if the facil is report to tri for one of the section 313 water prioriti chemic onli about two dozen of the chemic be ad to the epcra section 313 list qualifi as section 313 water prioriti chemic and thus would be cover by the npdes requir about half of these are pesticid which would not be manufactur or process at mani facil second epa expect the major of facil to have exist contain system that meet most of the requir of the npdes permit third mani of the cost for the storm water requir are like to appli at the facil level in such case facil that instal system for the current epcra section 313 chemic will not face increment cost for the addit chemic fourth the special requir of the npdes storm water permit are base on the coverag of epcra section 313 at the time the permit were issu the npdes requir do not appli to chemic that are ad to the epcra section 313 list until the time of permit renew which occur everi 5 year and may not appli in subsequ permit depend on the agenc decis at the time those permit are issu in addit the comment base their estim sole on the upper bound of epa estim for the npdes permit and have ignor the mix of low cost and high cost facil that is like to exist epa believ that the comment estim is a hypothet worst case scenario that doe not appli to the typic facil and may not appli to ani facil epa believ that the cost of the storm water requir for the propos chemic will be relat minor again epa has revis the ria to qualit discuss the linkag between epcra section 313 report and the npdes storm water but it has not made ani quantit estim of these cost d execut order 12856 execut order 12856 sign by the presid in august 1993 extend the coverag of epcra to feder facil in addit section 3 303 a of the execut order state that each feder agenc shall establish a plan and goal for elimin or reduc the unnecessari acquisit by that agenc of product contain extrem hazard substanc or toxic chemic emphasi ad the execut order defin toxic chemic as a substanc on the list describ in section 313 of epcra mani comment contend that the cost to the feder govern and the privat sector of compli with execut order 12856 for the chemic be ad to epcra section 313 will be 15 billion per year epa doe not believ that the effect of execut order 12856 should have a bear on the decis make regard the addit of toxic chemic to epcra section 313 epa believ that follow the comment line of reason would discourag the feder govern from ever make ani chang in procur for whatev reason becaus do so might have an impact on a supplier furthermor epa believ that there is insuffici data to make ani estim of the effect of the execut order and that the resourc requir to make such an estim would exceed the valu of the inform epa note that section 3 303 a of the execut order doe not requir the elimin of toxic chemic in feder procur if the perform characterist of a toxic chemic or product contain a toxic chemic are critic in the requir task feder agenc may continu to purchas it each feder agenc must make it own determin whether a particular toxic chemic is necessari in a particular use the execut order requir that feder agenc elimin or reduc the unnecessari procur of extrem hazard substanc or toxic chemic none of the comment identifi which toxic chemic are be unnecessarili purchas by the feder govern and which feder agenc are make these unnecessari purchas without such inform epa cannot verifi the comment claim that the addit of chemic to epcra section 313 will creat signific impact as a result of the execut order if these chemic are not be purchas by the feder govern or are not be purchas unnecessarili there will not be an impact the comment estim of 15 billion in cost is base sole on a seri of assumpt which are not support by data epa doe not believ that the comment analysi was base on a care analysi of ani factual inform epa has no data with which to replac these assumpt given epa belief that effect of the execut order should not have a bear on the rulemak as well as the limit of the execut order the small amount of procur that would be affect and the abil of produc to sell to privat sector client or manufactur substitut epa doe not believ that there is a need to develop ani data on these factor the execut order state that the environment energi and econom benefit of energi and water use reduct are veri signific and that the feder govern has the opportun to realiz signific econom as well as environment benefit of pollut prevent the execut order provid a mandat for the feder govern to reduc it unnecessari use of toxic chemic epa believ that the propos to add chemic to the section 313 list complement this mandat furthermor epa hope that feder agenc will compli with the spirit of the order and reduc their unnecessari use of toxic and hazard chemic whether or not these chemic are list on the epcra section 313 list epa believ that by definit the social benefit cannot exceed the social cost for an unnecessari toxic chemic and social welfar can be improv by switch to a substitut product therefor epa believ that ani action feder agenc take to meet their oblig under execut order 12856 will have a posit net benefit 3 benefit mani comment assert that the ria did not show ani benefit to ad chemic to the epcra section 313 list of chemic the comment appear to have made these statement becaus epa did not make a quantit estim of the benefit associ with the rule there are two type of benefit associ with epcra section 313 the first type of benefit is due to improv in understand awar and decis make relat to the provis and distribut of inform the second type of benefit deriv from chang in behavior that result from the inform report to tri these benefit includ reduc environment and health risk and reduc treatment and dispos cost these chang in behavior come at some cost to societi becaus the current state of knowledg about the econom of inform is not high develop epa has not attempt to quantifi the pure inform benefit of ad chemic to the epcra section 313 list becaus of the inher uncertainti in the chain of event epa has also not attempt to quantifi the benefit or the cost of the chang in behavior that result from the inform epa doe not believ that there are adequ methodolog to make reason quantit estim of either type of benefit howev epa believ that it qualit discuss of the effect of the current tri program show that such benefit do exist the inform on the addit chemic is expect to improv scientif understand of the environ and health risk foster greater communiti awar of industri activ and allow feder state and local author to make better inform decis on accept level of toxic chemic in communiti instead epa has drawn it conclus about the net benefit of ad chemic to epcra section 313 by infer in enact epcra and the ppa congress implicit determin that the net benefit of report was posit for the origin list of 320 chemic and categori epa interpret of the statutori toxic criteria is more stringent than congress origin determin becaus epa has delet 12 chemic from the origin list of 320 chemic and categori develop by congress epa believ that all of the chemic be final meet the statutori toxic criteria of section 313 and are at least as toxic as some of the chemic for which congress believ there were net benefit due to report thus by infer the net benefit of report for the chemic ad in this rulemak should be posit as well epa believ that the experi of the past 5 year show that report under epcra section 313 has produc real gain in understand about exposur to toxic chemic epa see no reason whi the inform on the addit chemic will provid less understand than the current report chemic have provid 4 small busi under the regulatori flexibl act 5 usc section 601 612 agenc must prepar an analysi of small busi impact for propos rule mani comment contend that small busi impact were underst in the ria and they question epa conclus that the rule will not have a signific impact on a substanti number of small entiti epa believ that the comment have signific overestim the cost of the rule and that the comment estim of small busi impact are not valid epa has provid addit analysi in the ria for the final rule that demonstr that the rule will not have signific cost impact on small entiti epa believ that whether or not the propos rule would have had signific cost impact on small entiti the agenc has subsequ met it oblig under the regulatori flexibl act where a propos rule would have signific impact on small entiti the act requir epa to identifi and consid but not necessarili adopt altern that minim the impact on these entiti while accomplish the state object of the applic statut elsewher in this issu of the feder regist epa is final a rule establish an altern threshold for low level of tri chemic in wast that would otherwis meet the report requir under epcra section 313 such facil can submit an annual certif statement in lieu of a tri form r epa estim that facil will requir an averag of 34 hour to compli with the requir for a certif statement compar to 53 hour for a tri form r the altern report threshold will appli to the chemic be ad under epcra section 313 by this rule as well as chemic current list under epcra section 313 epa guidelin for implement the regulatori flexibl act state that the altern consid for the purpos of fulfil the act requir need not be restrict in applic to small entiti regulatori altern that prove to be more cost effect for small entiti often will be more cost effect for larger entiti as well for exampl altern that place lesser burden on facil with lower emiss level lower product level etc should be analyz in conjunct with fulfil the act requir even though such altern may not eas the burden on all or even most small entiti and may benefit larg entiti as well as small one becaus epa has consid and adopt an altern that place lesser burden on facil with lower emiss level epa believ that it has met the requir of the regulatori flexibl act the altern threshold will provid signific relief for small busi that will report for the propos chemic which is the intent of the act 5 report burden mani comment report that the time requir for complianc with epcra section 313 is higher than that estim in the ria comment estim of the time requir to prepar a tri form r and perform the necessari recordkeep vari from 91 to 2 000 hour compar with epa estim of 53 hour the unit time estim use by epa are averag valu epa recogn that larg multi division multi department facil may requir more than the averag time to compli as with ani averag some facil will be abov the averag and other will be below it howev there are mani other facil subject to the rule that are not larg multi division or multi department these facil will typic have a simpler complianc process the variabl among facil is evid in comment on the rule submit by a larg chemic manufactur compani that provid estim show that it spend an averag of 28 hour for each tri form r that is submit to compil inform perform calcul prepar the tri form r and maintain record this includ the time spent on complianc determin for chemic that are below threshold level this is less than epa estim of 53 hour for the same activ while some of the comment may requir more time than averag to compli with the rule other compani requir less time than averag epa believ that it time estim are a reason averag for the

threshold are base on a 500 pound level of total wast 1 this includ 39 chemic as part of two delin categori the cost for the final rule are differ from the cost for the propos rule as shown in tabl 2 there are two reason for this chang first the number of chemic and chemic categori ad has decreas from 313 to 286 which reduc the number of report that would be submit second the number of report estim for one chemic water dissoci nitrat compound report onli when in aqueous solut was increas from 2 146 to 3 066 to account for facil that creat water dissoci nitrat compound in aqueous solut through on site biolog treatment of wastewat elsewher in this issu of the feder regist epa is final a rule establish an altern threshold for facil with low amount of a list toxic chemic in wast see unit ii of this preambl qualifi facil would be elig to submit an annual certif statement instead of a tri form r becaus the time requir for the altern threshold is less than the time requir for a tri form r the cost of complianc with this rule will be lower as a result the effect of the altern threshold on the chemic be ad by this rule is demonstr in tabl 2 further inform on the effect of the altern threshold is present elsewher in this issu of the feder regist the cost describ in tabl 2 repres onli those action that are requir by this rule there are other requir that are link to report under epcra section 313 but which are not requir by this rule there are 13 state that place a fee or tax on facil that file a tri form r or report to epa under epcra section 313 and 7 state that mandat pollut prevent plan from such facil epa has also creat special requir for certain facil with npdes storm water permit that report under epcra section 313 ad chemic and chemic categori to the epcra section 313 list may caus some facil to incur addit cost through these link requir these cost have not been monet but they should not be signific the link fee and tax are transfer and not social cost and mani of the report facil will not be locat in the 13 state with fee and tax also the npdes and pollut prevent plan requir are most like to creat cost for facil that are new report there will be approxim 1 225 new report as a result of this rule although not all of these will be subject to the npdes requir or be locat in state with pollut prevent plan requir the linkag to the npdes requir is limit to about two dozen of the new chemic not all 286 chemic and chemic categori be ad the market failur that this rule is intend to correct is the extern creat by the lack of inform avail to citizen about the releas and transfer of toxic chemic in their communiti take no action would allow this extern and the result social cost to continu it is expect that this rulemak will generat benefit by provid citizen with access to inform that otherwis would not be avail to them the benefit of the rule itself are limit to improv in understand awar and decis make relat to the provis and distribut of inform epa believ that the rulemak can reason be anticip to indirect yield health and environment benefit by lead to reduct in the releas and transfer of toxic chemic these chang in behavior come at some cost to industri the net benefit of the follow on activ are the differ between the benefit of decreas chemic releas and transfer and the cost of the action need to achiev them as note abov epa has not quantifi the benefit of this rule or the follow on activ this action was submit to omb for review as requir by execut order 12866 and ani comment or chang made in respons to omb suggest or recommend have been document in the public record b regulatori flexibl act the regulatori flexibl act of 1980 requir each feder agenc to perform a regulatori flexibl analysi for all rule that are like to have a signific impact on a substanti number of small entiti epa investig the potenti impact of the propos rule on small busi and has prepar a final regulatori flexibl analysi frfa this assess has been includ as part of the ria and is summar below in assess small busi impact epa calcul the cost incur by two hypothet facil that are supplier notif facil report to the tri for the first time facil were assum to file onli form rs instead of ani annual certif statement thus the result are base on conserv assumpt the first facil file a report for a singl new chemic while the other file report for four new chemic for each hypothet facil annual regulatori cost were calcul and compar to averag annual sale the cost impact ratio were calcul base on the averag annual sale of those facil current report under epcra section 313 for which annual sale and employe figur could be obtain from dun bradstreet the dun bradstreet data base was use instead of census data on the assumpt that facil that report under epcra section 313 are not uniform distribut throughout the entir popul of facil in each size categori epa believ that it is reason to assum that facil report under epcra section 313 have on averag larger annual sale than the typic facil in an industri therefor the annual sale of current report should be a more appropri measur than the sale of all facil in an industri a small busi was defin as have fewer than 50 employe although a more detail break down of size categori would have allow for a closer examin of the potenti impact on even smaller facil the total number of observ in the match data base was too small to allow for addit categori epa often use a cost impact percentag of one percent as a threshold measur below which facil are not consid to be signific impact as a result of a regul under the scenario in which facil are assum to submit one tri form r the cost impact percentag are well below one percent for all employe size class in all sic the highest cost impact percentag is 04 percent for small facil in standard industri classif sic code 25 furnitur and 31 leather in the first year of report under the scenario in which facil are assum to submit four tri form rs cost impact percentag in the first year of report are abov one percent onli for small facil in sic code 25 12 percent and 31 11 percent cost impact percentag are below 08 percent for all industri in subsequ year the higher impact rate for the hypothet facil occur in industri sector where there have histor been a relat small number of establish report approxim 8 percent of all facil in sic code 25 furnitur and 10 percent of all facil in sic code 31 leather current report to epcra section 313 compar to 57 percent of all facil in the chemic industri it is reason that larg and medium busi are more high repres in these percentag than small busi becaus they would be more like to exceed the epcra section 313 threshold in addit facil in sic 25 and 31 have typic submit fewer than four report each and would be less like to submit four report for the new chemic than facil in other industri thus cost impact for facil potenti affect by the rule were not found to be of suffici magnitud to caus signific impact although epa has found that the rule doe not result in signific impact on small facil epa has separ develop altern to meet the goal of the regulatori flexibl act ie to accomplish the object of epcra section 313 while minim the econom impact on small entiti epa propos a rule establish an altern report threshold for low level releas and transfer juli 28 1994

label indic to consum that the product contribut less lead to drink and cook water than faucet that fail to meet the certif requir vi review and control of new use of lead a rational to date epa programmat effort have focus on exist use of lead becaus there is substanti evid that exposur to lead has advers human health and environment impact the agenc howev is also concern about new use of lead becaus they may result in new or increas exposur which may present an unreason risk of injuri to human health and the environ new or increas exposur to lead may aris from 1 increas in the volum of lead consum 2 increas in the concentr of lead in product 3 new product contain lead and 4 chang in product design that increas the amount of lead releas from a product epa believ that it concern about new use is justifi in light of lead physic properti and low cost attribut which make it an attract raw materi for a broad varieti of commerci and consum product consequ the agenc believ that the regul of exist use alon may not be suffici to reduc lead exposur to the greatest extent practic epa should also evalu and if necessari regul new use of lead befor opportun for exposur occur the agenc further believ that address risk prior to commerci use is more effect than respond to exposur and risk after the use is introduc commerci becaus children are especi vulner to the impact of lead epa is particular concern about new use that could present risk to children consist with the agenc overal lead risk reduct program epa is also seek to address risk to adult and the environ from new use of lead the agenc therefor is explor the possibl of issu signific new use rule for certain use of element lead and lead compound under section 5 a of tsca b the snur process section 5 a of tsca provid epa with the author to screen new use of a chemic substanc to determin whether these use should be regul this screen function is accomplish through the snur process epa may issu a snur for a chemic substanc after consid relev factor includ 1 the project volum of manufactur and process of a chemic substanc 2 the extent to which a use chang the type or form of human or environment exposur to a chemic substanc 3 the extent to which a use increas the magnitud and durat of human or environment exposur to a chemic substanc and 4 the reason anticip manner and method of manufactur process distribut in commerc and dispos of a chemic substanc have consid all the relev factor epa can then issu a snur that identifi the chemic substanc and specifi one or more use as signific new use epa also has the option to publish a snur that defin ani use meet specifi criteria as a signific new use under a third option epa may list all past and exist use of the substanc and defin ani use not on that list as a signific new use after epa promulg a snur for a chemic substanc tsca requir that a snun be submit to the administr at least 90 day befor the start of manufactur or process of the signific new use s base on the inform provid in the snun and other relev data submit the agenc will evalu the risk that the use present to human health and the environ epa can for good caus extend the review period for a maximum of 90 day if base on it review the agenc determin that the signific new use may present an unreason risk of injuri to human health or the environ but lack the inform necessari to make a definit find it can issu an order to prohibit or limit the manufactur process or distribut in commerc of the use while it continu it risk evalu onc epa has made it risk find it can either 1 take long term action to prohibit or limit the manufactur process or distribut in commerc of the use if the use present or will present unreason risk of injuri to human health and the environmentm or 2 take no action if it find that there is no unreason risk when make a determin of unreason risk epa consid the risk of the use to human health and the environ the benefit of the use the avail of substitut and the econom consequ of ani limit on the use in short section 5 of tsca give epa the author to promulg a snur base on factor relat to exposur and volum a snur requir notif of the signific new use s follow notif the agenc evalu the risk of the use s to determin whether it should limit or prohibit the use s epa solicit comment on the effect of use this approach for lead as well as altern approach to protect human health and the environ from lead exposur c formul an approach for lead to date epa has promulg snur for substanc where exist use is limit to a few applic and product these snur typic identifi all exist use of the substanc that is the subject of the snur lead howev is use in hundr of product and process across mani industri due to it physic properti and low cost the widespread use of lead make the complet identif of all exist use of lead extrem difficult the tradit approach of first identifi all exist use of a chemic substanc therefor may not be appropri for develop of a lead snur to regul new use of lead in a sensibl and protect manner epa intend to establish an altern approach that can be use to identifi signific new use this approach consist of two compon a target strategi and criteria for defin signific new use 1 target strategi the widespread use of lead in commerc has prompt epa to develop a strategi that target new lead use where exposur to lead could reason be expect to occur as a result of the design or anticip use of the product for exampl the agenc would be concern about a new use of lead in a product where lead could be inadvert ingest by children eg use of lead base artist paint in home studio contribut lead to household dust the strategi also target new use of lead that could result in adult and environment exposur eg heat lead solder for household electr repair that could produc inhal vapor spent lead shot that could contamin habitat adjac to shoot rang in contrast epa doe not current plan to focus on use where human and or environment exposur would be less like to occur eg new circuit board use in comput and other electron product solder design for industri use in the electron industri batteri the agenc believ that use exposur to target new use of lead is an appropri tool and consist with the snur author under section 5 of tsca if in respons to a snur that epa promulg for specif lead use the agenc receiv a snun section 5 requir epa to determin if further regulatori action is warrant by assess whether the use present or will present an unreason risk of injuri to human health or the environ by use exposur as the criterion for identifi new use that would be subject to a snur epa intend to limit the snur and it notif requir to those new use where exposur is like and thus have the potenti to present unreason risk furthermor this target strategi would elimin from the requir new use where exposur is less like and the potenti for unreason risk may not exist current epa also doe not plan to focus on class of use where other type of regulatori control may be more appropri than the snur approach or where exist control are suffici in mani industri for exampl lead compound may be use dure new or modifi manufactur process chang in manufactur process can be a factor in defin a signific new use possibl result in occup exposur similar improp manag dispos of lead contain product could result in exposur through releas to groundwat landfil or the air inciner although epa is concern about such exposur the agenc believ that other regulatori mechan eg occup safeti and health act clean air act and rcra author are avail and in some case in place to address these problem other use of lead are exempt from regul as chemic substanc by epa under section 3 2 b of tsca for exampl exposur to lead through contamin of food and water from crystalwar ceramicwar and other housewar is regul by the food and drug administr fda under author grant by the feder food drug and cosmet act and other statut the fda use it author has establish action level for lead in ceram foodwar includ flatwar hollowar cup mug and pitcher the fda has also issu a public advisori on the storag of alcohol beverag in crystalwar provid enforc guidanc for lead in wine and has propos a total ban on the use of tin coat lead capsul on wine bottl epa is current examin five prioriti class of use for identif of possibl candid for lead snur each class is defin in term of a distinct exposur and or environment releas scenario these class reflect the agenc focus on health risk to children that may result from lead exposur the five use class are 1 product use in water convey system that come in contact with drink water the agenc has substanti evid that lead leach from compon of water distribut system and household plumb eg fixtur fit solder valv pump meter and tank 2 product common use in and or around the home where ordinari use eg manipul grind sand heat could result in releas of lead to the residenti environ for exampl the use of product such as home hobbyist suppli may contribut lead to household dust lead vapor from product that are design to be heat could be inhal 3 product that could be mouth by children where the lead contain compon in the product is reason access to children children could ingest lead by mouth the lead contain compon eg plastic toy where lead is use as a pigment or stabil and textil with lead base dye 4 product that can releas lead to the environ through exposur to weather element dure use lead could be releas through leach or through deterior of the product contamin dust and soil eg sheet lead for roof lead caulk traffic paint 5 product intend for non residenti eg recreat transport commerci and industri use where use necessarili result in uncontrol releas of lead to the environ exampl includ lead contain product where use involv 1 combust such as motor fuel addit result in deposit of lead in the environ and 2 dispers of the product in the

are present as illustr exampl and are not intend to repres an exhaust list furthermor these use may be exist use that would not be subject to the snur depend on the final definit of signific new use given the import of this target scheme in regul new use of lead the agenc is seek comment on this approach specif epa would like comment to address the follow issu 1 the appropri of use the target approach describ abov to design lead snur 2 whether the definit of ani of the five use class is particular unclear with respect to the type of use or product that might be cover 3 whether ani use class list in tabl 1 should not be includ in the target strategi and whi and 4 whether ani use class not list in tabl 1 should be includ in the target strategi and whi epa is particular interest in relev data that comment may possess which suggest that snur are or are not appropri for specif use class 2 criteria for identifi signific new use the second element of epa approach for regul new use of lead is criteria for defin signific new use of lead these criteria may includ the develop of a new product use ie product model or line chang in concentr of lead in a product use chang in surfac area and other factor that affect the amount of lead releas from a product and or chang in total volum of lead for a product use becaus lead is use in a broad rang of product involv numer industri it is like that the agenc will develop criteria that are specif to particular product use rather than one set of criteria that would be appli uniform when select criteria epa will endeavor not to defin as signific new use product or process that have been develop specif to reduc lead exposur epa doe not wish and doe not intend that ani snur for lead imped innov that would reduc risk to human health and the environ to aid in develop these criteria epa plan to establish a baselin inventori of exist use in the five use class identifi in tabl 1 the baselin inventori will includ at least the follow data element for each identifi product use product use identif product use descript lead compound and cas number or form of element lead median lead concentr rang of lead concentr other design factor associ with the level of lead releas from the product the frequenc with which the design of the use product chang and total volum of lead consum annual for the product use these data will serv sever purpos first they will enabl epa to identifi exist use of lead onli signific new use will be subject to regul under section 5 of tsca second these data will improv the agenc understand of exist use and help epa select appropri criteria for effect identifi and control signific new use of lead the agenc invit comment to submit inform of the type describ in the preced paragraph for ani lead contain product use belong to one of the five prioriti use class identifi in tabl 1 for purpos of this notic epa defin a lead contain use product as a use product where lead is intent introduc at ani stage of manufactur or process epa is not current examin use product that contain lead mere as an inadvert contamin epa is also interest in data that comment may possess on human and environment exposur

welcom to submit the inform if they feel that this inform might be use to the agenc data provid by comment will help the agenc to compil a baselin inventori of exist lead contain product and use and

that secondari thrombocytopenia was the princip diagnosi in approxim 4 000 discharg in the 1987 nation hospit discharg survey assum that 10 percent of these thrombocytopenia case were drug induc and 10 percent of drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia case are relat to quinin 40 case could be attribut to quinin assum the popul expos to drug product contain quinin in 1987 was 66 x 106 as calcul

400 000 this wide rang suggest that a precis estim will be hard to obtain it is difficult to conclud howev that the first estim propos by lavi is correct the number of event use by lavi is the number report to fda in 1987 while no one know the extent of underreport it is believ to be veri substanti for exampl if even a 1 percent rate is assum this would translat use lavi other figur to about 1 in 4 000 peopl the exposur estim could also be consider in error lavi assum the drug was use for one quarter of the year by each person if in fact it was use for one half of the year the number of expos peopl would be half that propos and the rate of drug induc immunolog thrombocytopenia would be doubl that calcul the incid calcul base on the nation hospit discharg survey ref 1 employ the estim of

the estim rate would be abov 1 in 10 000 a substanti rate probabl the most credibl of lavi estim is the puget sound base estim ref 2 becaus it is base on hospit diagnos and well document exposur the estim of the incid of qiitp base on the number of document case occur in the popul serv by the blood center of southeastern wisconsin over a 10 year period ref 3 also is base on relat few assumpt and

are similar to the estim of 1 1 000 cite by mitchel ref 4 these three sourc provid a reason small rang for the incid of qiitp that can be expect about 1 1 000 to 1 3 000 therefor while the agenc

that was conduct over a 10 week period in five 2 week interv subject with a histori of at least two cramp per week for at least 3 month were includ in this studi and random to one of two treatment group group i or ii the initi 2 week period was a baselin period and patient who fail to have at least two cramp per week were drop from the studi subject who had a suffici number of cramp dure the baselin period were either given the placebo group i or 325 mg of quinin sulfat per night group ii for a period of 2 week no treatment was given for the next 2 week period and in the fourth 2 week period subject cross over to the altern treatment a final 2 week period of no treatment follow subject were issu week case report form upon which they were instruct to record the number of cramp experienc per night the time of the cramp and the sever of the cramp subject were also ask to rate the effect of the medic just complet at week 4 and 8 of the studi accord to the protocol subject were assign to the treatment sequenc on the basi of a predetermin random schedul prior to enter the baselin period therefor the remov of subject from the studi in the first 2 week for not have enough event may have bias the studi in the statist analysi of the studi data three efficaci variabl were evalu the mean frequenc of leg cramp per night the mean sever of leg cramp per night and the total number of night per week that leg cramp occur the last variabl total number of night per week that leg cramp occur appear to be construct from the primari data becaus no such variabl is list on the week case report form from which these variabl are deriv the subject overal assess of the effect of the drug was collect but not analyz sixti two of the 75 subject enrol in the studi were includ in the data analysi of the 13 subject found to be unevalu 8 withdrew from the studi on their own accord no specif reason for these withdraw were given but it is state in the studi report that they were unrel to the treatment the remain five subject were drop for various medic reason and noncompli with the protocol no intent to treat analysi was perform a number of analys were carri out two of the analys treat the unblind baselin and washout period as if they were treatment period this type of analysi is incorrect for a crossov trial the relev comparison that should be made are between the treatment in the doubl blind period possibl with adjust for baselin provid there are no major chang in baselin valu for each period when patel joint test for equal carryov and equal pretreat sever ref 7 is appli to the data howev signific differ are seen in pretreat sever befor the second period analysi of the second period is thus compromis therefor analysi should be limit to the first treatment period week 3 and 4 this comparison doe not show a signific advantag for quinin sulfat over placebo for ani of the effect variabl anoth clinic studi ref 4 use the same studi design as the studi discuss abov except that the dose of quinin sulfat was 260 mg night not the 325 mg night use in the first studi in addit five efficaci variabl were analyz frequenc sever and durat of leg cramp and induct and qualiti of sleep although the predetermin random chart submit for this studi provid for enrol of 74 subject 84 subject enter the studi no explan for entri of the addit 10 subject was provid as in the first studi random to treatment sequenc occur at the time of entri into the baselin period thus subsequ remov of subject prior to the first doubl blind treatment period may also have introduc bias into this studi of the 84 subject enter at baselin 69 34 assign to group i and 35 to group ii enter the doubl blind treatment phase the studi conclud that signific differ at the 5 percent level exist between quinin sulfat and placebo for three of the five variabl frequenc of cramp induct of sleep and qualiti of sleep howev no document of ani statist analysi support these claim was provid the statist report that accompani the studi address the question of compar the effect of quinin sulfat and placebo with a multivari analysi of covari which compar the vector of efficaci variabl over four observ period two treatment period plus two washout period with the initi baselin valu as a covari the conclus of the analysi was that the treatment effect was not signific p 106 univari analys of covari compar these four observ period were refer to in the statist report but no p valu for treatment effect were provid although a signific order by treatment interact was report also includ in the statist analys of the studi were comparison of the four observ period separ by sequenc quinin sulfat placebo and placebo quinin sulfat which includ baselin adjust mean and comparison between period use duncan multipl rang test these comparison show that signific differ were demonstr between quinin and placebo onli for the placebo quinin sulfat sequenc group ii and onli for three variabl frequenc of cramp qualiti of sleep and induct of sleep howev the adjust mean for the quinin sulfat placebo sequenc group i favor placebo over quinin sulfat for all five efficaci variabl in addit as for the first studi the appropri statist analysi for this type of studi was not done the hypothesi of equal carryov effect was not test and not reject befor ani of the other statist test for treatment effect were perform the result of this studi are not adequ to support the effect of quinin sulfat for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp the studi by jone and castleden ref 5 also doe not provid adequ evid of quinin sulfat effect for this indic the studi was a doubl blind crossov studi of nine patient with four 2 week period of observ a run in period and a washout period in addit to two treatment period of placebo or quinin sulfat 300 mg day the same five efficaci valu as in the second studi abov were evalu frequenc sever and durat of leg cramp and induct and qualiti of sleep no raw data were includ to substanti ani of the statist claim made by the author nor was a protocol includ in the articl of the five primari efficaci variabl onli sever of cramp was claim to show a signific differ between quinin sulfat and placebo p 025 although an analysi of frequenc of cramp after 2 am was also claim to be signific p 025 there was no indic that the time period after 2 am was identifi in the protocol as defin a primari endpoint thus this is assum to be a post hoc analysi done after review the data in general the isol sever find is not convinc on it face in addit the publish articl did not provid suffici inform to permit an independ analysi of the data for these reason the studi doe not provid evid that quinin sulfat is an effect treatment for nocturn leg muscl cramp three studi ref 1 2 and 6 were submit to support the effect of quinin sulfat and vitamin e individu and in combin for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp the freiburg studi ref 1 was a 5 week doubl blind random crossov studi in 24 subject all subject receiv placebo dure week 1 baselin week 3 and week 5 subject in group i receiv quinin in week 2 and the combin of quinin

sulfat was report but no differ in durat or sever of attack was found between these two activ treatment the report describ an obvious improv in frequenc durat and sever of attack between the placebo period and both activ treatment but no statist evid or analysi to support this conclus was provid moreov the comparison of treatment and placebo did not involv random patient group nor was it blind onli the portion of the studi compar the combin product versus quinin was a random doubl blind trial the studi report did not includ the studi protocol detail of the statist analysi conduct or individu subject data the model describ in the summari of the data analysi did not proper separ carryov effect from treatment effect the studi provid no evid from a control trial that quinin is effect

conclud that quinin sulfat alon and in combin with vitamin e at a daili dose of approxim 260 mg was safe and effect in the short term 1 week treatment of nocturn leg muscl cramp the agenc find that there were a number of flaw in the analysi of this studi first the primari endpoint number of night per week with leg cramp appear to have been arbitrarili chosen after the studi was complet none of the efficaci variabl was declar the primari endpoint in the protocol second the studi was of 2 week durat and there was no provis in the protocol for separ evalu of the data from week 1 and week 2 thus there is no basi for the decis to analyz week 1 and week 2 separ in the absenc of such an analysi declar prospect in the protocol in fact an analysi of both week togeth see below doe not show a signific benefit of quinin third an adjust for multipl comparison should have been includ in the data analysi given seven variabl two activ treatment and at least three time point at which data could be analyz first week second week both week the nomin signific differ between treatment at the end of week one would not be expect to retain statist signific if an adjust for multipl comparison were includ in the analysi even consid the retrospect identifi primari endpoint a correct for three look week 1 week 2 and togeth would at least doubl the nomin p valu even without correct for multipl the result do not support the conclus that quinin sulfat and vitamin e alon or in combin are effect for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp first week 2 result fail to replic the result of week 1 no differ between ani of the treatment group for ani paramet were found at the end of week 2 nor was the investig global assess conduct at the end of the 2 week doubl blind period abl to differenti between treatment second a signific treatment by center interact was found for the report superior of quinin sulfat over placebo in week 1 in reduc the number of night per week with leg cramp the result was driven by two of nine center in one of these center the combin product was indistinguish from placebo and in the other the superior of placebo over the combin near statist signific p 10 thus in the two clinic respons for the favor week 1 result of treatment with quinin there was a failur to replic the result report with quinin sulfat alon vitamin e was ineffect in all paramet measur throughout the studi the four retrospect declar secondari endpoint for which statist signific reduct were report in week 1 in the quinin sulfat group compar to placebo were 1 the number

endpoint more persuas as with the primari efficaci endpoint none of the differ between activ treatment and placebo persist through to the end of week 2 for the reason discuss abov the post hoc week 1 analysi of these endpoint fail to provid convinc evid to support the efficaci of quinin sulfat for the treatment and or prevent of nocturn leg muscl cramp two addit analys of the result of the studi were submit ref 8 and 9 the first ref 8 was an analysi of the number of leg cramp per day for each day of the studi this analysi show occasion day in which quinin was superior to placebo but is on the whole not help given an entri cramp rate of one cramp episod per night for at least 3 night per week signific differ in ani endpoint would not be expect on a day by day ie noncumul evalu the second analysi ref 9 was of the total cramp rate mean number of cramp per day over the cours of the entir studi period for both the evalu subset of subject and the intent to treat popul two analys were perform on each group in one analysi onli those subject who complet the studi with at least 14 day of treatment the complet analysi were analyz while the other analysi involv the result from all subject with efficaci observ the endpoint analysi for the quinin sulfat and placebo treatment group in the endpoint analys where less than 14 day of treatment was complet leg cramp for the observ number of day were calcul and the mean was carri forward to 14 day none of the four analys reveal statist signific reduct in the mean number of leg cramp experienc dure 14 day of treatment in the quinin treat subject compar with placebo subject the endpoint analysi for evalu patient approach statist signific for quinin sulfat p 06 but the result of the complet analysi for evalu subject and both intent to treat analys were clear negat the total cramp rate over the entir studi is the most straightforward effect measur it did not show a drug effect on cramp while the favor trend on one

in the studi one group receiv the combin product dure week 2 and quinin sulfat dure week 4 while for the other group this order was revers both group also receiv placebo dure week 3 and 5 both quinin sulfat and the combin of quinin sulfat and vitamin e were report to reduc the frequenc of nocturn leg muscl cramp in this studi a greater reduct in the frequenc of these leg cramp was observ in subject take the combin product compar to subject take quinin alon the differ was report to be statist signific use wilcoxon sign rank test no signific differ were found between treatment for either durat or sever of attack howev as previous discuss see section ic comment 12 the studi report did not includ the studi protocol detail of the statist analysi or individu subject data and the analysi describ doe not proper separ carryov effect from treatment effect therefor it is not possibl to conclud that either treatment use in this studi was effect for this indic the second clinic studi ref 2 was a doubl blind random crossov studi conduct at two site and involv subject with at least a 3 month histori of at least two signific nocturn leg muscl cramp per week the subject did not receiv ani

analysi of pool result from both studi cite were report vitamin e was found to be statist signific superior to placebo in 7 of the 12 efficaci variabl evalu on the basi of the combin data and in 6 of the 12 variabl on the basi of data from at least one of the locat the combin was found to be statist superior to the individu ingredi and placebo on 11 out of the 12 variabl evalu on the basi of both the combin data and data from at least one of the locat on that same basi quinin sulfat was found to be statist superior to placebo in 9 of the 12 variabl evalu and to vitamin e in 1 of the 12 variabl the comment conclud that quinin and vitamin e were signific addit in their effect and that it was this addit effect that result in the high signific superior of the combin over it individu compon the agenc has determin that the statist analysi present with this studi is inadequ for review becaus the model use doe not proper separ the carryov effect from the treatment effect the model consist of a sequenc or code effect a subject within code effect a visit effect and a treatment effect for a given subject this model say that code effect is constant over all visit thus carryov effect must be partial confound with treatment effect therefor the analysi present cannot be reli upon to demonstr the efficaci of ani of the treatment the third clinic studi was a multicent random block parallel

avail toxic data eg inform in data base and other secondari sourc that is use for a preliminari categor of a chemic dure the process of select candid for possibl list under epcra section 313 the toxic screen is use to identifi chemic for further consider and doe not reflect a final determin for list a chemic under epcra section 313 such a determin can onli be made after a hazard assess is conduct see unit ii 3 of this preambl the chemic identifi abov were screen for four general effect categori acut human health effect cancer other chronic human health effect and ecolog effect the screen criteria associ with each of the effect area use in the toxic screen are discuss in detail in the revis draft hazard assess guidelin for list chemic on the toxic releas inventori draft hazard assess guidelin ref 6 the numer screen valu reflect in the draft hazard assess guidelin were develop to captur in the suffici for list screen categori the major of chemic alreadi list on various cercla and epcra list and thus known or suspect to be toxic and or hazard these draft hazard assess guidelin contain guidanc for both the screen and hazard assess of chemic and are avail for review in the docket associ with this rulemak this draft document was distribut at a public meet on may 29 1992 a final version of these guidelin has not yet been develop request for further inform about these draft guidelin should be address to the person identifi under for further inform contact base on the result of this screen the chemic were preliminarili place in one of three screen categori defin in the draft hazard assess guidelin suffici may be suffici or insuffici epa receiv comment in respons to the draft hazard assess guidelin that object to the agenc use of the term suffici may be suffici and insuffici as titl for the toxic screen categori the comment claim that these term are appropri onli for the result of a hazard assess the comment state that these term should not be use for screen categori becaus the toxic screen onli identifi chemic for further consider epa agre that the screen categori onli reflect a preliminari determin on each chemic and therefor to avoid further confus will refer to the screen categori as high prioriti medium prioriti and low prioriti to reflect the differ between a toxic screen and a hazard assess these term will be use throughout this document in refer to the toxic screen categori chemic that were categor as low prioriti dure the screen process were not consid further as candid for addit to the epcra section 313 list in this rulemak 2 product volum screen epcra section 313 f establish report threshold relat to the amount of a chemic that is manufactur process or otherwis use the epcra section 313 manufactur includ import and process threshold are 25 000 pound per facil per year the otherwis use threshold is 10 000 pound per facil per year epa anticip that the addit of chemic manufactur import process or use in quantiti less than the epcra section 313 volum threshold would not result in the submiss of tri report thus epa elect to initi focus it attent on chemic like to yield report accord epa also screen potenti candid for the likelihood of meet the epcra section 313 volum threshold chemic for which there were no data to indic that the chemic is like to meet or exceed the epcra section 313 volum threshold were not consid further as possibl candid for addit to the section 313 list at this time product volum data on each of the chemic were gather primarili from two sourc 1 the tsca chemic updat system 1990 and 2 the fifra section 7 track system on june 12 1986 51 fr 21438 epa promulg a rule pursuant to section 8 a of tsca which requir manufactur and import to report everi 4 year subject to certain threshold

the abov analys and determin base on the weight of the evid if there was suffici evid to establish that the candid chemic met the statutori criteria for addit to epcra section 313 to make this determin epa senior scientist review readili avail toxic inform on each chemic for each of the follow effect area acut human health effect cancer other chronic human effect and environment effect in addit epa review where appropri inform on the environment fate of the chemic the hazard assess was conduct in accord with relev epa guidelin for each advers human health or environment effect eg the appropri guidelin for hazard evalu of chemic carcinogen and for the type of evid requir to substanti a determin of carcinogen are the guidelin for carcinogen risk assess ref 2 the guidelin that were use for each effect are agenc guidelin that are identifi in the draft hazard assess guidelin ref 6 dure this assess the sever and signific of the effect induc by the chemic the dose level caus the effect and the qualiti and quantiti of the avail data includ the natur of the data eg human epidemiolog laboratori anim field or workplac studi and confid level in the exist data base were all consid where a care review of the scientif data for a particular chemic result in a high level of confid that the chemic caus an advers effect at relat low dose level epa believ that this evid is suffici for list the chemic under section 313 on the other hand where a review of the scientif data indic that the chemic will caus various advers effect at moder dose level epa believ base on the total weight of the evid that there is suffici evid for list the chemic under epcra section 313 epa also conduct an analysi of exposur for each chemic or chemic categori propos for list under epcra section 313 d 2 a ie base on advers acut human health effect and where appropri under section 313 d 2 c ie base on advers ecolog effect for chemic list under epcra section 313 d 2 a this analysi includ estim concentr of the chemic at or beyond the facil site boundari through the use of estim releas and model techniqu epa request comment on it approach in consid exposur as a part of it evalu of these chemic under section 313 d 2 a and c base on this analysi for each of the chemic propos for list epa determin that one or more of the statutori criteria were met a discuss of epa interpret of the epcra section 313 criteria is given in unit iii of this preambl a discuss of the evid support epa propos to add each of the chemic to epcra section 313 is present in unit iv of this preambl and in the record support this propos rule 4 other consider epa exclud certain chemic and chemic categori from consider for propos list under epcra section 313 in this rulemak for a number of reason some chemic were identifi onli as environment degrad product rather than chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use by a facil these chemic will onli be present in the environ as a result of the releas into the environ of precursor chemic if the degrad product meet the toxic criteria of epcra section 313 the precursor chemic may be consid for list on epcra section 313 the degrad product would not be consid for list on epcra section 313 becaus a facil subject to epcra section 313 is onli requir to file a tri report for a chemic that it manufactur process or otherwis use within the facil boundari therefor epa doe not believ that it is appropri to consid list such chemic at this time some of the list review by epa includ list that repres wast stream from particular process these wast stream such as coke oven emiss are not discret chemic or chemic categori but contain a wide rang of chemic mani of which are current list individu on epcra section 313 the focus of this rulemak is on the addit of specif chemic and chemic categori and as such epa believ that these wast stream are inappropri for list under epcra section 313 at this time epa also exclud chemic whose onli identifi toxic concern was a result of their status as a volatil organ compound voc voc contribut to the format of tropospher ozon which caus a number of health relat and environment problem epa continu to believ that voc meet the list criteria of epcra section 313 howev epa intend to address the issu of how voc should be list on epcra section 313 separ therefor chemic whose onli identifi toxic concern is due to their status as voc were exclud from consider at this time epa also identifi chemic that are routin manufactur process or otherwis use at level far below the report threshold of epcra section 313 these chemic are not expect to ever be manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti at or abov these report threshold in this propos rulemak epa is attempt to add chemic to epcra section 313 that are manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti greater than the epcra section 313 volum threshold and thus would result in the submiss of tri report consequ chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use in quantiti less than the epcra section 313 volum threshold were exclud from further consider at this time becaus no report would be file under epcra section 313 for such chemic some of the chemic that are manufactur process or otherwis use below the epcra section 313 activ threshold particular those chemic that are manufactur in trace amount in wast stream are high toxic at veri low dose level and have physic chemic or biolog properti that make the chemic persist for extend period in the environ and bioaccumul through the food chain persist bioaccumul toxic chemic such as dioxin are of particular concern in ecosystem such as the great lake basin due to the long retent time of the individu lake and the cycl of the chemic from one compon of the ecosystem to anoth epa may reconsid in the futur the issu of list such chemic in a manner which would result in the submiss of tri report epa request comment on the follow is it appropri to list such chemic on epcra section 313 if epa were to add this type of chemic to epcra section 313 what modif to epcra section 313 such as lower the report threshold and modifi the de minimi in mixtur exempt 40 cfr part 372 38 would be requir to insur that releas and transfer inform would be collect iii epcra section 313 statutori criteria epcra section 313 d 2 set out criteria for ad chemic to the list of chemic subject to report under section 313 a for a chemic or categori of chemic to be ad to the epcra section 313 c list of toxic chemic the administr must determin whether in her judgement there is suffici evid to establish ani one of the follow a the chemic is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus signific advers acut human health effect at concentr level that are reason like to exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas b the chemic is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus in human i cancer or teratogen effect or ii serious or irrevers i reproduct dysfunct ii neurolog disord iii herit genet mutat or iv other chronic health effect c the chemic is known to caus or can reason be anticip to caus becaus of i it toxic ii it toxic and persist in the environ or iii it toxic and tendenc to bioaccumul in the environ a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgement of the administr to warrant report under this section to remov a chemic from the section 313 c list the administr must determin that there is not suffici evid to establish ani of the criteria describ abov as requir by epcra section 313 d 3 thus the criteria for list or delist a chemic are ident howev wherea epa can add a chemic if onli one of the criteria is met it can onli delet a chemic if none of the criteria are met to ascertain whether there is suffici or insuffici evid to determin that the statutori criteria are met for list a chemic epa conduct a hazard assess on the chemic and determin base on the weight of the evid whether the chemic can reason be anticip to caus ani of the advers effect specifi in epcra section 313 d 2 the hazard analysi is describ abov in unit ii 3 of this preambl epa interpret of the specif statutori criteria follow 1 section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect to determin whether the section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect criterion is met epa must examin the advers effect associ with the chemic the concentr level which would caus acut human health effect and the likelihood of such level exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas such a determin may includ among other factor consider of product process workplac procedur pollut control and the volum and pattern of product use and releas as well as other chemic specif factor epa believ that to make the section 313 d 2 a determin it must demonstr that a chemic can reason be anticip to be releas in quantiti that result in concentr level or within a reason margin of exposur of the concentr level that would be expect to caus acut human health effect beyond the facil site boundari the margin of exposur appli is depend upon the type of hazard data eg data in anim versus human and the confid in this hazard data base for acut effect eg suffici of the hazard data howev epa is not requir to make a facil specif find nor is it necessari for epa to demonstr that these concentr level or effect occur at or near ani particular facil ref 1 furthermor epa may but is not requir to conduct new studi or risk assess or perform site specif analys to establish actual ambient concentr or to document advers effect at ani particular locat ref 1 nor is epa limit to consid concentr level and potenti acut human health effect at the fencelin rather the phrase beyond facil site boundari reflect congress recognit that the highest concentr to which person outsid the site boundari may be expos could occur at ani point outsid the boundari of the site on which the facil is locat includ for exampl where an air emiss plume cool and settl to the ground ref 1 therefor epa believ that to make a find under epcra section 313 d 2 a the agenc may estim concentr at or beyond the facil site boundari through the use of estim releas and model techniqu the term continu or frequent recur releas is includ onli to distinguish routin releas that are a normal consequ of the oper of a facil from the episod and accident releas that are subject to epcra section 304 ref 1 as such epa believ that episod and accident releas are not pertin in a determin that a chemic meet the section 313 d 2 a criterion 2 section 313 d 2 b chronic human health effect in contrast to the section 313 d 2 a criterion section 313 d 2 b doe not requir consider of either the natur and frequenc of releas or concentr level at facil site boundari rather section 313 d 2 b is focus sole on whether the chemic is known or can reason be anticip to caus cancer teratogen or other serious or irrevers chronic human health effect consequ epa believ that it is suffici to consid onli the toxic of the subject chemic to make the section 313 d 2 b determin 3 section 313 d 2 c environment effect the section 313 d 2 c criterion requir epa to consid a chemic potenti to caus signific advers effect on the environ the statut direct epa to base it determin on a consider of the toxic of the chemic either alon or in combin with the persist of the chemic or the potenti for the chemic to bioaccumul congress intend that epa consid a broad rang of environment effect when make a determin under section 313 d 2 c in determin what constitut a signific advers effect on the environ the administr should consid the extent to which the toxic chemic caus or can reason be anticip to caus ani of the follow advers reaction even if restrict to the immedi vicin adjac to the site 1 gradual or sudden chang in the composit of anim life or plant life includ fungal or microbi organ in an area 2 abnorm number of death of organ eg fish kill 3 reduct of the reproduct success or the vigor of a speci 4 reduct in agricultur product whether crop or livestock 5 alter in the behavior or distribut of a speci 6 long last or irrevers contamin of compon of the physic environ especi in the case of groundwat and surfac water and soil resourc that have limit self cleans capabl ref 1 epa believ that the environment effect criterion inher contain a limit exposur compon becaus of the statutori requir for epa to find a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgment of the administr to warrant report under epcra section 313 unlik section 313 d 2 b where epa onli has to determin whether certain kind of effect are known or reason anticip to occur section 313 d 2 c requir epa to find the effect to be of suffici serious to warrant report which impli the possibl that under certain circumst a chemic that could theoret caus a signific advers effect on the environ is unlik to caus one of a magnitud to warrant list the extent to which exposur is factor into epa determin depend upon the inher toxic of a chemic and a varieti of other chemic specif characterist epa believ that when a chemic is inher extrem toxic that is it is toxic at veri low dose level an exposur assess is not necessari becaus even minim releas of such a chemic may reason be anticip to result in signific advers environment effect in such case epa could reli on toxic alon under section 313 d 2 c i as a basi for list howev for chemic that exhibit advers effect upon the environ sole base on toxic at moder low dose epa believ that consider of potenti exposur is warrant becaus minim releas may not result in signific advers effect upon the environ these exposur consider may includ among other factor pollut control the volum and pattern of product use and releas environment fate as well as other chemic specif factor and the use of estim releas and model techniqu epcra section 313 d 2 c ii and iii allow epa to consid the impact of other characterist of a chemic where a chemic exhibit signific advers effect in the environ base on toxic and persist or toxic and bioaccumul at veri low to moder low dose level epa believ that exposur consider are not requir in addit to those consider implicit in evalu of the chemic potenti for persist and bioaccumul this is becaus even minim releas of the chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ or in an organ that can reason be anticip to result in signific advers effect this reflect the increas likelihood that there will be exposur to a chemic that persist due to it longer resid time in the environ repeat minim releas of a persist chemic may result in elev concentr in the environ for a chemic that bioaccumul even low level of the chemic in the environ may result in increas concentr in an organ therefor evalu of a chemic persist or bioaccumul potenti may be consid the function equival of an exposur analysi in addit for chemic which induc well establish advers effect eg chlorofluorocarbon which caus stratospher ozon deplet epa believ that an exposur assess is unnecessari epa believ that these chemic typic do not affect sole one or two speci but rather affect chang across a whole ecosystem epa believ that these effect are of suffici serious that addit exposur consider are not warrant becaus of the scope of their impact and the well document evid support the advers effect epa request comment on it approach for consid exposur as a part of it evalu for list of these chemic under section 313 d 2 c in unit iv b of this preambl epa identifi each of the chemic propos for addit to epcra section 313 and the specif statutori criteria upon which the propos addit is base iv epa technic review a introduct data on the chemic and chemic categori were review for evid indic advers acut and chronic toxic carcinogen mutagen development and reproduct effect neurotox and environment effect inform on the environment fate was also review for each chemic propos for addit to epcra section 313 in this rulemak epa conduct an extens hazard assess and where appropri an analysi of exposur to determin whether the chemic met one or more of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria this hazard assess is discuss in detail in unit ii 3 of this preambl onli after this care review was a final determin made as to whether one of the epcra section 313 d 2 list criteria was met for each individu chemic or chemic categori propos for list below epa need onli show that one of the list criteria is met in order to list a chemic or chemic categori under epcra section 313 the inform summar below for each chemic or chemic categori repres the key data element that lead epa to believ that there is suffici evid to establish that one of the section 313 d 2 list criteria is met a more extens review of the exist data base for each chemic or chemic categori propos for list which reflect the entir weight of the evid consid by epa is contain in follow support document support document for the addit of

to dietari supplement until decemb 15 1993 the ds act provid that by june 15 1993 fda was to have issu propos rule to implement the 1990 amend with respect to dietari supplement and that by decemb 31 1993 the agenc is to issu final rule base on these propos the ds act also amend the 1990 amend to reflect the fact that if the agenc doe not issu final rule with respect to health claim for dietari supplement by decemb 31 1993 the propos regul are to be consid final regul at that time in the feder regist of june 18 1993 58 fr 33700 fda respond to the ds act by issu a propos that set forth a standard and procedur for make health claim for dietari supplement hereinaft refer to as the dietari supplement health claim propos in that propos fda propos to make health claim on dietari supplement subject to the same general requir that appli to health claim on all other type of food in respons to the dietari supplement health claim propos fda receiv over 1 200 letter each contain one or more comment from consum health care profession univers state and local govern trade organ consum advocaci organ research institut industri and profession organ some comment agre with one or more provis of the propos rule without provid further ground for support other than those provid by fda in the preambl to the propos other comment disagre with one or more provis of the propos without provid specif ground for their disagr mani comment address issu that are beyond the scope of these regul and will not be address in this document for exampl some respond to various aspect of fdas june 18 1993 advanc notic of propos rulemak concern the general regul of dietari supplement 58 fr 33690 most of the comment howev address the propos regul and provid specif ground in support of their posit the agenc has summar and address the issu rais in the comment in the discuss that follow ii regulatori approach a general approach base on fdas review of the 1990 amend the 1990 amend did not provid a specif standard for when a health claim should be author on dietari supplement or a specif procedur for author such claim under section 403 r 5 d of the act the establish of such a standard and such a procedur is left to the secretari of the us depart of health and human servic dhhs and by deleg fda thus in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33702 fda review the legisl histori of the 1990 amend to identifi the featur that congress intend would guid the agenc choic of a scientif standard and procedur for regul health claim on dietari supplement fda identifi the follow featur that it believ should guid it choic o the regul are to deal onli with the procedur and standard for health claim for the substanc in dietari supplement they are to have no bear on the avail of ani dietari supplement o the regul must prohibit the use of health claim that are not author under their provis o the regul must ensur that ani health claim that appear in label are scientif valid o the regul must ensur that ani health claim that appear in label are understand o the regul should be such that all segment of the food industri are treat fair and in a consist manner unless there is an appropri basi on which to draw a distinct this factor embodi a principl of equiti implicit in the act 58 fr 33700 at 33703 with these featur in mind fda consid all of the approach of which it was awar that might be use to regul dietari supplement the agenc tentat conclud that it should adopt an approach that would subject dietari supplement to the same standard that appli to food in convent food form fda state that it was it tentat view that that approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other furthermor the agenc advis that if it adopt this standard for dietari supplement all food will be regul under the same standard fda point out that under the same procedur that appli with respect to claim for substanc in food in convent food form there is a premarket review that ensur that the safeti of the substanc that is to be the subject of the claim has been establish as well as the scientif valid of the claim a claim link a substanc to a diseas whether on a food in convent food form or on a dietari supplement is intend to increas intak of that substanc thus the agenc said it is import to ensur that a claim encourag such increas intak can be safe implement therefor fda propos to adopt the same procedur for health claim for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form 1 avail of dietari supplement 1 a great mani comment primarili from consum rais object that indic that the comment were misinform about the propos regul or that they simpli did not believ what fda state in the dietari supplement propos mani of the comment express consider anger resent and even fear over the propos a larg number of these comment character the propos as an attack against the dietari supplement industri mani of these comment state that fda is plot to ban all dietari supplement a number of comment explain that the propos regul would limit the number of dietari supplement avail to consum by limit the amount of health inform that could appear on supplement label and thus diminish supplement market the comment maintain that fdas propos polici of requir premarket review of a supplement safeti is contrari to the agenc state intent to preserv supplement avail and consum choic some of the comment maintain that mani manufactur would be put out of busi mani of the comment argu that the nation health would be advers affect and that health care cost would increas without dietari supplement to maintain good health some comment contain testimoni that certain dietari supplement were respons for cure and prevent a varieti of diseas includ cancer howev a few comment point out that assert that fda plan to ban dietari supplement are unfound a number of these comment predict that the vast major of dietari supplement will remain in the marketplac becaus about 80 percent of supplement label are alreadi in complianc with the propos provis there is no basi for virtual all of the concern rais in the comment about the avail of dietari supplement noth in these regul will make them unavail to consum these regul focus onli on ensur that health claim if made on the label or in the label of dietari supplement are scientif valid and understand thus the avail of dietari supplement will not be affect by these regul while it is like that some claim may have to be remov from product label as a result of this final rule the product themselv can continu to be market it is true that prohibit the use of claim that have not been author by fda may have an advers impact on the market of some product howev ani such impact is outweigh by the need to assur consum that the claim that are made in label are scientif valid and that they can reli on such claim in fact the onli product whose market will ultim suffer under these regul will be those whose label has born claim that cannot be support by the avail scientif evid the requir that the agenc be confid that the presenc of a health claim will not result in unsaf intak of the substanc that is the subject of the claim is not inconsist with supplement avail and consum choic if a manufactur doe not choos to make a claim about a substanc noth in these regul will affect the manufactur abil to continu to market supplement that contain that substanc fda believ howev that it has an oblig to ensur that befor it author a claim that encourag consum to increas their consumpt of a substanc it have some assur that increas consumpt of that substanc will not be harm 2 fair and consist treatment of all segment of the food industri 2 mani comment assert that fda has not been evenhand in it approv of health claim for use on dietari supplement and on food in convent food form some of these comment maintain that fdas unfair treatment of dietari supplement is evidenc by the agenc approv of health claim involv cancer and coronari heart diseas for use on fruit veget and grain product but not for use on fortifi food or supplement that provid fiber or antioxid vitamin the comment state that fda should author health claim involv particular nutrient for use on ani food that contain those nutrient includ dietari supplement unless there is signific scientif agreement that the claim is valid onli when the nutrient is consum in a particular form to ensur that such an approach is taken in evalu health claim for use on dietari supplement in the futur a few comment request that fda add the follow provis to the end of 101 14 g 21 cfr 101 14 g a health claim that has been approv for ani substanc that is to be consum at other than decreas dietari level shall be permit on all food includ dietari supplement contain the requisit amount of that substanc unless fda determin that i there is signific scientif agreement as defin in subparagraph c that the consumpt of the substanc in the particular food will not provid the benefit claim or ii the food contain disqualifi amount of anoth substanc a few comment contend that fda also has treat dietari supplement unfair by withhold approv of a health claim concern the role of folic acid in reduc the risk of neural tube defect ntds simpli becaus of it concern that allow the claim on food in convent food form would rais safeti issu becaus of overfortif of the food suppli and the subsequ effect on certain subpopul these comment assert that the proper cours of action for the agenc would have been to allow health claim on dietari supplement but to prohibit their use on food in convent food form until the public health concern associ with such use had been resolv howev a few comment support fdas decis to approv particular health claim for use on fruit veget and fiber contain grain while not author their use on dietari supplement or fortifi food with ad antioxid vitamin or fiber these comment note that there are mani compound in fruit and veget that may be involv in reduc the risk of diseas that may not have been identifi the comment assert that befor allow a dietari supplement to bear a health claim author for use on food in convent food form it is import to establish that the supplement provid the same health protect benefit as the convent food fda disagre with the assert in the comment that it has been unfair with the dietari supplement industri with respect to it approv of specif health claim fda believ that the health claim should be consist with the scientif evid avail to the agenc in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2537 2552 and 2622 fda explain whi it was author health claim pertain to 1 heart diseas and diet low in satur fat and cholesterol and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber 2 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber and 3 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that may contain fiber vitamin a beta caroten and vitamin c the agenc also explain in detail whi it was not author health claim pertain to ani specif nutrient ie heart diseas and dietari fiber cancer and dietari fiber and cancer and antioxid vitamin in the case of the antioxid vitamin fda found that although there was suffici evid to justifi a health claim concern the relationship between diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that may contain fiber vitamin a and vitamin c and a reduc risk of cancer the avail evid did not provid a basi on which to attribut the reduct in risk of diseas to ani individu vitamin or combin of vitamin regardless of whether the vitamin is classifi as an antioxid or not see discuss under section iv 58 fr 2622 at 2633 yet becaus of the use of vitamin a as beta caroten and c and dietari fiber in identifi those fruit and veget that correl with reduc cancer risk fda identifi these nutrient as be characterist of the food associ with a protect effect ani one or a combin of these three nutrient can serv as the identifi marker moreov becaus fruit and veget are also character by an absenc of fat and becaus of the identifi relationship of low fat diet to reduc risk of cancer fda highlight low fat intak as part of the dietari pattern associ with decreas cancer risk becaus the mechan of the protect effect of fruit and veget is not known and becaus it is not possibl to determin which of the nutrient or other compon in fruit and veget is caus the observ effect the health claim author by fda focus on fruit and veget as a class of food and their relationship to cancer risk and not on particular nutrient by requir that all character nutrient be identifi as characterist of dietari pattern rich in fruit and veget without specif attribut reduc cancer risk to a singl nutrient or singl type of nutrient antioxid vitamin fda made the claim consist with the scientif knowledg avail to it at the time it author the claim becaus of the rapid evolv scienc base relat to this topic howev fda has continu to updat it evalu of the scientif evid and the degre of scientif agreement on the relationship between antioxid vitamin and cancer as part of these effort fda initi along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public confer on antioxid vitamin and cancer and cardiovascular diseas that was held on novemb 1 through 3 1993 the transcript of that meet has been submit to the docket as a comment on the antioxid vitamin and cancer rulemak along with other comment receiv in respons to the announc of the confer 58 fr 54595 octob 22 1993 fda is review the result of this confer and other scientif evid that has becom public avail sinc the public of the januari 6 1993 final rule on antioxid vitamin and cancer similar in the case of heart diseas and dietari fiber and of cancer and dietari fiber the agenc found that there was insuffici evid to attribut the reduct in risk specif to dietari fiber or to specif fiber compon the agenc did conclud howev that dietari fiber and solubl fiber along with other nutrient serv as use marker in identifi those food for which the scientif evid show that inclus in a daili diet was associ with reduc risk of cancer and of heart diseas 58 fr 2552 and 58 fr 2537 for both topic area the agenc also note the inabl of common use analyt methodolog to detect mani of the characterist that vari among dietari fiber and that may be relat to biolog function eg particl size chemic composit water hold capac with regard to heart diseas other compon variabl associ with solubl fiber in food eg lipid compon may also contribut to a cholesterol lower effect fda found that the inabl to detect mani of the differ among fiber fiber compon and other substanc in food that contain dietari fiber includ solubl fiber and the general lack of conclus as to the mechan of action of dietari fiber and fiber compon were limit factor on fdas abil to draw conclus from the avail evid furthermor fda note that food high in dietari fiber are also general low in calori and total fat factor that are associ with reduc risk of cancer fiber rich food are also general low in satur fat and cholesterol substanc that also affect the risk of develop heart diseas thus some or all of the benefit associ with diet high in fiber rich food could be the result of displac of fat and satur fat from the total diet rather than an effect of fiber per se the agenc state that although the specif role of the numer potenti protect substanc or displac of negat substanc eg fat satur fat and cholesterol in such plant food are not yet understood popul with diet rich in these food experi mani health advantag includ lower rate of heart diseas and cancer thus fda did not author the use of a health claim on the associ between ingest of dietari fiber or specif fiber compon and a reduc risk of heart diseas or cancer instead for cancer fda to be consist with the avail scientif evid and prevail scientif agreement focus on fiber contain grain product fruit and veget as product class similar for heart diseas fda focus on fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber particular solubl fiber becaus of the use of dietari fiber or solubl fiber in identifi the type of food whose consumpt is most like to correl with decreas cancer or heart diseas risk these substanc can serv as identifi marker for select use food even in the absenc of adequ evid of a direct effect of fiber fda is awar howev of the rapid evolv natur of the scienc base relat to these topic area fda intend to updat it review of the scienc by initi in the near futur along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public symposium on dietari fiber and heart diseas and cancer with respect to assert concern folic acid fda disagre that it should have allow health claim on dietari supplement while prohibit their use on food in convent food form while fda did not author a health claim for folic acid and ntds in the final rule on heath claim and label statement for folic acid and ntds publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2606 hereinaft refer to as the folic acid final rule the agenc did announc it plan to work expediti to author a claim if appropri the agenc note that the public health servic phs includ fda had recommend ref 7 that all women of childbear age in the unit state should consum 04 milligram mg 400 microgram g of folic acid daili to reduc their risk of have a pregnanc affect with spina bifida or other neural tube defect fda acknowledg that this recommend evidenc that signific scientif agreement exist regard a relationship between folat and ntds but said that there were factor that prevent fda from author a claim the agenc said that the act must be read as a whole and that section 403 r 3 a ii and 409 of the act 21 usc 348 reflect the proposit that the use of a substanc that is the subject of a health claim must be safe the agenc point out that the phs recommend state that there were signific question that persist about the safe use of folic acid in food as state in the folic acid final rule fda expect that the author of a claim would like result in signific increas in consumpt of folic acid by women in their childbear year and by the general popul becaus manufactur would add folic acid to their product in order to claim that these product were use in reduc the risk of birth defect intak of multipl dose of folic acid from supplement and from it increas presenc in the food suppli could rapid result in intak of 3 to 7 mg 3 000 to 7 000 g per day 58 fr 2606 at 2614 such intak repres increas of 10 fold or more abov current intak in the folic acid final rule the agenc review the safeti consider rais by such increas in folic acid intak includ 1 potenti effect in person with poor vitamin b12 status 2 potenti risk for person take medic that interfer with folat metabol 3 potenti risk for pregnant women becaus of uncertainti about effect of high blood level of folic acid on the embryo dure gestat and 4 uncertainti regard possibl interact between folic acid and other nutrient with increas folic acid intak the agenc conclud that it could not author a health claim on folic acid until the question regard the safe use of this nutrient were satisfactorili resolv in the folic acid final rule the agenc describ the effort it was undertak to address and resolv these concern follow public of this document base on it review of the evid it discuss with an advisori committe and it review of the comment that it receiv the agenc tentat conclud that the safeti problem rais by folic acid can be resolv by set a safe upper limit of intak of 1 mg folat per day for all popul group the agenc announc it tentat conclus in a propos to author a health claim on folat and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 octob 14 1993 in companion document fda also propos to amend the food addit regul for folic acid to specifi the food that could be fortifi with folic acid and the level at which they could be fortifi 58 fr 53312 and to amend the standard of ident for specif cereal grain product to permit the addit of folic acid 58 fr 53305 thus base on this review of the agenc action it is clear that the nondiscriminatori provis suggest in the comment is not necessari when fda has conclud that a substanc has a relationship to a diseas fda has act to author a claim see final rule on calcium and osteoporosi 58 fr 2665 and the propos rule on folic acid and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 in the case of antioxid vitamin and cancer dietari fiber and heart diseas and dietari fiber and cancer the evid did not establish that the name substanc had an effect on the name diseas the evid show that these nutrient were mere marker of food that had been shown in studi to affect the risk of the diseas fda has reflect the scientif evid in the claim that it has author and propos to author ani other cours of action would be inconsist with the act becaus it would result in claim that were both not scientif valid and mislead b altern approach in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 fda advis that a varieti of approach had come to fdas attent about how health claim for dietari supplement would best be regul under the 1990 amend these approach came to the agenc attent by various mean includ the comment on the health claim propos that address the most appropri method for regul dietari supplement testimoni befor congress about implement of the 1990 amend as well as the legisl histori of the 1990 amend fda care evalu each of these approach to determin how they compar with the characterist that fda has list abov a number of comment address the agenc tentat conclus about these approach 1 use of advisori committe in the dietari supplement health claim propos see section ii 1 58 fr 33700 at 33704 fda advis that it had tentat decid not to adopt a committe base approach suggest in comment for evalu the valid of health claim on herb this approach known as the botan ingredi review bir would involv the establish of expert panel under the direct of an oversight committe fda would particip as a nonvot member of the expert panel the oversight committe which would be charg with the respons of review all health claim petit pertain to herb or botan compon would reliev fda of all respons for initi review of these petit each expert panel would conduct an evalu of scientif data pertain to the request claim subject the evalu to peer review and prepar a final recommend about the claim the recommend and all support document would then be forward to fda and the agenc would be permit 120 day to approv disapprov or modifi the report under draft regul prepar and submit for fda adopt by one comment on the health claim propos there would be a codifi presumpt in favor of the committe recommend the agenc base it tentat decis about the bir on it belief that the suggest approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author on health claim becaus of this presumpt in the draft regul submit by the comment under this presumpt fda would be oblig to prove that the committe was wrong if the agenc decid not to follow the committe recommend in such circumst fda could be forc to propos to author health claim that it was not satisfi were scientif valid fda note that there is no basi under the act for such a transfer also the agenc note that the creation of such a committe would be financi burdensom and state that it would be inappropri to commit it limit resourc to a committe with as narrow a scope as that suggest by the comment 3 a few comment address this advisori committe issu some comment voic opposit to fdas tentat decis not to establish a bir these comment disput the agenc assert that the establish of a bir would involv ani transfer of author note that fda would retain full and final discret in approv health claim the comment also disput fdas find that the creation of a bir would be burdensom and cost in light of the agenc limit resourc the comment state that such a find is inconsist with fdas current use of advisori committe for veri narrow subject matter such as over the counter otc antiplaqu product circulatori system medic devic and drug abus the comment state that the use of a bir to help screen petit from the much larger herbal product industri would be an effici econom and scientif credibl way to ration fdas scarc resourc and would also help fda meet statutorili impos deadlin for action on petit that it might not otherwis be abl to meet the comment also assert that the agenc statement that it has the ultim respons to determin whether the petit for health claim is valid impli a mistrust of the integr of the bir process and the involv scientist and reveal an agenc belief that it is the onli author compet to judg the scientif valid of health claim for herbal dietari supplement the comment disagre with such a conclus and argu that health claim petit will onli receiv adequ and full consider from the scientif communiti best qualifi to determin whether they meet the signific scientif agreement standard set by congress through the creation of a bir which would repres the most compet and knowledg bodi in a field that remain larg esoter to fda one of these comment suggest that appropri select for herbal expert panel might includ experienc herbal practition who are familiar with potenti advers reaction to herb as well as medic practition in foreign countri where herb safeti has been studi by govern and industri panel the comment state that the inclus of foreign medic practition would be especi appropri dure the evalu of a claim whose merit are agre upon throughout the world but are not general recogn in the unit state such as in the case of use peppermint tea for it sooth or carmin effect on the digest tract howev one comment support the agenc tentat decis not to adopt the bir process the comment state that fda could well be legal liabl for decis made by the bir that were later shown to have place the public health at risk sever comment call for fda to establish an advisori committe for health claim for dietari supplement where the committe would select expert panel respons for the evalu of propos health claim for all dietari supplement the comment suggest that the expert panel should be compos of scientist and health care profession with expertis on a given nutrient diseas relationship as well as nonvot industri and consum repres these comment contend that one reason for the agenc slow in approv a health claim for folic acid has been it relianc on advisori panel that were not suffici familiar with the research in the area and who had to be educ about the strength of the evid befor they could act some of these comment suggest that fda could retain the author to reject the recommend of the committe as long as it publish it reason for do so anoth comment state that both the dietari supplement industri and fda have been slow to recogn and util a great deal of research that has been done in the area of nutrit and health the comment attribut this slow to a gap between the scientif communiti fda and the dietari supplement industri the comment suggest that in order to close this gap fda should form a committe of it lead scientist to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month or as requir to discuss the latest research in the area of nutrit and health publish in high accredit scientif journal so that the research could be use to creat and support health claim petit the comment suggest that when the agenc committe and the industri reach an agreement on the data fda could author the use of a health claim on the nutrient diseas relationship on which there is agreement fda recogn that advisori committe may make valuabl contribut in assist the agenc to evalu scientif evid about health claim in certain circumst for exampl the folic acid subcommitte of the food advisori committe provid valuabl recommend in support of fda propos to author a health claim for folic acid and propos to fortifi cereal grain product the agenc intend to continu it use of advisori committe wherev the need aris fda believ howev that it should retain the right to decid when the use of an advisori committe is necessari there may frequent be circumst in which evid establish that use of advisori committe is not necessari becaus the evid show that the claim is clear support or clear not support in addit if the agenc were to establish a stand advisori committe for health claim fda would want it to have a broader focus than just dietari supplement fdas view is that claim should focus on the substanc and not the food in which it is found becaus the primari issu is whether the substanc diseas relationship has been establish thus if fda were to establish a stand advisori committe it would be on health claim in general although a number of comment assert that fda lack knowledg of herbal product the agenc believ that it personnel are fulli compet to evalu proper substanti petit concern health claim in this area also if the agenc were to decid to establish an advisori committe it would take step to ensur that the membership of the committe had the necessari expertis includ pertin expertis on herbal product there is an implic in some of the comment that the evalu of the scientif evid support a claim is somehow differ depend on the substanc involv in fact whether a claim is for a vitamin miner herb or other similar nutrit substanc includ fat satur fat and cholesterol the skill need for evalu of a claim are basic the same these skill are found in epidemiologist nutritionist biostatistician clinician and expert in the diseas be address as well as in peopl awar of how the substanc is or should be consum thus fda doe not agre with the implic in these comment fda is interest in have communic with the dietari supplement industri howev the agenc doe not believ that it would be appropri for the communic to take the form of the suggest stand committe to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month while fda believ that regular communic with the dietari supplement industri is like to be use the process by which health claim are author must be a more open and public process than that suggest by the comment certain the 1990 amend envis a public process for claim for substanc in food in convent food form as reflect in section 403 r 4 of the act fda has been present with no convinc reason whi a similar process should not appli to claim for substanc in dietari supplement furthermor fda continu to believ that the bir advisori committe approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author for health claim even though comment on the health claim propos and the dietari supplement health claim propos have made argument to the contrari the suggest regul for health claim that was submit to fda on may 10 1991 and refer to by the agenc in the propos that it has issu state in part b if the committe determin that a propos health claim is appropri for a particular herb or botan either as propos or as modifi by the committe it shall forward it recommend s to fda togeth with all the data and other inform befor the committe when it made it decis c if the committe determin that on the basi of the data and other inform befor it the propos health claim is not scientif justifi for the herb or botan it shall so notifi the propos the propos may then direct the committe to forward to fda all the inform befor the committe with respect to the propos togeth with it conclus and the reason therefor d within 120 day of receipt of the inform describ in b and c abov fda shall either accept the recommend reject it or modifi it base upon the agenc independ evalu with analysi and reason for reject or modif of recommend health claim in arriv at it decis fda may consid data or inform other than that befor the committe there shall be a presumpt to be sustain when the record is view as a whole in favor of a committe recommend under either b or c emphasi ad despit assert to the contrari the last sentenc of paragraph d oblig fda to establish that the committe was wrong in order not to follow the committe recommend ultim therefor there would in fact be a signific transfer of author if the suggest provis were to be adopt by fda as fda note in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33704 there is no basi under the act for such a transfer of author fda doe not question that expert on an industri committe or panel on herb and botan could be help the agenc encourag firm to work through such group for this reason fda revis the provis pertain to petit in the health claim final rule to clarifi that the agenc will consid all recommend by such committe and panel see 101 70 b fda recogn that those petit that have undergon an independ scientif review and receiv endors by qualifi expert group will like be well support petit and could be veri persuas to fda further fda is like to place consider weight on the recommend of outsid expert and it decis as to whether a petit should be grant could be influenc signific by these expert although fda encourag firm to work through group of outsid expert the agenc would be concern if such group were heavili weight with medic practition as one of the comment suggest over relianc on such practition to the exclus of scientist repres other relev scientif descript impli that the herb are to be use for medicin purpos fda stress again that health claim are about the relationship of food rather than drug to a diseas or health relat condit 2 establish of an approach base on a more lenient or the same standard fda propos to subject dietari supplement to the same scientif standard and procedur that the statut provid for food in convent food form section 403 r 3 b i of the act the standard codifi in 101 14 c state c valid requir fda will promulg regul author a health claim onli when it determin base on the total of public avail scientif evid includ evid from well design studi conduct in a manner which is consist with general recogn scientif procedur and principl that there is signific scientif agreement among expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu such claim that the claim is support by such evid fda explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that it know of no standard and procedur for dietari supplement that would both be more lenient than the standard and procedur for food in convent food form and yet still have the characterist that fda consid necessari under the 1990 amend and their legisl histori the agenc state that it had tentat conclud that a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act 21 usc 343 a 1 or that allow health claim base on the exist of substanti scientif evid even though signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim doe not exist would be inconsist with congresss desir to ensur that health claim that are made on food includ dietari supplement are scientif valid fda said that it was concern that if it were to allow claim in the marketplac whose valid had not been establish these claim would undercut the credibl of those health claim that are in fact valid the agenc said that if it were to allow such claim consum would be left littl better off and no less confus than they were in 1989 befor the passag of the 1990 amend fda also express it tentat view that the propos approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other 58 fr 33700 at 33706 4 a larg number of comment assert that fda should establish an approach base on a more lenient standard for dietari supplement some of these comment argu that such an approach is direct by congress and cite a statement of senat hatch one of the primari author of the 1990 amend that a more lenient standard for dietari supplement s is envis one comment argu that by provid for the establish of a separ standard for dietari supplement congress had implicit reject the rigid standard of signific scientif agreement adopt for food in convent food form the comment assert that fda was therefor bound by basic tenet of statutori construct to adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement as such an action would give mean to congresss instruct wherea the adopt of the propos standard would in effect render those instruct meaningless the comment note that court have tradit not interpret provis of a statut in way that would render other provis superflu a number of comment state that use the same standard and procedur for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form is counter to the intent of the 1990 amend becaus congress intend to make more rather than less inform about the health benefit of dietari supplement avail to consum the comment assert that health inform about the effect of diet on diseas is particular import to consum of dietari supplement in decid which product to buy sever comment argu that restrict this inform on dietari supplement will deni million of american the inform that they need to improv their health and to help reduc their risk of dead afflict such as heart diseas and cancer the comment assert that such restrict will cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been save through diseas prevent some comment express concern that restrict the use of proper qualifi health claim base on preliminari evid would encourag inform hungri consum to seek inform about the health benefit of various dietari supplement from sourc such as book and the media which may be unreli and which are not regul by fda these comment argu that adopt a polici that result in consum turn to inform that may well be mislead or outright fals is contrari to the educ goal of the 1990 amend one comment stress that fda should assist consum by encourag them to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet lifestyl and other factor comment suggest that fda should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin all possibl for consum misunderstand or all element of risk associ with increas consumpt of dietari supplement a few of these comment advis that a more lenient standard would be appropri for dietari supplement becaus they are be sold to educ consum rather than to the general popul some of these comment disput the argument that consum could be misl by a more lenient standard these comment note that consum continu to reli on health messag on product such as cigarett and condom despit the fact that the messag have chang over the year in respons to new scientif find other comment state that studi have indic that consum are abl to use various advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner sever comment assert that fda should allow the use of preliminari health claim on dietari supplement and food in convent food form becaus it allow their use on drug the comment state that fdas propos revis of the pediatr use subsect of prescript drug label in the feder regist of octob 16 1992 57 fr 47423 would allow prescript drug that had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children to nevertheless be given to children provid that the drug efficaci claim were qualifi by the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish the comment state that becaus these drug had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children their claim would be preliminari at best and misbrand at worst howev mani comment argu against a more lenient standard and procedur for dietari supplement sever comment stress that the adopt of the propos standard and procedur is support by the legisl histori of the 1990 amend and the ds act one of these comment maintain that while the 1990 amend give fda the option of adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the congression record denot a major opinion in favor of fda appli the same standard to supplement that the act provid for convent food a number of comment also warn fda that hold dietari supplement and food in convent food form to differ standard for health claim would lead to consum confus as the health benefit of nutrient deriv from dietari supplement would be allow to be character as superior to the benefit of those same nutrient deriv from food in convent food form some comment assert that the creation of public confus would direct undermin the intent of the 1990 amend to clear up consum confus about health claim inform and would jeopard consum confid in exist health claim food label and the govern particular public health offici anoth comment assert that adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement could also allow some supplement manufactur to make unsubstanti claim and undercut consum belief in the credibl of the entir supplement industri these comment assert that a singl univers standard would best prevent consum confus by ensur that health claim inform is uniform on all food sever comment support the same standard and procedur on the ground that it would ensur that health claim appear on the label of dietari supplement are base on reliabl peer review reproduc evid a number of these comment state that becaus supplement unlik convent food are taken specif for the health benefit associ with them it is especi import that health claim on these product be reliabl becaus more and more consum are use these product in the belief that the product will protect their health the comment said that these consum were respond to the larg amount of recent evid indic that vitamin miner and other nutrient may play a role in reduc the risk of chronic diseas some comment caution fda that the failur to ensur that health claim on dietari supplement are reliabl would leav consum open to fraud a few of these comment point out that mani consum do not have the scientif knowledg to judg the verac of label claim for themselv and presum that fda regul ensur that label claim are proper substanti one of these comment warn that older american are especi vulner to fraud this comment point out that the elder suffer disproport from diet relat diseas read supplement label more often than other peopl are more trust of salesperson and do less research than younger consum other comment warn that unsubstanti health claim can harm consum by induc them to consum product that are inher unsaf to consum excess dose of some substanc or to forego more benefici form of treatment for a given maladi a number of comment insist that the propos regul will not restrict the flow of inform on nutrit and health to consum one of these comment state that rough 80 percent of supplement label are alreadi in complianc with the propos regul other comment note that educ materi are not cover by the propos regul and that there are mani avail channel through which inform can be freeli dissemin other than food label moreov one comment contend that supplement label are neither intend nor current use to educ the public but instead serv to sell the product to which they are attach some comment state that appli the same standard to both convent food and dietari supplement would creat a desir level play field for all food processor and manufactur one comment state the adopt of the propos standard will provid an atmospher in which all food manufactur can move toward the product of healthier food which will benefit the public health in fdas reconsider of how best to regul dietari supplement one of the most signific issu has been the issu of whether supplement should be regul under a more lenient standard or the same scientif standard as that establish by congress for food in convent food form despit assert by some that congress direct that a more lenient standard be establish the legisl histori of the 1990 amend doe not support such a posit to the contrari as other comment point out and as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim propos 56 fr 60537 at 60539 through 60540 the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2507 through 2509 and the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 congress did not intend that the agenc be forc to adopt a differ standard for dietari supplement instead congress gave the agenc the discret to adopt ani appropri scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement there was noth in the comment that indic that fda doe not have this discret inde as some of the comment point out there was consider support in both the hous of repres and the senat for adopt of the same scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement fda address the posit of member of congress on this issu in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33703 senat hatch left no question about his posit that fda should use this flexibl to adopt the standard and procedur for dietari supplement that appear appropri to the agenc to adopt a more lenient standard howev other member of congress were equal clear about their posit that fda should not adopt a more lenient standard in the octob 24 1990 congression record at s 16608 ref 4 senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state it is my view that there is no reason to do anyth other than util the same procedur and standard for dietari supplement whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud further the hous of repres clear did not support a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the statement of hous floor manag that appear in the octob 26 1990 congression record at h 12953 ref 2 state whatev approach the agenc take it must adopt a system that evalu the valid of ani diseas claim made with respect to these substanc it system must be base on consider of public health and consum fraud as in everi similar decis made by the agenc today we fulli expect that the agenc evalu of diseas claim made with respect to vitamin will be base on sound scientif principl there is a great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim the potenti is just as great for vitamin as it is for other product in our view vitamin and other substanc cover by this provis should be subject to at least as strong a standard as is applic to other food that contain claim that the food will treat a diseas or health condit noth in the ds act or it legisl histori indic in ani way that congress chang it posit about it goal of the 1990 amend with respect to prohibit mislead health claim and improv of the public health through use of valid and understand claim in food label ref 3 although congress left no question that the exact standard and procedur for the regul of health claim for dietari supplement is left to the discret of fda and although congress did not provid direct guidanc concern how fda should use this discret congress did provid consider general guidanc about the intent of the health claim provis of the 1990 amend in view of the fact that this guidanc doe not distinguish between dietari supplement and food in convent food form fda consid this guidanc to be applic to both type of food as point out abov in this respons senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state that whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement he stress that the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 4 the quot statement of the hous floor manag also stress that the agenc approach to regul dietari supplement must be base on consider of public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 2 in addit these quot statement make it clear that congress consid the use of inaccur or unsupport health claim on food label to be harm to the public ref 2 moreov mr waxman one of the hous floor manag state the follow in the juli 30 1990 congression record h5844 what we have sought to do is to permit health claim but onli health claim base on scientif valid inform and we hope by have that scientif valid inform upon which a claim can be made that health claim in the futur will be health and not mislead furthermor as the agenc point out in the januari 6 1993 feder regist 58 fr 2478 at 2526 by enact the 1990 amend congress sought to ensur that health claim would be scientif valid and not mislead see for exampl statement of rep madigan and statement of rep waxman ref 2 experi had shown that mani unfound health claim were be use on food statement of rep waxman ref 2 congress recogn the great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim id statement of hous floor manag in respons to the high potenti for health claim to be mislead congress legisl that ani claim that is not consist with fda regul will misbrand a food section 403 r 1 b of the act state that a food is misbrand if it label or label contain a claim that expressli or by implic character the relationship of ani nutrient of the food to a diseas or a health relat condit unless the claim compli with regul promulg by fda 403 r 1 b emphasi ad by take this approach congress chose to permit onli those health claim on food that fda determin to be scientif valid effect recogn that health claim are so potenti mislead as to be inher mislead appli the same standard and procedur to health claim on dietari supplement as that that appli to food in convent food form will not affect the avail of ani dietari supplement will ensur that health claim that appear in label are scientif valid and understand and will subject all segment of the food industri to regul in a fair and consist manner those comment favor the same standard and procedur for reason of fair control of consum fraud and convey of valid inform about diet and it impact on a diseas or health relat condit serv to reinforc fdas conclus that the agenc propos rule should be final as propos the agenc disagre with argument that use of the same approach for dietari supplement as for convent food would deni million of american the dietari inform that they need to improv their health and therebi cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been avoid as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 in the absenc of adequ data to establish that health claim are valid assert about cost associ with the lack of inform in food label and about the benefit of consumpt of substanc in dietari supplement are high specul and high question fda doe not agre that it should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin the possibl of consum misunderstand fda must weigh the public health impact of permit a multitud of preliminari claim against the possibl that a signific portion of those claim will be determin to be not scientif valid the latter result would like produc a percept among mani consum that food label and health claim even those that are valid are not reliabl to the extent that as a result consum do not chang their dietari pattern to reduc their risk of diseas they will be less healthi and there will be more needless death from diseas and more cost to the nation economi rather than less when fda made this statement the phrase adequ data to establish that health claim are valid was intend to express the posit that until the valid requir of 101 14 c are met cost assert about the benefit of substanc consumpt are high specul and high question in general prior to fulfil of this requir there may often be studi with a wide varieti of strength and weak indic that there may or may not be a valid associ between a substanc and a diseas or health relat condit in decid whether or not to author a claim fda must consid that while benefit may accru from the avail of the claim there is a veri real possibl that signific cost may accru if the claim is author prematur a few studi may often be found about a multitud of associ and mani if not most of those associ will ultim be found not to be valid if fda were to permit preliminari claim about such a multitud of associ the agenc believ that ultim what would be lost is the confid of most consum in the valid of all claim that appear in food label fda believ that the cost to consum of such a situat would prove to be greater than the cost of not permit preliminari claim of greater signific howev is that needless death would ultim occur where consum would not chang their dietari pattern to adopt a more health diet the agenc believ that congress in it enact of the scientif standard in section 403 r 3 b i of the act struck what it believ to be an appropri balanc between the cost and benefit of claim on food in general fda is not awar of ani reason to strike a differ balanc for dietari supplement fda would like to assur all affect parti that the agenc will move as expediti as possibl to permit health claim onc the scientif evid is suffici support to conclud that associ between substanc and diseas or health relat condit are valid although some comment assert that claim base on a more lenient standard would not be confus becaus consum of dietari supplement are more knowledg than the general popul fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that there is noth that limit the purchas of dietari supplement to knowledg consum the comment did not submit justif for fda to chang it posit in this regard assert that use of the same scientif standard for dietari supplement as that establish for food in convent food form is counter to the 1990 amend becaus less inform about diet and diseas will be avail to consum are not correct under the 1990 amend author health claim provid consider more inform about the effect of diet on diseas where the effect are recogn as scientif valid than was the case befor the passag of the 1990 amend in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 fda author claim with respect to 7 relationship see 58 fr 2537 2552 2622 2665 2739 2787 and 2820 also in the feder regist of octob 14 1993 58 fr 53254 fda propos to permit health claim concern the relationship between folat and the risk of neural tube birth defect admit other health claim are not permit to appear on food label and label but congress clear intend through enact of section 403 r of the act that onli valid health claim be permit with respect to concern that consum will be forc to seek inform about diet and health from unregul sourc such as book and the media if fda doe not author preliminari claim fda advis that it must implement the provis of the amend as congress chose to enact them the 1990 amend focus onli on food label and label fda cannot ignor it clear respons under the 1990 amend becaus of concern about the unregul sourc of inform that were mention in the comment moreov while such sourc of inform may lead consum to seek out product contain particular substanc fdas action will ensur that the label and label of those product contain onli scientif valid inform that can dispel ani misconcept creat by the unregul sourc with respect to other concern express by these comment the agenc believ that the specif requir element in the health claim that it has author to date demonstr that the agenc is encourag consum to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet and lifestyl for exampl the specif requir in 101 72 c 2 a requir in part that a claim about calcium and osteoporosi make clear that an adequ level of exercis and a health diet are need in addit to adequ calcium consumpt argument that the agenc should allow preliminari claim becaus of fdas implement of the drug provis of the act have no merit assert about fdas propos action pertain to pediatr use for drug label in 57 fr 47423 are clear wrong the agenc propos action with respect to requir the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish pertain onli to drug for which there is no agenc approv for ani pediatr popul to use the drug in point of fact the agenc propos to requir this statement as a further warn that the product should not be use for pediatr popul thus this action provid no support for author preliminari health claim as fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33706 make dietari supplement subject to the same scientif standard and procedur as for convent food doe not render section 403 r 5 d of the act superflu this section requir that the agenc consid what procedur and standard respect the valid of claim are most appropri this is what the agenc has done the fact that the agenc has found that on balanc the standard and procedur establish for food in convent food form are also the most appropri for dietari supplement doe not render the agenc effort invalid or the under provis superflu the agenc was charg with exercis it expertis and discret and that is what it has done 5 a number of comment provid specif suggest about the way in which a more lenient approach could be implement some comment argu that the approach should be suffici lenient to permit market of dietari supplement without ani restrict some of these comment argu that dietari supplement need no stringent requir becaus dietari supplement could be adequ regul under the requir in section 403 a 1 of the act that the label of a food must be truth and not mislead other comment suggest that fda could requir a warn inform the consum that fda had not substanti particular claim appear on a product one comment suggest that substanti claim could be allow to appear within a specif advisori panel of the label while preliminari claim would be allow to appear onli outsid the panel anoth comment suggest that fda adopt a split label approach in which preliminari health claim would be allow but the agenc would have the right to comment upon them on the label one comment suggest that health claim for which there is substanti scientif evid but not yet signific scientif agreement be subject to a certif and notif procedur rather than rulemak proceed under the procedur suggest by the comment claim could be made for dietari supplement so long as 1 the claim expressli disclos the absenc of scientif agreement as to the relationship 2 the manufactur provid fda with a fulli document certif by a panel of at least three qualifi expert that there is substanti scientif evid support the claim and 3 fda doe not disapprov the claim within 90 day of receipt of the certif when addit inform is need the 90 day period could be extend an addit 45 day under this suggest altern fda would have an opportun to particip in the select of the expert panel one comment request that fda onli disallow the use of those health claim on dietari supplement that are not support by ani evid and that it classifi all other health claim into one of five categori and allow for their use on product in conjunct with a code system indic to consum the level of substanti that the claim has achiev the comment suggest that the highest categori be full substanti the second those claim that have a high degre of substanti as judg by non fda expert but that fda find to be not fulli substanti the third claim that have support in the form of doubl blind placebo control studi publish in peer review profession journal the fourth claim that are support by some evid from in vitro studi anim studi or other studi that do not involv human and the fifth those claim support by anecdot evid in support of it call for various approv level the comment state that simpli categor a claim as substanti or unsubstanti doe not accommod the realiti that full substanti of a health claim consist of cumul evid from mani studi the comment maintain that if fda were to place all claim that have not achiev full substanti into the same categori fda would not be provid a mean for the public to distinguish claim that are near substanti from those that are entir fals moreov the comment state that an agenc determin that a claim is or is not support by signific scientif agreement often reflect a polit decis rather than a scientif one the comment said that fda panel compris a veri small percentag of the scientif communiti that other scientist often disagre with the panel find and that there even may be differ opinion within the panel themselv the comment state that given these condit it is blatant dishonest and mislead to the public for fda to make a general declar that a claim is or is not substanti a few similar comment call for fda to devis a multilevel approv scheme for health claim on dietari supplement that would allow statement concern the tradit use of a product to appear on the label and would permit the label of a supplement that contain a substanc that was the subject of a pend health claim petit to indic that the product was under fda review for a health claim but not to indic the natur of the claim the comment state that the adopt of this approach would encourag manufactur of product that qualifi onli for the tradit use or claim pend approv categori to gather perform and submit research inform to fda in order to reach higher approv level one comment suggest that fda allow manufactur to use facsimil of the fda seal in conjunct with the various rate the comment assert that this approach would encourag manufactur to come into complianc with fda regul quick as the seal would becom valuabl market tool for which consum look when purchas supplement and the lack of a seal would becom a market disadvantag for a compani fda has consid these altern standard and procedur suggest by the comment and find that none of them have the characterist that are necessari to achiev the goal envis by congress in pass the 1990 amend previous in this preambl the agenc conclud that congress intend that fda adopt a scientif standard and a procedur that ensur that health claim that appear in label are scientif valid and understand none of the altern standard and procedur offer by the comment meet this object one of congress primari concern in pass the 1990 amend was the widespread use of health claim whose scientif valid had not been establish ref 1 the purpos of the 1990 amend was to bring that situat under control the problem with the altern procedur offer by the comment is that rather than bring the use of claim on dietari supplement under control they would ratifi the state of affair that caus congress to act as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act or that allow health claim base on the tradit use of the supplement or the exist of substanti scientif evid but not signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim would be inconsist with congresss desir to ensur that health claim that are made on dietari supplement or on ani other food are scientif valid fda point out that if such claim were to be permit consum would be face with a multitud of claim some valid and some not valid fda state that it would be unlik that consum could distinguish between valid and invalid claim although comment on the dietari supplement health claim propos assert that consum would not be confus by a multitud of claim the comment did not actual go further in address how consum would react to such a situat in food label more specif the comment did not provid data to resolv the question of whether consum would be abl to understand gradat of scientif reliabl of claim on food label or whether consum would in fact be left as confus as they were befor passag of the 1990 amend while a number of comment did assert that some studi show that consum are abl to use various advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner the studi were not actual submit in the absenc of the studi fda has no basi upon which it can evalu the assert of the relev of the studi to food label in the absenc of evid to the contrari the agenc consid it more like that consum would be consider confus by a multitud of claim with differ degre of reliabl one of the purpos of the 1990 amend was to end such confus see statement of mr waxman 136 congression record h12953 ref 2 therefor fda reject this assert approach such as those involv a split label or the use of an fda seal would also not be consist with the congression desir for scientif valid becaus manufactur would still be abl to market dietari supplement with claim that were not scientif valid even if fda seal were be use to distinguish those claim that fda consid to be valid there would be a question as to whether consum would be abl to ascertain which claim were preliminari and which were not these approach would not restrict the number of health claim that were of question valid about which congress was specif concern ref 1 thus fda has conclud that it would not be appropri to adopt ani of the altern approach suggest by the comment 6 sever comment suggest that fda adopt the reason substanti standard use by the feder trade commiss ftc see ftc polici statement regard advertis substanti program 49 fr 30999 august 2 1984 the comment assert that under this polici fda could allow manufactur to make claim provid that the natur of the scientif find is accur repres the degre of evid is not misrepres and the claim pass a rough cost benefit test the comment argu that this polici would facilit harmon with the ftc regul govern the use of health claim in food advertis would allow consum to have access to truth nonmislead and reliabl label inform and would still allow fda to take action against those dietari supplement bear health claim that are not proper substanti argument that fda should adopt for dietari supplement ftcs approach for regul advertis are not consist with congress expect for health claim while the ftc and fda are work togeth to achiev as much consist in their approach to health claim as their respect statut allow adopt by fda of the ftc advertis substanti approach would not provid fda the confid congress intend concern the scientif valid of the claim specif as explain abov one of congress main purpos in pass the 1990 amend was to ensur that health claim made in food label are scientif valid no such assur of scientif valid is provid under the standard that ftc must employ under that standard there must be some evid to support a claim but it need not rise to the level of establish the claim valid thus the ftc standard is not adequ for health claim in this context it is appropri to reiter fdas respons to comment assert that it was bound to follow case involv ftcs regul of advertis in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2528 although case involv ftc may sometim be relev it is import to note that fundament differ exist between the regulatori scheme administ by the two agenc congress has long recogn the divis of role between the two agenc ftc concentr on the interest of commerc and econom need wherea the object of fda is the health of the peopl ftc regul unfair competit and trade practic includ food advertis see for exampl 15 usc section 45 and 52 in contrast fda is a scientif agenc empow to regul the food label among other thing under section 403 r 3 b i of the act fda may permit health claim on food onli if it has determin that those claim meet the statutori test for scientif valid the law under which ftc oper do not includ a compar statutori standard thus it would not be appropri for fda to follow the case law involv ftc iii the final regul in light of the forego fda is subject dietari supplement to the same standard and procedur that appli to food in convent food form the agenc believ that this approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the one hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other thus the agenc is revis 101 14 and 101 70 to includ dietari supplement a definit in the health claim propos fda propos definit for health claim substanc nutrit valu and dietari supplement to serv as tool for clear establish the scope of the type of claim that would be subject to the regul promulg under section 403 r 1 b of the act in addit the agenc propos a definit for disqualifi nutrient level to establish limit on the level at which certain nutrient that are known to increas the risk of a diseas or health relat condit could be present in a food and the food would still be elig to bear a health claim see section 403 r 3 a ii of the act in the health claim final rule the agenc adopt definit for the term health claim substanc nutrit valu and disqualifi nutrient level that it revis in respons either to comment or to the ds act see 101 14 a 1 2 3 and 5 also fda adopt a definit for the term diseas or health relat condit although the term is use in the definit of health claim and the term serv to identifi one of the basic element of a health claim the agenc had not propos a definit for it the agenc ad this definit to clarifi the coverag of the health claim provis see 101 14 a 6 becaus of the ds act the agenc reserv the question as to whether these definit would appli to dietari supplement the agenc also did not includ a definit of dietari supplement in the final rule becaus of the moratorium impos by the ds act in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda propos to adopt the same regulatori scheme for health claim for dietari supplement that it had establish for food in convent food form to effect this tentat decis the agenc propos to revis the definit of substanc to make clear that it cover both food in convent food form and dietari supplement and to establish a definit for dietari supplement fda receiv no comment on the former aspect of the propos therefor the agenc is adopt it as propos howev fda did receiv some comment on it propos definit of dietari supplement 1 dietari supplement fda propos the follow definit for the term dietari supplement propos 101 14 a 4 dietari supplement mean a food not in convent food form that suppli a compon to supplement the diet by increas the total dietari intak of that compon in the past fda has taken a posit that the term dietari supplement appli onli to supplement compos of essenti nutrient howev fda did not propos to limit the definit in 101 14 a in this way becaus section 403 r 5 d of the act includ dietari supplement of herb substanc that general contain few essenti nutrient in addit the legisl histori indic that the term other nutrit substanc could includ a number of substanc that have not been shown to be essenti or nutrient ref 4 7 one comment commend the agenc for propos a definit of dietari supplement that recogn that these food could have compon other than substanc known to be essenti nutrient the comment assert that the propos definit would appropri move supplement out of the food addit categori fda advis that the comment assert that the definit move dietari supplement out of the food addit categori is not correct a dietari supplement as the definit recogn is a compound food that may includ compound that are food addit whether a compon of food is a food addit or not is determin under section 201 s of the act 21 usc 321 s not section 403 r of the act congress specif provid in section 9 of the 1990 amend that these amend shall not be constru to alter the author of the secretari of health and human servic under the feder food drug and cosmet act thus the compon of dietari supplement that are food addit are still fulli subject to the food addit requir under section 409 of the act 8 a few comment request that the propos definit of dietari supplement be modifi to explicit includ all herbal extract one of these comment assert that the definit should includ process or unprocess plant part bark leav flower fruit and stem as well as extract of essenti oil market as tea powder tablet capsul and elixir fda is adopt the definit of dietari supplement as propos this definit is intent broad to cover the rang of substanc that under the legisl histori could be includ in a dietari supplement and could be the subject of a health claim the purpos of the definit of dietari supplement is not to defin the substanc that may be elig to be the subject of a health claim but to defin the form in which they are to be sold to be subject to regul as a dietari supplement under the scheme that fda is adopt and that congress envis see ref 4 statement of senat metzenbaum the determin as to what substanc are appropri the subject of a health claim is made on a case by case basi base on the factor set out in 101 14 b and the evid present to the agenc the agenc disagre with the comment in one respect howev tea are food in convent food form and thus not includ within the definit of dietari supplement 9 one comment assert the definit of dietari supplement should includ food in convent food form that are fortifi with a vitamin or miner to a level of 50 percent or more of the refer daili intak rdi per serv eg mani breakfast cereal fda doe not agre that such food should be includ in the definit of dietari supplement as discuss in the preambl to the dietari supplement propos 58 fr 33700 at 33707 fda has limit this definit to food not in convent food form to reflect the approach taken by congress in the ds act the manag statement for the ds act from the senat and the hous ref 3 clear state that the moratorium on the implement of the 1990 amend appli onli to dietari supplement not in the form of convent food becaus food in convent food form were not cover by the ds act moratorium the health claim regul alreadi appli to them consequ fda believ that it will reduc confus about the impact of these regul if the agenc limit coverag of the term dietari supplement to food not in convent food form of cours food in convent food form that are formul to supplement the dietari intak of nutrient will be free to reflect their characterist in their common or usual name eg vitamin and miner supplement cereal 2 nutrit valu in the health claim final rule fda defin nutrit valu as follow nutrit valu mean a valu in sustain human exist by such process as promot growth replac loss of essenti nutrient or provid energi although fda did not propos ani chang in the definit of nutrit valu in the dietari supplement health claim propos mani comment express concern about the impact of this definit in conjunct with the preliminari requir in 101 14 b 3 i that the substanc that is the subject of a health claim contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 o and that the substanc must retain that attribut when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim preliminari requir are criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim an indepth discuss of all preliminari requir follow in section iii b of this document 10 some comment urg the agenc to broaden it definit of nutrit valu these comment urg the agenc to recogn that the process by which a nutrient promot health maintain proper bodili function and protect the bodi from the develop of chronic diseas or other health relat condit are in and of themselv characterist of nutrit valu the comment note that the basic function of vitamin e for exampl relat to it antioxid properti in prevent cell damag by trap peroxyl free radic and inhibit the oxid of unsatur fatti acid also the comment point out that fiber doe not promot growth replac essenti nutrient or provid energi but that congress specif requir fda to studi the relationship between various diseas and fiber some of the comment ask that the phrase prevent or repair the negat metabol consequ of life process be ad to the list of process that character the nutrit valu of a food to ensur that such compon can be the subject of health claim a few comment assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit howev one comment maintain that the definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement the comment support it posit by agre with fdas statement in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 that the inclus of the phrase such as in the definit ensur that the three referenc process are exampl of how a substanc may confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list the comment that highlight fdas use of the phrase such process as in this definit is correct fda intend the three referenc process to be exampl of how a substanc may confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list of the function that provid such valu as fda explain in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 the definit of nutrit valu is intend to be veri flexibl the agenc incorpor this flexibl in the definit becaus fda recogn that certain substanc can play a major role in reduc the risk of certain chronic diseas and may confer their benefit through a number of process fda believ that the agenc should evalu the nutrit valu claim for a substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim as describ in a health claim petit on a case by case basi this approach will best ensur that the definit retain it intend flexibl and doe not becom an unintent barrier to author for legitim health claim fda doe believ howev that this preambl should provid guidanc concern how the agenc will determin if a claim nutrient diseas relationship deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc in general the agenc will look for evid that the claim effect on diseas is associ with the normal mainten of human exist if the substanc is use to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit the action of the substanc is clear beyond a normal mainten function and the health benefit would therefor not deriv from the substanc nutrit valu such a substanc would be a drug note also that claim about classic nutrient defici diseas are not health claim see 58 fr 2478 at 2481 fda recogn that mani of the benefit mention in the comment may deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc the agenc broad definit of nutrit valu includ assist in the effici function of classic nutrit process and of other metabol process necessari for the normal mainten of human exist dietari fiber for exampl help to assur normal intestin transit time therebi provid nutrit valu by promot effici bowel function vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag with respect to assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit the agenc point out that the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2501 through 2502 fulli address this matter and conclud that a claim that a substanc can be use in the prevent diagnosi cure mitig or treatment of a diseas or symptom is inappropri for a food see section 201 g 1 b of the act and 101 9 k 1 21 usc 101 9 k 1 fda reach this conclus becaus the relationship of a food or a food compon to a diseas is quit differ from that of a drug the comment make these assert did not provid ani basi upon which fda could conclud that the agenc posit in this matter should be differ for dietari supplement than for food in convent food form as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule the surgeon general report on nutrit and health ref 5 point out that apart from classic disord result from dietari defici of essenti nutrient eg pellagra and niacin it has prove difficult to demonstr causal associ between specif dietari factor and chronic or other diseas eg dietari fiber and cancer the report state develop of the major chronic diseas condit coronari heart diseas stroke diabet or cancer is affect by multipl genet environment and behavior factor among which diet is onli one albeit an import compon these other factor interact with diet in way that are not complet understood in addit food themselv are complex they may contain some factor that promot diseas as well as other that are protect the relationship of dietari fat intak to causat of atherosclerot heart diseas is a promin exampl an excess intak of total fat if character by high satur fat is associ with high blood cholesterol level and therefor an increas risk for coronari heart diseas in mani popul a higher proport of mono and polyunsatur fat in relat to satur fat is associ with lower blood cholesterol level and therefor with a reduc risk for coronari heart diseas becaus of these complex definit scientif proof that specif dietari factor are respons for specif chronic diseas condit is difficult and may not be possibl to obtain given avail technolog ref 5 11 sever comment argu that the definit of nutrit valu should includ level of nutrient that are achiev onli through the use of fortifi food or dietari supplement sever of these comment referenc studi recent report in the new england journal of medicin that indic that vitamin e reduc the risk of heart diseas when consum at level that are almost imposs to achiev through a convent diet but that can be easili and safe attain through the use of dietari supplement these comment assert that it would be inappropri for fda to categor the involv nutrient level of vitamin e as therapeut and to refus to consid approv a health claim simpli becaus the claim concern level of a nutrient abov that achiev in a normal daili diet a few of the comment support this assert by note that the mechan by which vitamin e protect against cell damag when consum at normal dietari level is ident to the mechan by which it protect against heart diseas when consum at higher level the comment maintain that in case such as this one the agenc should approv health claim for use strict on dietari supplement provid that the nutrient is safe when consum at the level at which the claim effect is achiev and the supplement is intend to be consum to optim health rather than as a drug the comment support this regulatori approach by note that the health benefit of calcium occur when the nutrient is consum at increas level that can be achiev through the diet or by supplement and state that vitamin e should not be treat differ simpli becaus the benefici level cannot be reach without the use of dietari supplement similar comment argu that fda should at least avoid establish a maximum level of a nutrient that is consid to be characterist of nutrit valu one of these comment note such an approach result in an extrem fuzzi line becaus the maximum level of a nutrient that is achiev in a diet vari wide from one individu to anoth as an exampl the comment point out that a person who eat ten orang or drink a quart of orang juic per day get more vitamin c than is provid by most current market vitamin c supplement a few comment assert that there is much scientif disagr over what level of a nutrient are nutrit with mani scientist contend that level much higher than the us recommend daili allow us rda fall within the definit a few comment request that fda explicit express in it regul a polici that nutrit valu may involv relat high level of a nutrient a few comment maintain that fda should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it has proof to the contrari in support of this posit a number of comment object to the use of niacin effect on blood cholesterol level in the dietari supplement propos as an exampl of an effect that is not nutrit one of these comment question fdas assert that niacin doe not exhibit cholesterol reduc properti when ingest at the level convent associ with it function as a vitamin the comment state that niacin vitamin effect occur below the level of tissu satur and maintain that the excret of niacin when consum at higher level known to be associ with cholesterol lower effect doe not necessarili indic that tissu satur has occur this comment also disagre with the agenc statement that the occurr of liver damag when high level of niacin are consum indic that the effect of niacin at these level is not nutrit in natur the comment argu that it is quit possibl that niacin continu to have nutrit effect at these level but simpli is overload the bodi normal metabol pathway for rid itself of excess level of the nutrient the comment assert that while legitim safeti concern exist in particular case of excess nutrient intak fda should not use this fact to conclud that high level of those nutrient are inher nonnutrit in natur and are instead pharmacolog other comment express the belief that noth in the propos regul would automat exclud high level of nutrient from the definit of nutrit valu and urg the agenc to includ such level in instanc where they would benefit the public health these comment also agre with fdas decis to review on a case by case basi whether the amount of a substanc is appropri as the subject of a health claim one of these comment state that such an approach would help to ensur that health inform about fortifi food and dietari supplement can be convey without trigger the drug regul fda doe not believ that it is necessari for the rule to explicit state that nutrit valu includ relat high level of a nutrient as some comment point out the case by case approach which as state abov is intrins link with the preliminari requir in the provis of 101 14 b 3 i provid the agenc with consider flexibl with respect to high level of substanc in dietari supplement under this approach fda has not as a general rule establish ani maximum level at which a nutrient would ceas to have nutrit valu furthermor the agenc advis that there is no basi for concern that fda would use safeti concern alon to conclud that high level of nutrient are pharmacolog fda will not do so as some of the comment point out petit for claim that requir that high level of substanc be ingest should have no problem demonstr that the substanc has nutrit valu where the mechan by which the substanc affect the risk of diseas at these high level is the same as the mechan by which it function as a nutrient at normal dietari level howev it will still be necessari as the agenc explain in respons to the previous comment for the petit to show that the substanc effect on diseas is associ with the normal function of the human bodi eg the substanc could not be use to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit in it respons to the previous comment the agenc acknowledg that vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag if there are situat where it can be establish that this same antioxid mechan affect the risk of diseas when the vitamin is consum at level signific higher than normal dietari level such level would satisfi the requir in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc retain it food attribut ie it nutrit valu when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim fda doe not agre howev that it should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it has proof to the contrari it would not be practic for the agenc to bear the burden of determin the mechan by which the claim effect is occur for each petit claim thus the agenc find that it is appropri to requir that petition provid the basi for whi it is reason to conclud that the claim effect is nutrit and not pharmacolog howev the agenc doe not necessarili expect absolut proof on this issu fda will evalu petit on this issu on a case by case basi the agenc has consid assert that the dietari supplement propos should not have cite the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin as an exampl of a high dose effect that is not nutrit fda has again conclud that niacin is an appropri exampl becaus there are signific indic that a nutrit mechan is not respons for the cholesterol lower effect that occur with high level of niacin intak when fda state in the dietari supplement propos that level of niacin necessari to produc the cholesterol lower effect are far in excess of the level at which there is tissu satur for niacin vitamin function the agenc was attempt to explain that for niacin function as a vitamin there is a level beyond which addit niacin will not provid addit function result for that vitamin the term tissu satur may impli either this type of situat sometim refer to as function satur or the type of situat refer to in one of the comment wherein the tissu is satur with a concentr of a substanc and more substanc could immedi spill out into the urin fda was not attempt to assert that the tissu itself was actual satur there is no question that addit niacin will be absorb by cell when the vitamin function satur level is reach in addit to the situat with vitamin function satur there are other indic that the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin do not result from the same mechan as that present by it vitamin function vitamin function satur may be achiev through dietari supplement with either of the two form of the vitamin nicotin acid or nicotinamid howev onli nicotin acid provid at high level the cholesterol reduc effect such effect do not appear with high level consumpt of nicotinamid ref 6 if the same mechan were involv with the vitamin function of niacin as with the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin both form of this vitamin should have cholesterol reduc properti 3 health claim in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda did not propos to make ani modif in the definit of health claim in 101 14 a 1 health claim mean ani claim made on the label or in label of a food includ a dietari supplement that expressli or by implic includ third parti refer written statement eg a brand name includ a term such as heart symbol eg a heart symbol or vignett character the relationship of ani substanc to a diseas or health relat condit impli health claim includ those statement symbol vignett or other form of communic that suggest within the context in which they are present that a relationship exist between the presenc or level of ani substanc in the food and a diseas or health relat condit nonetheless fda receiv sever comment on this definit 12 some comment assert that fda should clarifi the type of statement that will be regul as health claim a few of these comment ask whether statement that indic that a product may be use in maintain good health eg substanc x may be benefici to good health or that describ the biochem function of vitamin miner and other nutrient eg vitamin a is necessari for good eyesight protein help build a strong bodi will be consid to be health claim the comment object to fdas failur to provid clear instruct in this regard these comment assert that the agenc allow of case by case interpret of the regul will hinder industri complianc creat enforc problem for the agenc and caus continu antagon between fda and the food industri fda believ that it provid ampl guidanc on what type of statement constitut health claim in the health claim final rule as the agenc explain in the preambl of that rule 58 fr 2478 at 2479 through 2488 the definit establish that a claim must have at least two basic element for it to be regul as a health claim first the claim must be about a substanc as defin in 101 14 a 2 second the claim must character the relationship of that substanc to a diseas or health relat condit as defin in 101 14 a 6 diseas or health relat condit mean damag to an organ part structur or system of the bodi such that it doe not function proper eg cardiovascular diseas or a state of health lead to such dysfunct eg hypertens except that diseas result from essenti nutrient defici eg scurvi pellagra are not includ in this definit claim pertain to such diseas are therebi not subject to 101 14 or 101 70 if a statement has one of these element without the other it would not be a health claim although it may still be subject to regul under other provis of the act eg the requir of section 403 a 1 of the act that a label statement be truth and not mislead thus all of the statement mention by the comment would not be health claim becaus they do not address a diseas or health relat condit as defin under 101 14 a 6 the agenc has provid a lengthi and detail discuss on what type of statement constitut health claim in the health claim final rule at the page cite abov 12 a few comment ask whether fda would remov or prohibit the publish of book contain inform on health claim and argu that such regul would clear be unconstitut other comment address the issu of whether fdas health claim regul for dietari supplement would appli to advertis one of these comment interpret an excerpt from the report of fdas task forc on dietari supplement as an attempt to disallow the use of unapprov health claim in magazin newslett or other media channel unless the inform has been preapprov by fda that excerpt read the task forc consid various issu in it deliber includ how to assur the safeti of dietari supplement how to limit the potenti for fraud ie diseas claim made on label or through other mean eg magazin articl newslett and advertis the comment further assert that this same intent is reflect in the health claim regul propos in novemb 1991 the comment state that this broad base applic of the health claim regul would sever jeopard the report of health and diseas relat inform in almost everi form of media would inhibit the evolut of scientif knowledg would have a signific negat impact on the public health of america and was like unconstitut fda advis that the provis of this regul pertain onli to a product label and label this regul doe noth to censor the content of book magazin or advertis this regul also doe not in ani way regul the avail of book magazin or advertis howev firm sometim choos to use such materi as label for their product and if use as such the materi would be subject to this regul for exampl sometim firm copi an articl from a magazin and display that articl with a product that is offer for sale under such circumst the articl would be a part of the label of that product what is signific to note is that these regul in no way limit what articl may be publish or what book may be print they limit onli the claim that may be made in the label of food product under the act advertis may provid object evid of what the intend use of a particular product is if the advertis reveal that the product is intend to be use as a drug the product may be regul as a drug in addit claim made in advertis may affect the type of nutrit label that is provid see 101 9 j claim made in advertis howev are not subject to section 403 r 1 b of the act thus the agenc find no merit in the concern express by these comment b preliminari requir for a claim in the health claim final rule fda establish sever criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim the criteria provid that the substanc must 1 be associ with a diseas or health relat condit for which the general us popul is at risk altern the relev of the claim may be explain within the context of the daili diet see 101 14 b 1 2 be a food see 101 14 b 2 and b 3 i and 3 be safe and law under applic food safeti provis of the act see 101 14 b 3 ii these criteria reflect not onli the requir of section 403 r of the act but also the fact that fda is charg with ensur that the food suppli is safe and that the food label is not mislead given that agenc evalu of the valid of a health claim will be resourc intens fda decid not to undertak such evalu unless a petit for a health claim demonstr that the preliminari requir are met while fda had propos in novemb of 1991 that these preliminari requir cover substanc in dietari supplement as well as food in convent food form the provis of the ds act preclud the agenc from appli these preliminari requir to substanc in dietari supplement at the time that the rule was final thus the preliminari requir establish in the health claim final rule appli onli to substanc in food in convent food form the dietari supplement health claim propos contain provis to subject the compon of dietari supplement to the same preliminari requir in 101 14 b that appli to ani other substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim this final rule for dietari supplement retain these provis as propos specif refer to dietari supplement in 101 14 b 1 and b 2 is not necessari becaus the requir in these paragraph appli general to ani substanc and fdas revis of the definit of substanc in 101 14 a 2 includ the compon of dietari supplement within the coverag of this term howev fda propos to add a specif refer to dietari supplement to paragraph b 3 i of 101 14 to clarifi that the substanc may be a compon of a food that is in the form of a dietari supplement the onli comment on the issu agre with the agenc propos revis accord as propos fda is includ in the final regul a refer to dietari supplement in the codifi languag of 101 14 b 3 i specif fda is insert the phrase regardless of whether the food is in convent food form or dietari supplement form into 101 14 b 3 i 1 effect on general popul 13 one comment argu that the propos requir that a substanc be associ with a diseas or health relat condit for which the general us popul or a subpopul thereof is at risk or that the claim be explain within the context of the daili diet would prohibit the appear of health claim on herbal dietari supplement howev the comment did not explain how the requir would have this effect and the comment own analysi of how garlic would or would not meet various propos requir indic that garlic would meet this particular requir fda doe not agre that this preliminari requir will present ani signific barrier to the appear of health claim on dietari supplement to the contrari as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2499 fda intend to employ a flexibl approach in interpret this provis the altern aspect of the provis which creat the possibl of claim about the relationship of a substanc to a diseas or health relat condit that affect veri few in the us popul as long as the petit in support of the claim address that fact and the relev of the claim in the context of the total daili diet evid a determin by fda to provid the widest latitud possibl for propos claim to qualifi under this provis 14 one comment request that fda not limit the diseas or health relat condit that may be the subject of a health claim to those for which the entir unit state is at potenti risk the comment assert that health claim should also be allow in case where dietari factor have been conclus shown to affect diseas or health relat condit for which onli a particular subport of the us popul is at risk eg ovarian cancer in women fda advis that the general elig provis of it health claim regul in 101 14 b 1 do not contain the restrict cite by the comment while these provis contain a requir that health claim pertain to diseas or health relat condit affect the general us popul they also provid that health claim may pertain to diseas or health relat condit for which an identifi subgroup of the us popul is at risk thus ovarian cancer in women would clear be an appropri subject of a health claim 2 compon of food within the context of a daili diet the preliminari requir that a substanc that is to be the subject of a health claim must be a food appear in 101 14 b 2 and b 3 i if the substanc is present at decreas dietari level under 101 14 b 2 it must be a nutrient that is requir to be includ in nutrit label eg cholesterol total fat if the substanc is present at other than decreas dietari level under 101 14 b 3 i it 1 must contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani other technic effect list in 170 3 o to the food and 2 must retain that attribut when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim 15 numer comment express concern about the aspect of the preliminari requir of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in view of the agenc definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 a number of these comment character these provis as an attack by the agenc against dietari supplement some comment assert that the propos preliminari requir would prohibit dietari supplement especi those contain herb from bear health claim comment point out that mani herb such as garlic are special process to remov the flavor or odor from the final supplement product a number of comment explain that such supplement would fail to meet this requir becaus their benefici effect on the bodi often are deriv from substanc uniqu to the plant that do not promot growth replac loss of essenti nutrient or provid energi a few comment also note that mani herb contain insignific amount of vitamin miner and other nutrient some comment assert that the adopt of ani preliminari requir that would automat disqualifi herbal dietari supplement from bear health claim would undermin the intent of congress to establish a nondrug review process for health claim involv herb these comment assert that the 1990 amend clear provid that herbal dietari supplement can be the topic of a health claim furthermor a comment assert that the court of appeal held in nutrilab inc v schweiker 713 2d 335 338 7th cir 1983 that some product such as prune juic or coffe may be consum for reason other than tast aroma or nutrit valu one comment assert that all dietari supplement alreadi meet the this preliminari requir the comment note that a substanc to be consum at other than decreas dietari level may also be shown to be a food by contribut ani technic effect list in 170 3 o the comment state that 170 3 o 20 list one of those technic effect as nutrient supplement and broad defin a nutrient supplement as substanc which are necessari for the bodi nutrit and metabol process fda doe not believ that it is over restrict to requir as it doe in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc be a food or a compon of food for it to be the subject of a health claim section 403 of the act which includ the health claim provis state a food shall be deem to be misbrand emphasi ad thus section 403 r of the act describ the circumst in which a food will and will not be misbrand if it bear a health claim it is therefor appropri for the agenc to make it incumb on the propon of a health claim to demonstr that the substanc that is to be the subject of the claim is a food or compon of food fda disagre with the comment interpret of the nutrilab decis as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2499 2500 the nutrilab court adopt a common sens definit of food under section 201 f 1 of the act when the statut defin food as articl use for food it mean that the statutori definit of food includ articl use by peopl in the ordinari way most peopl use food primarili for tast aroma or nutrit valu nutrilab 713 2d at 338 other court have follow suit see unit state v undetermin quantiti of cal ban 3000 776 f supp 249 254 55 ednc 1991 american health product co v hay 574 f supp 1498 1508 09 sdni 1983 affd 744 2d 912 2d cir 1984 by describ tast aroma and nutrit valu as the primari reason for consum food the nutrilab court acknowledg that a food consum for one of these reason might sometim also be consum for an addit purpos 713 2d at 338 give prune juic and coffe as exampl of food that may be consum on occas for reason other than tast aroma or nutrit valu under nutrilab howev a substanc whose use do not includ tast aroma or nutrit valu is not a food in 101 14 b 3 i fda incorpor this common sens definit of food and the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o which reflect the fact that the definit of food in section 201 f 3 of the act includ articl use for compon of food as a preliminari requir to ensur that a substanc that is to be the subject of a health claim is in fact a food this preliminari requir is fundament becaus both the compon of a food that is the subject of a health claim and a compon of a drug have a characteriz relationship to a diseas congress recogn this fact by creat an except from section 201 g 1 b of the act in the definit of drug for food that bear a claim author under section 403 r of the act thus it is crucial to the continu viabil of the act itself that the choic of the test that determin whether a claim that character the relationship of a substanc to a diseas can be made be base on the appropri factor under the act that choic turn in part on whether the substanc is a food therefor fda has reflect in 101 14 b 3 i the judici recogn characterist of a food in this regard interest person should not presum that inclus of the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in 101 14 b 3 i mean that substanc that may be classifi within one or more of the categori of food addit in 170 3 o automat meet this preliminari requir the classif within 170 3 o are of a general natur to reflect the use to which food ingredi are put all of the classif pertain to the effect of the ingredi on food eg by affect the textur of the food rather than on the human bodi onli a substanc that is use for the technic effect in 170 3 o 20 that of a nutrient supplement has the potenti to have a use effect in the bodi becaus of the characterist that caus it to be use in the food the nutrient supplement categori includ substanc which are necessari for the bodi nutrit and metabol process as the comment themselv recogn not everi compon of a dietari supplement has such an effect in view of the agenc broad flexibl definit of nutrit valu fda doe not find ani merit in argument that the provis requir that a substanc be a food should be remov to the contrari fda believ that these provis will benefit the public health by allow the agenc to devot it limit resourc for review of petit to those that are appropri for consider under the health claim provis of the act accord fda consid these provis essenti element under the framework that it has creat in it regul for the regul of health claim and fulli consist with the act fda disagre with the comment character of it action as an attack against dietari supplement fda believ that the combin effect of 101 14 b 3 i the preliminari requir that a substanc be a food and 101 14 a 3 the definit of nutrit valu will not present dietari supplement with ani unreason barrier for agenc evalu of potenti health claim for compon of these product without question these provis do restrict health claim to effect on a diseas or a health relat condit result from the nutrit valu of substanc howev as one comment point out the current definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement one observ that might bear make in this context is that congress has given the agenc a statutori structur with which to deal in relev part that structur divid the world of substanc that have a relationship to diseas into food and drug congress place the health claim provis on the food side of the ledger fda is charg with implement those provis in accord with the act and applic legal preced fda has announc it intent to implement the health claim provis as flexibl as possibl but at some point the agenc simpli cannot be as flexibl as some of the comment have suggest at that point the agenc would start to erod the scheme that the statut has establish for drug the agenc cannot do that if congress intend someth that goe beyond the scheme that fda has establish in these final regul then what is requir is a chang in the law itself 16 mani comment object to the aspect of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc retain it food status ie it nutrit valu when consum at level that are necessari to justifi a claim almost all concern was direct toward consumpt of substanc at level signific higher than those present in the daili diet some comment urg fda to evalu propos health claim involv relat high level of nutrient on the ground that categor prohibit them would deni american benefici inform rather than educ them on how to alter their diet to achiev optim health other comment state that fdas categor refus to evalu such health claim becaus of the nutrient level involv would direct violat both the proxmir amend and the congression intent behind the 1990 amend these comment note that the 1990 amend provid for the appear of health claim on food and state that subject to certain condit the proxmir amend prohibit against regul a vitamin supplement as a drug sole becaus it exceed the level of potenc which the secretari determin is nutrit ration or use guarante the regul of vitamin as food regardless of the level of nutrient that they suppli the comment also state that congress envis the approv of such health claim as it was awar that dietari supplement substanti in excess of the us rdas were routin be consum by american and it chose to direct that fda conduct a review of antioxid vitamin cancer claim with dietari supplement in mind other comment further assert that fda was attempt to circumv the proxmir amend and creat maximum potenc level for all supplement by establish an upper limit for nutrit valu fda doe not agre that ani conflict with section 411 of the act is present by a requir that to be the subject of a health claim the substanc must be a food that is consum primarili for it tast aroma or nutrit valu there is noth in the health claim final rule or in the regul establish by this document that will affect in ani way the avail of dietari supplement or consum freedom to choos to purchas them rather the regul that fda is establish are intend to ensur that ani health claim that may be made for dietari supplement are scientif valid this is what section 403 r 5 d of the act direct fda to do noth in these regul would necessarili prevent a supplement from bear a health claim when it contain a level of a substanc that exceed the level achiev in the context of the daili diet to the contrari the final rule concern calcium and osteoporosi for exampl which was publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2665 permit a calcium health claim for dietari supplement and requir onli that the supplement label advis consum in appropri circumst that there is no known benefit from consum more than 200 percent of the recommend daili intak for calcium section 411 of the act doe not author health claim for dietari supplement or in ani way affect fdas author under section 403 r 5 d of the act to regul such claim under section 411 a 1 b of the act fda may not classifi a dietari supplement as a drug sole becaus it contain a vitamin or miner at a level that exceed the level of potenc that the agenc determin is nutrit ration or use noth in these propos regul would do so absent a claim fda will not consid a dietari supplement to be a drug becaus it contain vitamin or miner at level abov those normal found in food howev a claim on a product is an indic of the product intend use if a claim reveal that the product is intend for a use other than for it tast aroma or nutrit valu then noth in section 411 of the act would requir that it be treat as a food 17 mani comment address the circumst under which dietari supplement should be consid drug a number of these comment refer to the follow agenc statement in the health claim final rule comment 49 58 fr 2478 at 2501 a product that is intend for medicin effect that is intend for use in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas is a drug and not a food thus there is no basi under the act for fda to permit health claim for herb whose onli known use is for medicin effect health benefit of such herb may appear in the label onli in accord with the drug provis of the act although a few comment agre with this statement mani comment express categor opposit to the classif of ani herb or other dietari supplement as drug while most of these comment did not offer reason in support of their posit one comment express concern that such a polici would be ground for fda to categor ban all such supplement as unapprov new drug sever comment note that mani herb have tradit been use both as food and drug and ask for assur that fda would not automat regul such herb as drug other comment argu that herb should alway be regul as food where they are consum for their nutrit valu some comment stress that intend use as state on it label should be the determin factor in decid whether a supplement should be regul as a food or as a drug as an exampl one of these comment state that a supplement market for a specif therapeut use eg a vitamin c tablet sold to cure cancer is appropri regard as a drug while a supplement sold to be taken over a period of time to reduc the risk of develop a diseas eg a vitamin c tablet sold to be taken daili to reduc the risk of cancer should be regul as a food the comment assert that this approach is consist with fdas determin that a supplement contain larg amount of niacin should be regul as a drug when consum to lower serum cholesterol anoth of these comment emphas that a consum use of a legal label product should not have ani weight in determin whether that product is a drug as an exampl the comment note that fda doe not regul either fiber or water as a drug as long as their label doe not bear drug claim even though consum may use them to facilit bowel movement or to prevent mitig or treat dehydr respect a few comment suggest that fda determin whether a substanc is a food or a drug by it chemic composit the comment assert that while the boundari between drug and supplement is fuzzi at time drug are typic synthet molecul that are of a uniqu and patent natur while dietari supplement consist of natur nonpatent materi anoth comment state that fda should exempt substanc taken to treat a symptom of a diseas from regul as drug as the act defin as drug onli those substanc use in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of the diseas itself earlier in this preambl fda explain that these regul do not affect the avail of dietari supplement again these regul affect onli the food label and food label fda has no intent of ban all dietari supplement of herb or similar substanc as unapprov new drug fda will carri out it respons to regul inappropri claim but the agenc will not attempt to restrict the sale of dietari supplement to consum unless the supplement present safeti concern with respect to the specif word for use in label statement fda advis that statement that a product may be effect in the cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas will make the product a drug howev statement that a product may reduc the risk of develop a diseas or health relat condit may or may not make the product a drug exact how a substanc diseas relationship is to be character is one of the issu that the agenc will address in decid whether to author a health claim and how to ensur that the claim describ the signific of the substanc in affect the diseas or health relat condit fda point out that as a general matter mere use term such as reduc the risk instead of prevent will not automat make a claim a health claim and not a drug claim fda will make a case by case assess base on all relev factor in determin whether a claim is appropri subject to the health claim regim the agenc also agre that the main focus in decid whether a product is subject to regul as a food or a drug is the intent of the vendor and not how consum use the product although how consum understand claim that are made can be use to determin vendor intent fda advis that there is no provis in the act for the agenc to exempt statement about symptom of diseas from caus product to be regul as drug although such statement may not be claim that the product will treat the diseas that caus the symptom the statement clear pertain to the mitig of diseas by address the symptom caus by the diseas section 201 g 1 b of the act provid in part that articl intend for use in the mitig of diseas are drug similar there is no provis in the act for fda to exempt natur nonpatent materi from the definit of a drug in section 201 g of the act fda advis that it not true that all natur materi are not drug it has been estim that about 25 percent of the drug current prescrib by physician are plant compound and that an addit 25 percent are relat to plant therefor fulli half of the drug common use can be consid plant deriv such common use drug as digitali aspirin quinidin atropin and hundr of other were onc consid herbal thus the agenc find that it cannot reli on the distinct of whether a product is natur or synthet in decid whether it is a food or a drug 3 safeti section 101 14 b 3 ii provid that to justifi a claim for a substanc that is to be consum at other than decreas level the substanc must be a food or a food ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi whose use at the level necessari to justifi a claim has been demonstr by the propon of the claim to fdas satisfact to be safe and law under the applic food safeti provis of the act the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33709 explain this show can be base on 1 a demonstr that the substanc is general recogn as safe gras within the mean of 170 30 2 a list of the substanc as gras in 21 cfr part 182 or as affirm as gras in 21 cfr part 184 3 a food addit regul or 4 a sanction or approv grant by fda or the unit state depart of agricultur prior to septemb 6 1958 if the safeti and law of the substanc is not expressli recogn in an fda regul the burden will rest on the claim propon as a prerequisit to fdas evalu of the health claim to submit all the scientif data and other relev inform requir to demonstr safeti and law in accord with applic petit requir fda will withhold review of the health claim until it is satisfi on these point 18 mani comment object that the propos safeti provis are unreason a few of these comment specif assert that herbal supplement would almost univers fail the propos safeti requir becaus most herb are not gras for use as a dietari supplement are not approv food addit and are not the subject of prior sanction or are the subject of prior sanction that have been waiv furthermor the comment complain that fdas process for act on gras affirm petit is notori slow and extrem cost the comment maintain that the propos safeti requir would discourag manufactur from submit health claim petit for dietari supplement would delay the approv of such petit and could well amount to a total ban on health claim for certain dietari supplement the comment suggest that fda requir safeti determin onli for those substanc with no histori of safe use and provid that the absenc of known safeti problem will be suffici proof of safeti for substanc with a long histori of use other comment urg fda to be flexibl in it determin of safeti for substanc in dietari supplement a number of these comment stress the import of fda recogn that safeti can be determin sole through the histor use of such substanc some of the comment note that mani compon of supplement particular herb have been use for hundr or thousand of year without safeti problem the comment also note that herb are use safe throughout three fourth of the world as a princip mean of medicin the comment declar that regulatori author in great britain germani japan and mani other nation have research various herbal supplement and found them to be safe when consum at the level of use like to be contempl under a health claim petit one comment also note that inform concern accur dosag indic contraind and qualiti control measur are also avail in past edit of the us pharmacopeia and nation formulari these comment urg fda to accept all relev data on the safe use of herbal dietari supplement includ foreign studi and monograph that evid the safeti of these product one comment declar that fda is legal bound to consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state when review the safeti of herb one comment assert that fda should evalu the safeti of vitamin and miner in term of their effect on the normal popul and not on those consum with unusu condit or sensit the comment acknowledg that such consum need clear label ingredi statement as well as educ on food to deal with their problem the comment assert howev that these consum should be held respons for some degre of self protect the comment maintain that this approach is consist with the agenc polici on person with allergi to food compon a few comment assert that the safeti of a dietari supplement should be defin in term of whether or not harm may occur under the condit of use defin by the supplement label rather than in term of an arbitrari cutoff such as the rdi the comment maintain that a systemat review of all compon of dietari supplement is not necessari and suggest that the agenc undertak safeti review on a case by case basi where it believ a potenti safeti concern might exist sever comment assert that fda is not equit in it concern for the safeti of dietari supplement as compar to the safeti of other product regul by the agenc some comment assert that the safeti record of dietari supplement is far better than mani fda approv food addit such as aspartam against which accord to the comment the agenc receiv and ignor thousand of consum complaint annual other comment assert that fdas intens interest in the safeti of product would be better focus on prescript drug which are respons for over 1 2 million death annual as compar to the no or few death attribut to the consumpt of dietari supplement howev sever comment support fdas propos to requir that petition for a health claim for a substanc in a dietari supplement demonstr that the substanc is safe and law the comment agre with the agenc that such a requir is implicit in the act and that the label law in no way diminish fdas respons to ensur the safeti of food fda conclud that the preliminari requir that the safeti of a substanc be demonstr should appli to substanc in dietari supplement in the same manner that it appli to substanc in food in convent food form the amend to the act enact by the 1990 amend cannot be implement independ of the remain portion of the act see section 9 of the 1990 amend the act must be consid as a whole and fdas respons for ensur the safeti of food is explicit provid for in other section of the act see section 201 s 402 a 1 and 2 and 409 of the act as the agenc explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos the fact that the act contain such explicit safeti author is particular signific becaus the agenc will be specif author the health claim that will be made in view of this affirm action fda author of a health claim place the agenc imprimatur on the claim moreov the claim will encourag consumpt of the substanc it would be a violat of the agenc respons under the act to author a health claim about a substanc whether it be in a dietari supplement or in food in convent food form without be satisfi that the use of the substanc is safe certain fda would have almost no assur that it would be protect the public health if it permit as some comment suggest all substanc except those that are actual known to caus safeti problem to be the subject of health claim it would be a great and tragic ironi if substanc that were the subject of health claim becaus of one effect caus injuri becaus of anoth this is the situat that congress sought to avert by includ section 403 r 3 a ii in the act fdas preliminari requir is fulli consist with the principl that underli that section the fact that some herb and other ingredi of dietari supplement have been use for thousand of year doe not necessarili justifi a conclus by fda that their use under all condit is safe but it may first fda need a basi for conclud that such use was in fact without harm effect second fda need a basi for conclud that consumpt of ingredi in a supplement carri a health claim would be in amount compar to those consum safe in the past the propon of claim for such substanc are certain free to demonstr that the use of those substanc is general recogn as safe base on their common use in food prior to 1958 the agenc note howev that the use of mani of these substanc has been primarili as a drug tonic or folk remedi rather than as food see 53 fr 16544 at 16545 may 10 1988 this fact is confirm by some of the comment summar abov as drug the level and frequenc of use of these substanc may have been signific differ than the level and frequenc of use that will result from their use as food although the agenc will consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state fda still need to review data on the ident of the substanc the safeti of the substanc the use of the substanc in food the context of it use and the frequenc of use in the countri where use of the substanc occur see 50 fr 27294 at 27295 juli 2 1985 evid that anoth countri has studi the safeti of an herbal supplement and found it to be safe would certain be relev and should be submit to fda it is import howev that as much of the evid that provid the basi for the countri determin as is possibl be submit to fda although formal recognit of safeti by fda admit can be lengthi and expens such formal recognit is not requir under this preliminari requir in respond to concern rais by comment suggest that fda recogn manufactur privat gras determin the agenc state in the health claim final rule the follow concern 101 14 b 3 ii 58 fr 2478 at 2502 through 2503 fda acknowledg that the gras affirm and food addit list process can be lengthi thus fda design 101 14 b 3 ii to provid flexibl with respect to the type of show of safeti that is necessari to make a substanc elig to be the subject of a health claim gras affirm and food addit list are but two of the procedur by which a substanc may meet this preliminari requir fda intend to consid the basi of manufactur independ gras determin where such determin are submit with petit for health claim and may use it discret to accept without formal affirm the independ determin of gras where fda believ that such action would be appropri as fda point out in the previous comment howev the agenc would not be fulfil it respons under the act if it were to permit a substanc to be the subject of a health claim without satisfi itself that the use of that substanc is safe although fda will consid all manufactur independ gras determin where the basi for such determin are submit with petit for health claim the agenc advis that it will general not be possibl for fda to judg whether gras determin base on complex scientif evid are valid within the short timefram mandat under the 1990 amend for health claim petit instead agenc agreement with an independ determin that a substanc is gras will be most like where the substanc is an ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi that was in common use in food prior to januari 1 1958 in a similar context howev where such agreement occur the agreement doe not constitut gras affirm instead the histori of common use in food coupl with the fact that fda know of no reason to question the safeti of the food ingredi mean that the substanc will be treat as if it is an unlist gras substanc as provid for in 170 30 d and 182 1 a 21 cfr 170 30 d and 182 1 a in the manner provid for in the food ingredi list in 21 cfr part 182 58 fr 2478 at 2503 under this final rule this statement is fulli applic to substanc in dietari supplement the agenc believ that this polici on independ determin that a substanc is gras demonstr that fda will be flexibl in assess conform with the safeti preliminari requir fda disagre with assert that the agenc should evalu the safeti of dietari supplement in term of onli the normal popul it would be unconscion for the agenc to adopt a polici of ignor advers effect some of which could be life threaten of ani food includ dietari supplement on vulner segment of the popul furthermor there is no basi under the act for such a polici fda doe attempt howev to find the most practic solut to assur consum of a safe food suppli for exampl the agenc general doe not base safeti decis on atyp popul subgroup that will use the product where there are subgroup of consum eg consum with certain sensit that could suffer advers effect from consum the product fda may place certain restrict on the use of the product or reli on label solut such as those the agenc has use for sulfit agent and yellow 5 as a condit for it safe use rather than deni the avail of the product to the entir popul thus for all the forego reason fda is make health claim for substanc in dietari supplement like claim for ani other food subject to 101 14 b 3 ii c scientif standard 19 mani comment express concern that fda would appli the term signific scientif agreement in an unreason manner by demand too much support evid on substanc diseas relationship befor approv health claim sever comment insist that fda is misinterpret the requir for the scientif standard for food in convent food form as well as for dietari supplement the comment assert that the law doe not requir that there be signific scientif agreement that a nutrient diseas relationship has been conclus establish but onli that the statement made in a claim be support by the avail evid as an exampl one of the comment assert that the requir of the law would be fulli met by a proper qualifi label claim such as although no scientif consensus has been establish sever clinic studi suggest that daili consumpt of vitamin c as part of a well balanc diet may reduc the frequenc of cold a number of comment assert that the standard for author health claim on food are more stringent than those author the use of drug claim sever comment argu that fda is be unduli restrict by requir that manufactur perform expens random doubl blind placebo control test to prove the valid of a claim under the propos regul these comment state that such requir would deter manufactur from seek new use for herb and other substanc use in dietari supplement the comment maintain that a more lenient standard would encourag manufactur to engag in research to develop more health product the comment further assert that the dispar treatment of food and drug is especi unfair when the enorm differ in safeti factor between dietari supplement and untest prescript drug is consid some of the comment assert that fda had not been fair to date in it evalu of health claim under this standard one of these comment assert that fda had approv onli four of the ten congression propos health claim not seven as fda claim in the preambl to the propos regul some comment maintain that fda should not requir a unanim or near unanim consensus among expert in order to find that there is signific scientif agreement concern a claim a few of the comment point out that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend clear indic that such a level of agreement is not to be requir other comment urg that fda consid the requir for signific scientif agreement to be satisfi as long as there is agreement among a major of scientist familiar with the research in a given area these comment note that commission kessler offer testimoni support this interpret befor the us hous of repres subcommitte on health and the environ other comment maintain that the requir for signific scientif agreement onli requir agreement among a signific number of qualifi expert one of these comment request that fda includ a provis in the regul that the standard of signific scientif agreement is not one of unanim to prevent confus among manufactur and consum a few comment ask that fdas regul includ a provis that guarante that signific scientif agreement will be consid to have been achiev when a credibl health author particular an agenc of the us govern recommend the consumpt of a nutrient becaus of it relationship to a diseas or health relat condit one comment suggest that fda not use the phrase signific scientif agreement to evalu propos health claim despit it inclus in the languag of the 1990 amend becaus the mean of the phrase is ambigu the comment suggest that fda should simpli consid the total of public avail scientif evid to determin whether or not a particular health claim can be justifi fda disagre with assert that it is conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda doe not requir that manufactur perform control clinic trial to prove the valid of a claim to the contrari as discuss in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2506 the scientif standard for health claim is less stringent than the requir for approv of a new drug in the case of a new drug section 505 d 5 of the act 21 usc 355 d 5 state that the secretari shall refus to approv an applic for approv of such a drug where there is a lack of substanti evid that the drug will have the effect that it purport or is repres to have under the condit of use prescrib recommend or suggest in the propos label thereof section 505 d provid further that the term substanti evid mean evid consist of adequ and well control investig includ clinic investig human studi conduct in a control clinic set by expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu the effect of the drug involv the statutori term substanti evid should not be confus with the same term use by some comment to refer to more than a scintilla and less than a preponder of evid base on this statutori direct the agenc has identifi a number of characterist that are present in adequ and well control studi in 314 126 21 cfr 314 126 section 101 14 c of fda regul doe not mandat requir as stringent as those for drug in section 505 d 5 of the act section 101 14 c contain no mention of substanti evid adequ and well control investig or of clinic investig to the contrari 101 14 c contain more flexibl than the drug provis of the act becaus it provid fda with author to author claim base on scientif evid includ evid from well design studi conduct in a manner which is consist with general recogn scientif procedur and principl that there is signific agreement among expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu such claim that the claim is support by such evid section 403 r 3 b i of the act consist with this flexibl fda did not prescrib a specif set type or number of studi as be suffici to support a health claim in the health claim final rule that appli to food in convent food form in that rule the agenc advis 58 fr 2478 at 2506 that it would consid all relev data on a topic includ clinic studi epidemiolog data and anim studi in addit the 1990 amend direct fda to consid 10 nutrient diseas relationship in the januari 6 1993 final rule fda author claim with respect to seven of those 10 relationship see 58 fr 2537 2552 2622 2665 2739 2787 and 2820 in addit fda has recent propos to author claim concern an eighth folic acid and neural tube defect see 58 fr 53254 octob 14 1993 fda believ that these approv demonstr that it is not conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda agre that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend make clear that congress did not intend in call for signific scientif agreement about the support for a claim to requir that such agreement repres a full consensus among scientist the hous report ref 1 state the standard doe not requir that there be a unanim agreement among expert instead there must be a signific agreement among expert but it doe not requir that everi expert in the field approv or agre with the claim the agenc share the comment concern that a requir of consensus would mean that some valid health claim would not be author and by restrict such claim would counter congress intent that health claim support by a signific scientif agreement be made avail to consum the agenc never intend to requir that claim be support by a consensus among scientist and has not done so the agenc is sensit to the comment percept that the scientif standard particular the phrase signific scientif agreement is subject the agenc believ howev that ani standard involv the evalu of scientif evid and opinion deriv from that evid must be somewhat subject fda in propos not to defin signific agreement among expert in the novemb 27 1991 56 fr 60537 at 60548 propos note that each situat may differ with the natur of the claim substanc diseas relationship the agenc believ that in decid whether signific scientif agreement about the valid of a claim exist it is necessari to consid both the extent of agreement and the natur of the disagr on a case by case basi the hous report ref 1 make clear that congress intend the signific scientif agreement standard to be a flexibl one by point out that in review scientif studi fda may give greater weight to the studi that it find more persuas the hous report also clarifi that the overrid consider in assess whether to author a claim should be the secretari level of comfort about the valid of the claim the agenc believ that this clarif provid clear guidanc for the applic of the standard and thus it is not incorpor the chang request by the comment in the codifi languag of the regul fda doe not believ it has in ani way been unfair in it approv of health claim to date earlier in this preambl in respons to comment 2 fda explain whi certain specif health claim were not approv nevertheless the agenc statement in the dietari supplement health claim propos that it had author claim on 7 of the 10 nutrient diseas relationship is correct in the case of 3 of the relationship howev the claim were author for food rather than specif nutrient in these case as explain previous although there was suffici evid to attribut certain diseas risk reduct to the consumpt of certain food and those food are mark by signific level of the nutrient in question there was insuffici evid to attribut ani diseas risk reduct direct to consumpt of the nutrient themselv fda doe not agre that it should defin signific scientif agreement as agreement among a major of scientist familiar with the issu commission kessler statement about signific scientif agreement be 50 or 60 percent agreement were intend to show the contrast between this term and the term consensus not to provid a specif definit of signific scientif agreement there is simpli no bright line that fda can draw in this area ultim the agenc must exercis it scientif judgment arriv at after input from the scientif communiti the agenc doe not agre that signific scientif agreement should be consid to have been achiev when a credibl health author particular an agenc of the us govern recommend the consumpt of a nutrient becaus of it relationship to a diseas or health relat condit while fda recogn the signific of such recommend congress charg fda with the respons of author health claim on the food label and label nonetheless the agenc is mind of the admonit in section 403 r 4 c of the act that read if a petit for a regul under subparagraph 3 b reli on a report from an authorit scientif bodi of the unit state the secretari shall consid such report and shall justifi ani decis reject the conclus of such report accord fda is retain the requir for signific scientif agreement in this regul 20 mani comment applaud the agenc determin not to underr ani scientif evid on the basi of it cultur or

appli to food in convent food form fda specif exempt dietari supplement from this requir such supplement are intend onli to provid nutrit valu to the daili diet and they make no pretens of serv as

otc drug product that provid high level of a particular nutrient eg calcium osteoporosi claim on calcium carbon antacid tablet fda receiv a comment similar to this one on the health claim propos this comment provid no basi for the agenc to provid a differ respons to this comment than it did in the health claim final rule as explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2500 multipl use product that are both food and drug present a difficult set of compet concern for the agenc such product are like to be both an otc drug and a dietari supplement most otc drug product are develop to address some type of acut medic problem that is expect to be of short durat if the problem persist it is import that the person with the problem know that it may be more sever than he or she otherwis thought and that he or she should seek medic attent label on such product therefor includ instruct to use the product for a limit period of time and if the problem persist to seek medic intervent thus the time limit on use of the product are import to the health of the user dietari supplement on the other hand are develop for inclus in a daili diet at level that are consist with dietari use and may often be consum throughout most of a person lifetim label on dietari supplement contain no instruct for seek medic intervent or for limit the durat of consumpt of the supplement rather under the new regul dietari supplement will be abl to bear nutrient content and health claim which focus the consum attent on the advantag that consum the product will have in help the consum to maintain a healthi diet moreov where the supplement bear a health claim the claim will contain inform about how long term ingest of the supplement may promot health where dietari level and therapeut level differ as is general the case and is in fact the case with antacid and calcium supplement an appar conflict is creat when both food and drug label appear on the same product in the case of the drug label consum are given direct for use that involv high consumpt dure a limit time period in the case of the food label consum are given direct for lower consumpt with no time constraint even though label instruct may identifi those direct for food and drug use in separ locat fda is concern that consum will incorrect assum that the therapeut dosag is appropri for dietari use and that the direct for food use will undercut the warn in the drug label to seek medic care if the condit persist where the label is not proper follow signific advers consequ may result the agenc know of no broad approach that it can use to harmon a nutrient content claim or a health claim with drug label a drug that is label with instruct for use that both limit and do not limit consumpt would be misbrand under section 502 a of the act 21 usc 352 a if it fail to contain a materi fact that is how to reconcil these conflict instruct howev fda doe not believ that it would be appropri to preclud such claim under all circumst such claim may be permiss if a firm can demonstr that dual claim can be made in a manner that will neither misbrand the product nor creat a safeti problem the agenc suggest that anyon desir to make a health claim or a nutrient content claim that compli with section 403 r of the act on a product that is both a food and a drug contact the center for drug evalu and research otc complianc branch hfd 312 fda 7500 standish pl rockvill md 20855 to discuss whether it would be possibl to put such a claim on the product and still compli with the drug provis of the act g petit 27 a number of comment urg fda to streamlin it procedur for approv health claim in order that dietari supplement manufactur may includ the most current reliabl inform on their product the comment state that the inclus of such inform is critic import to dietari supplement becaus unlik food in convent food form they are consum onli for the health benefit associ with them the comment specif propos that fda add the follow paragraph to 101 70 j 4 final rule fda will within 120 day of the date of public of the propos rule issu a final rule author or prohibit the request use of the health claim 5 expedit action on certain petit if fda determin dure it initi review of the petit that it accur repres the recommend of ani agenc or depart of the us govern with public health respons or of ani other public health organ that is recogn as a credibl sourc of inform on diet and health fda will publish a propos rule author the request use of the claim no later than 60 day from the date of receipt of the petit and will issu a final rule no later than 60 day from the date of public of the propos rule the comment maintain that new provis in paragraph j 4 would correct an obvious oversight in the exist regul ie the establish of a firm deadlin for a propos rule but no firm deadlin for a final rule the comment also contend that paragraph j 5 is necessari to address fdas failur to act prompt to approv claim that are base on the recommend of public health author such as it failur to approv a health claim for folic acid in accord with the recommend of phs agenc fda advis that it failur to specifi in 101 70 j a deadlin for the public of a final rule regard the use of a propos health claim was not an oversight section 403 r 4 a i doe not requir that the agenc adher to ani deadlin for the public of a final rule while fda could establish such a timefram by regul it doe not believ that the adopt of such a requir would be prudent the comment period follow the public of propos rule is a critic step in determin whether a propos regul is appropri for adopt in the instanc of health claim regul signific inform concern the valid of the substanc diseas relationship under the propos health claim may be submit by interest parti dure the comment period also the comment period may bring to light a previous unforeseen potenti for the use of a health claim if adopt without modif to be mislead to consum or to creat serious potenti threat to the public health the agenc has no way to guarante that it will be abl to adequ resolv such problem within the suggest timefram in such instanc if face with a specif timefram fda would be forc to either deni an otherwis valid health claim petit or to approv it without erect the regulatori framework that it believ necessari to ensur that the public health is safeguard therefor fda is not adopt the suggest time limit on the issuanc of a final rule howev the agenc advis that it commit to issu final rule on health claim petit as quick as possibl consist with the issu present and the agenc avail resourc with respect to suggest for shorter timefram for certain petit fda advis that the agenc abil to meet timefram is influenc by mani factor such as work prioriti and avail of personnel fda consid the statutori timefram for assess the valid of health claim and for issu a propos regul to be extrem short given the need to evalu the total of avail scientif evid on a substanc and a diseas or a health relat condit given the agenc limit resourc it would not be practic to shorten these timefram further howev fda point out that although action on petit for most claim will requir virtual all of the time provid by the statutori timefram noth would prohibit the agenc from act in less time than the timefram provid if it is possibl to do so thus it is like that a petit for a claim on a well accept substanc diseas relationship would be review more expediti than one for which scientif agreement is not as clear 28 a few comment urg fda to consid the limit label space avail on mani dietari supplement in develop model health claim the comment state that concis model claim will provid guidanc to manufactur on how to convey health claim in succinct statement that compli with all of fdas requir and will thus help ensur that the health claim present to consum are clear and comprehens fda realiz that there is a limit to the amount of inform that can be present on a food label howev the agenc believ that it must ensur that consum understand that factor other than dietari intak of the nutrient may bear on the substanc diseas relationship given the imper of ensur consum understand of a messag that must be present in a veri limit space the agenc is face with the difficult task of determin what inform is necessari in a claim and what inform is not fda believ that it regul in subpart e of 21 cfr part 101 repres an accept balanc between the consum right to understand the full context of the claim and the manufactur concern over claim length by delin the inform that is mandatori and option in a claim fda is reliev manufactur from have to includ inform that is of tangenti import but ensur that those who wish to make a claim do so in a manner that provid a use and understand messag to consum fda advis that it will take a similar approach when provid model health claim in the futur fda also note that manufactur who are not satisfi with the model claim are free to develop their own version of the claim provid that those version includ all of the inform requir by the author regul 29 sever comment rais the issu of product specif health claim by assert that mani manufactur will be dissuad from undertak the scientif studi and other invest necessari to obtain approv of new health claim petit by the fact that approv health claim will be allow for use on all qualifi product howev a number of comment stress that in a health claim the role of the total diet should be emphas rather than the role of a specif food in risk reduct fda advis that section 403 r 1 b of the act pertain to a claim about the relationship between a nutrient and a diseas or health relat condit rather than about particular food product and such a condit while the agenc has use the term substanc in lieu of the word nutrient and has said that a substanc can be a food in do so the agenc was onli tri to cover circumst such as those present by fruit veget and grain product in which it was not possibl to identifi the specif nutrient in a broad class of food that was have the observ effect on the risk of diseas fda was not therebi includ formul product as possibl subject of health claim such product are formul to includ particular substanc becaus of the nutrit effect of those substanc thus a health claim for such a product would appropri be about the substanc in the formul product and not about the product itself in addit section 403 r 3 b iii of the act direct the agenc to requir that health claim enabl the public to understand the inform in the context of the total daili diet as explain abov fda find that to effect congress intent in pass the 1990 amend the same requir should appli to health claim made on dietari supplement fda believ that a claim that refer specif to the effect on a diseas or health relat condit result from the consumpt of a certain brand name of product would unduli emphas the import of that product and not the import of the total daili diet also such claim could impli that other brand of the same food as well as other food contain the substanc that is the subject of the claim might not have the same effect on the diseas or health relat condit and thus would be mislead under section 403 a of the act accord the agenc find that it is not appropri to approv product specif health claim 30 one comment suggest that fda provid regular month or quarter report concern newli approv health claim petit for display in the supplement section of store the comment maintain that such a list distribut by fda would increas consum confid in the claim when they appear on supplement label although fda recogn that there could be benefit to consum from such

this is a magnific and arduous task and concern the futur of our countri and the fate of social this program was formul in accord with the spirit of decis made by the 13th nation confer of the communist parti of china and subsequ meet of the cpc central committe it goal is to clarifi the strategi principl polici and develop foci for the medium and long term develop of natur scienc and technolog in china and to guid the coordin develop of china s t economi and societi from 2000 to 2020 i situat and choic 1 scienc and technolog are the first forc of product and a magnific revolutionari forc that spur econom and social develop under the superior socialist system s t progress and improv in manag level will play decis role in the cours of china modern and construct shift econom construct further onto the track of reli on s t progress and improv the qualiti of labor will guarante the victori achiev of china second strateg object and lay a solid foundat for achiev our third strateg object base on the strateg three step deploy of china econom construct and in accord with the trend and current of intern s t develop make comprehens arrang for the develop of scienc and technolog for the next 10 to 30 year is an import histor task 2 in the past 40 year china s t activ have made world famous achiev china now has 10 9 million natur scienc and technolog personnel includ 05 million who are involv in research and develop we have over 5 000 independ research and develop organ and there are over 7 000 r d organ under the jurisdict of enterpris they have form a relat complet s t system that has made sever world recogn major s t achiev china has reli main on it own forc to solv mani import s t problem in econom construct nation defens and social develop this is particular true of the past 10 plus year of reform and open up when china has readjust it s t develop principl and made breakthrough advanc in reform of the s t system organ attack on key s t problem extend s t achiev spur s t progress in rural area promot develop of high and new tech industri strengthen intern s t cooper and exchang and other area 3 dure the cours of develop s t work for more

research work and mass technic innov and integr lead cadr with s t personnel worker and peasant to joint spur applic of s t achiev and popular of s t knowledg and improv the scientif and cultur qualiti of all nation our main lesson are one the guid ideolog and actual work in econom and social develop have not alway put promot of s t progress in an import strateg posit two econom develop lack mechan and intern motiv forc for reli on s t progress s t develop lack vital in orient toward econom construct and larg number of technic achiev cannot be convert into forc of product which has result in a certain degre of detach of s t from econom and social develop and an inabl to fulli foster the potenti of scienc and technolog third in s t work there is a lack of unifi arrang and a ration divis of labor as well as the univers exist of repeat problem at low level the phenomena of detach from our nation condit blind push forward and catch up and press urgent for achiev have also occur at time four major error have occur in polici toward intellectu that have damag the initi and creativ of s t personnel and affect the healthi growth of our s t staff a social climat of respect knowledg and respect skill personnel has not been form 4 s t work must be orient toward modern toward the world and toward the futur today new s t revolut that is develop in a burgeon manner in the world has caus s t to permeat everi realm of human societi in an unpreced way which has spur an enorm takeoff of the social forc of product and engend profound chang in the configur of the world the degre to which econom and social develop in each countri is depend on s t progress is increas overlap and intersect of basic research appli research and technolog develop has appear schedul for convert technic achiev into commod product have continu shorten and the relationship among s t educ and product are becom closer look toward the world s t develop over the next 10 to 30 year major breakthrough will happen in sever emerg s t field and new product technolog and new understand of natur phenomena will have profound impact on the develop of human societi the develop of high and new technolog will further transform the face of exist industri and becom a major factor in world econom competit the world econom develop and s t progress are now move toward internation and s t competit is increas becom a decis factor in intern econom competit at the same time mankind must strengthen intern cooper to solv global problem like popul the environ resourc disast and so on that it face in common no countri can achiev modern in a close state 5 china s t develop must begin with our nation condit china has a larg popul a weak foundat and underdevelop social forc of product some 80 percent of our popul live in rural area and we will remain in the initi stage of social for a rather long period of histori into the futur china econom and social develop is face restrict by our popul resourc environ and other factor our popul has alreadi surpass 11 billion and even if we strict control it rate of growth it will still grow to 15 billion by the 2020s although china has rather abund total

world nation have the highest amount of energi consum per unit valu of output and social labor product is equival to onli about 5 percent of advanc world level in the final analysi these discrep are discrep in s t level educ level and manag level if we still lack a sens of crisi and urgenc and do not do everyth we can to catch up the discrep will not shrink and they may even expand the object of china socialist modern and construct will be in danger of fall through and we will not have the place in the world that we should have 6 the key to modern our nation economi and signific rais labor product is modern of scienc and technolog we must certain foster to the greatest possibl extent the role of s t as the first forc of product respect knowledg and skill personnel and more conscious

the provis of the polici the issu of whether the agenc should develop a cleanup polici for histor pcb spill and how such a polici might differ from the exist polici for new spill was address in the anprm in respons to this discuss sever comment on the anprm strong support the idea of develop an epa polici on histor pcb spill those comment suggest that such a polici could achiev consider benefit

accord to the cercla pcb guidanc the concentr of concern for pcbs in soil differ depend on the type of exposur that is expect eg residenti or industri the guidanc document point out that site specif condit may warrant departur from the basic framework outlin in the guidanc due to factor such as the potenti for pcbs to migrat to groundwat and to affect environment receptor the guidanc recommend that in most case the preliminari remedi goal or analyt start point for set remedi level for pcbs in soil under cercla are as follow the tsca pcb spill polici at 761 120 recommend pcb spill be clean up to the follow level for current and reason expect futur residenti and other non restrict access area less than 1 ppm on the surfac to a depth of 10 inch and 10 ppm at depth below 10 inch for

for further studi and subsequ remedi at rcra facil in the rcra correct action program a remedi investig may indic that level of contamin from a past releas are unlik to present a threat to health and the environ epa propos that measur level in the environ be compar to action level and that in situat where measur level are below action level epa would not normal requir either further studi ie a correct measur studi or remedi in the propos rcra correct action rule epa propos use maximum contamin level mcls promulg under the safe drink water act as action level for ground water for other media includ soil and for constitu in ground water that do not have establish mcls the follow criteria were propos for establish action level first the concentr for a hazard constitu must be deriv in a manner consist with agenc guidelin for risk assess second the studi use to deriv action level must be scientif valid third the concentr use as action level would be for carcinogen associ with a 1 10 6 upperbound excess cancer risk for class a and b carcinogen pcbs are class b carcinogen and a 1 10 5 risk level for class c carcinogen for system toxic the action level would be a concentr to which human could be expos on a daili basi without appreci risk of advers effect dure a lifetim the exposur scenario use for calcul the action level was direct contact ie ingest assum residenti land use epa propos includ in 264 521 d a separ provis establish criteria for establish action level for soil assum exposur through consumpt of the soil contamin with a hazard constitu howev epa propos to make an except to this approach where epa has alreadi establish standard for remedi of spill pcbs under the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici in the preambl epa explain that the agenc had determin that the standard in the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici should be use as action level and cleanup standard for soil in rcra correct action 55 fr 30819 propos appendix a to part 264 subpart s provid exampl of concentr level that meet the abov criteria for action level for more than 150 hazard constitu howev epa er in set out the concentr level for pcbs in soil in appendix a 55 fr 30867 epa had intend to list 1 ppm the cleanup goal recommend by the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici for residenti land use as the action level for pcbs instead the action level list in appendix a for pcbs in soil was 09 ppm epa is request comment on correct this erron list epa believ that ad the follow clarifi languag to the end of 264 521 d action level for pcbs in soil shall be defin as 1 ppm consist with the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici at part 761 subpart g would correct the error epa believ that it is appropri to adopt the tsca 1 ppm level for pcbs as the action level for use under the rcra correct action program as previous discuss 1 ppm is the cleanup goal recommend by the pcb spill cleanup polici for residenti land use thus the tsca spill cleanup level is approxim one order of magnitud greater than the action level identifi in the subpart s preambl howev the agenc believ that adopt the 1 ppm level for rcra may be appropri for sever reason for one thing the 1 ppm tsca level is base on the same residenti land use scenario and essenti the same exposur assumpt use in deriv the rcra action level it also repres the same general conserv as an action level in that it equat to a 10 5 excess lifetim cancer risk in addit the tsca level was develop base on substanti studi conduct by the agenc that focus specif on the risk pose by pcbs as well as other relev factor relat to cleanup of pcbs final 1 ppm is close to the analyt detect limit for soil wherea the action level of 09 ppm identifi in the subpart s propos may often be below detect limit the agenc recogn that adopt the tsca 1 ppm level as an action level under rcra would depart somewhat from how other soil action level are set it would be a level establish under anoth regulatori program and as such may reflect certain factor that were not otherwis consid in develop the action level concept under rcra on the other hand adopt the tsca level for soil would be veri much analog to use mcls as action level for ground water as discuss in the juli 27 1990 propos see 55 fr 30819 and 30853 it should also be note that adopt the 1 ppm action level for pcbs requir certain explicit revis to the propos subpart s regul specif as discuss abov the propos criteria for soil action level that were specifi in propos 264 521 d would need to be revis to explicit identifi the 1 ppm level for pcbs in addit appendix a to part 264 subpart s would requir an amend to identifi the new pcb action level the agenc solicit comment on today propos for adopt 1 ppm as the action level for pcbs in soil for the purpos of implement correct action at rcra regul facil although the pcb spill cleanup polici identifi other number that are general appropri for certain land use set the agenc believ that these level are inappropri for use as action level becaus they may often requir substanti site specif inform and determin by the agenc about current and futur land use and exposur potenti this is inconsist with the action level concept which requir identifi conserv presumpt level that can be establish without this type of site specif inform howev the agenc believ that mani of the provis of the pcb spill cleanup polici may be appropri in make decis regard cleanup level in the context of rcra correct action in the preambl to the propos subpart s regul epa state that the cleanup level and practic in the pcb spill cleanup polici would general be appropri for use in address pcb releas under rcra correct action the agenc wish to reaffirm it intent to use the 1987 spill polici as guidanc for cleanup of pcbs in the correct action program in essenti the same manner as has been identifi in the superfund guidanc discuss abov it should be note that the superfund guidanc on pcbs focus primarili on the use of the pcb spill cleanup polici in establish preliminari remedi goal or prgs the subpart s propos did not provid an explicit regulatori framework for set prgs dure the correct action process howev the preambl to the propos did acknowledg that establish such preliminari cleanup goal may often be appropri in a rcra context the agenc may address this issu more thorough in subsequ rcra rulemak in ani case epa intend to use the general approach outlin in the superfund pcb guidanc in establish preliminari cleanup goal when appropri as well as final cleanup level for pcb contamin at rcra facil as explain in the cercla guidanc the level specifi in the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici would general be examin in light of site specif inform and that the agenc would preserv the flexibl inher in the subpart s provis for establish cleanup standard to select a cleanup level for pcbs that may depart from the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici when appropri see propos 264 525 d 55 fr 30877 juli 27 1990 the agenc solicit comment on the concept as outlin abov of use the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici as general guidanc for establish cleanup level under rcra correct action author the agenc also solicit comment on specif provis of the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici for which it may be appropri to modifi or supplement for use in establish cleanup level under rcra d today propos remedi strategi for pcb spill under tsca epa is today propos a new strategi under tsca for cleanup of all pcbs in the environ that is close model after the 1987 tsca pcb spill cleanup polici for new pcb spill from electr equip the agenc believ that adopt such a strategi is warrant for sever reason epa experi with pcb cleanup under cercla has shown that the general approach and the specif cleanup goal express in the 1987 polici are general appropri for cleanup of pcbs not direct address under the polici as long as flexibl is provid for factor site specif condit into final cleanup decis in addit cleanup of pcbs not direct address current under the polici must be address under tsca on a case by case basi with oversight of the cleanup action by epa region this can requir consider paperwork and lengthi negoti between regul and respons parti over cleanup goal and procedur at individu site adopt a simpler more uniform yet flexibl strategi for cleanup of pcbs in the environ under tsca would thus serv to reduc administr and other transact cost and acceler the cleanup process epa is not convinc that there is ani compel technic or environment rational for have sever separ and inconsist method for clean up pcb spill base simpli on when the spill occur under tsca the new strategi and administr procedur propos to address the problem of pcbs in the environ through a flexibl tier approach epa is propos that pcbs dispos of place in a land dispos facil spill or otherwis releas into the environ prior to april 18 1978 would be presum to be dispos of in a manner which doe not present a risk of exposur ie the pcbs are presum to be safe dispos of unless epa make a find that there is a risk of exposur see 761 60 propos revis introductori text in the codifi portion of this document epa could then requir that an applic be submit for approv of remedi and proper dispos of those pcb remedi wast under the propos 761 61 c all other pcb remedi wast would be address by one of sever altern propos today in certain scenario pcbs could be remedi to specifi level and treat under the self implement provis propos at 761 61 a this activ would be conduct with a minimum of interact between epa and the parti conduct the remedi but it would requir that the specifi condit be follow without varianc ani pcb remedi wast could be clean up under the risk base provis propos at 761 61 c this new provis would be harmon with the rcra and cercla program ani chang of the level under rcra and cercla would be reflect in a chang under tsca in the target standard while 761 61 c would provid flexibl base on site specif assess of the risk pose it would also be the most resourc intens and time consum to implement all action address pcbs under superfund would use 761 61 c as the relev requir under tsca thus provid the flexibl necessari to implement site specif remedi action epa is also propos to retain the tradit dispos option under propos 761 61 b for inciner altern treatment technolog and chemic wast landfil this section could be use where all pcb remedi wast would be remov from the environ or where remedi level were establish elsewher in these rule section 761 61 b could also be use where a mechan such as a state establish cleanup was recogn by epa through a coordin approv under propos 761 77 where a state had alreadi establish a site character and or remedi plan requir off site dispos in a facil with a tsca dispos approv for pcbs the current tsca pcb spill cleanup polici would still be avail to address recent spill from electr equip the parti respons for a spill which was elig for cleanup under the spill polici would also have the option of use one of the altern avail under propos 761 61 or 761 79 decontamin where applic it should be note that in accord with the anti dilut provis of 761 1 b if the contamin was from an author use then the pcb remedi wast is regul base on the regulatori status of the pcbs at the time of their releas into the environ the follow illustr this point a transform contain pcb dielectr fluid at 1 000 ppm the unit leak it dielectr fluid and all result pcb remedi wast is regul regardless of concentr becaus the origin dielectr fluid was regul at the time of the leak howev if the same pcb transform is first reclassifi to non pcb status ie less than 50 ppm pcb in the dielectr fluid and non pcb dielectr fluid leak none of the result remedi wast is regul under tsca but not necessarili other law or regul becaus the dielectr fluid was unregul at the time of the leak there are two question associ with ani cleanup the first question is to what level must contamin be clean and the second question is what are the dispos requir for the contamin materi in general the current pcb rule address the dispos question by state that pcbs dilut through act such as spill or process for dispos must be dispos of base on the dispos requir for that pcb concentr at the time the pcbs came out of servic or were spill howev except for those scenario address by the tsca pcb spill cleanup polici the current rule requir complet remov of spill or otherwis improp dispos of pcbs most comment to the anprm were veri support of the agenc desir to amend the current rule to allow the manag of remedi wast base on their current pcb concentr and the site specif risk from exposur sever comment ask that epa address the question of cleanup level by establish in this rule nation standard for specif exposur scenario with provis for varianc that would be bind for remedi of wast contain pcbs for all feder program that would be preemptiv of state and local requir these comment suggest that this approach could reduc the transact cost associ with site by site negoti promot voluntari remedi activ and in general speed the cleanup of site epa has limit author under tsca to preempt state or local requir for the cleanup or dispos of pcb remedi wast with regard to establish uniform standard for specif exposur scenario for the remedi of pcbs and other hazard substanc or constitu epa has contempl the follow option a set specif standard b use a uniform decis make process with target standard but allow site specif varianc or c use a uniform decis make process with a general goal and site specif applic epa believ that specif standard are most appropri when deal with common dispos scenario and limit dispos option favor site specif approach to remedi old spill is most appropri when there is littl common at the various site among the problem be address and the avail dispos option except for the limit scenario propos in 761 61 a epa doe not believ that it has suffici experi or inform to establish addit self implement cleanup and dispos option epa is seek comment support by technic inform from those engag in remedi action other feder state or local entiti respons for the implement or oversight of remedi action and the general public on all three approach includ the follow propos sever remedi approach could be propos for ani given site which is contamin with pcbs in this section epa is propos three altern for the cleanup and dispos of pcb remedi wast under tsca the first altern would be self implement the term self implement mean that epa approv under tsca would not be necessari as long as the entir remedi conform to the procedur and standard of the first altern at propos 761 61 a the second altern perform base dispos is the use of tradit dispos technolog of inciner and chemic wast landfil accord to the approv process and standard as propos at 761 61 b the third altern risk base dispos is a process and decis document not unlik the superfund remedi action decis make process and record of decis rod each step would be approv by the region administr have jurisdict over the site which is contamin with pcbs includ a risk assess and ani onsit treatment or redisposit of treat or untreat remedi wast at the site treatment level would be base on a site specif risk assess describ at propos 761 61 c those seek a pcb dispos approv could also avail themselv of the coordin approv provis see unit iii 1 of this preambl this altern would allow the recognit of a cleanup action conduct under anoth author such as a rcra correct action permit or in complianc with a cercla rod or enforc decis document i self implement option the self implement altern is pattern after the pcb spill cleanup polici 40 cfr part 761 subpart g which set standard for clean up spill short after they occur like the pcb spill cleanup polici this propos altern requir that risk base surfac and soil level be achiev howev an import distinct between subpart g and the propos self implement altern is that for non recent spill there may be limit inform concern the concentr and amount of pcbs releas to the environ and the time natur and extent of that releas and ani subsequ migrat subpart g establish spill cleanup requir address the concentr and amount of spill materi base on the locat of the spill and potenti exposur to the spill pcbs spill cleanup in this propos is base on the current concentr in the materi onto which a spill occur the extent of migrat of the spill is like to be greater for an old spill than for a more recent or new spill this differ plus the requir for rapid initi and contain of the spill were part respons for the provis at 40 cfr 761 135 which creat a presumpt against an enforc action for penalti for the act of illeg dispos while the self implement propos allow dispos of remedi wast accord to the wast current exist concentr the propos doe not creat a presumpt against enforc action for penalti for the act of unauthor dispos anoth signific differ from subpart g is that the self implement dispos requir would not appli to certain environment and exposur scenario have the potenti for a high risk of exposur subpart g allow certain residu level to remain after cleanup base on the potenti futur use of the site includ the imposit of physic or institut restrict limit access which could have been incorrect assum to alway direct correl with exposur in those area today propos address residu level base not onli on access to area but also potenti exposur to residu pcb level within those area for exampl a restrict access commerci area might limit who could be expos but might not limit how much a person with access could be expos in this propos concret is not consid a non porous surfac as it is in subpart g see the propos definit of non porous surfac at 761 3 consequ concret contain pcbs would have to be remov rather than just wipe off the size of the remedi area is not an issu with today self implement propos as it is with subpart g the self implement option differenti between the cleanup of a site and the dispos of pcb remedi wast from the site cleanup mean the identif and reduct of the pcb concentr and or remov of pcb remedi wast to a specifi residu pcb concentr at it exist locat the cleanup portion of this altern allow remedi wast with specifi pcb level to remain undisturb at the site and not be dispos of cleanup may be follow by either or both off site dispos of a certain amount of pcb remedi wast or treatment of a certain amount of remedi wast at the site dispos mean the movement of pcb remedi wast from the site of contamin to anoth locat for destruct or contain off site dispos or the destruct or contain of pcb remedi wast at the cleanup site on site dispos section 761 61 would appli to the cleanup and dispos of all pcb remedi wast regardless of when the dispos spill or contamin occur subpart g would continu to appli to recent spill from electr equip howev the parti respons for the spill and cleanup could choos to follow 761 61 there are other conform chang which could be made to 40 cfr part 761 subpart g result from this propos these chang have not been made becaus those who were a parti to the negoti of subpart g have not been a direct parti to the develop of this propos nevertheless the conform chang to subpart g have been account for in this propos and the propos is consist with the conform chang especi with respect to refer of old spill section 761 61 specif appli to old spill the self implement remedi option propos on site dispos to specifi cleanup level of residu pcbs in the pcb remedi wast cleanup level would be more stringent for high exposur area than for low exposur area as these term would be defin in 761 3 three self implement on site option are propos cap higher residu level a definit of cap is propos at 761 3 treat down from higher level to lower level on site use a non chlorin solvent wash process and microencapsul or vitrif definit of these term are propos at 761 3 these last two immobil technolog are be propos becaus they have been promulg under rcra for debri which is contamin with both rcra hazard wast and tsca pcb wast see 57 fr 37194 37282

octob 30 1992 if adopt under tsca ani pcb remedi wast that has been microencapsul or vitrifi and subsequ shown to leach pcbs at less than 50 ppb as measur by the tclp would be consid appropri for dispos in a municip solid wast landfil after written notic to the municip solid wast landfil or dispos could be at a tsca approv dispos facil the treat pcb remedi wast would still be subject to all prohibit in the pcb rule includ but not limit to use reus export or the propos ban on open burn one comment to the anprm propos that epa use the american nation standard institut american nuclear societi leachabl test ansi an 16 1 to determin the effect of microencapsul or vitrif technolog the major technic differ between the two leach procedur are the amount of surfac area expos to the leach

given situat sinc this propos is focus on the releas of a toxic constitu from a matrix when co dispos with other solid wast in a municip solid wast landfil epa believ that the question of which test to use is more proper address in the solid and hazard wast regul under rcra than the pcb rule under tsca today propos self implement option for dispos of pcb remedi wast includ a differ way to evalu pcb concentr dure site remedi some field screen test have been develop and approv for use under epa test method for evalu solid wast sw 846 and have otherwis been wide use chemic other than pcbs at the remedi site may interfer with the test and indic that pcbs are not present when in fact pcbs are present a fals negat the correct applic of the test may still not inform or warn the user of the presenc of such interfer this propos includ the use of sever kind of pcb field screen test dure remedi so long as confirmatori sampl is use to guard against fals negat and to demonstr the absenc of interfer which would render the analyt result invalid the abil to obtain accept analyt result in a veri short time on site and while remedi is under way can complet remedi goal more quick and at lower cost the self implement option for the dispos of pcb remedi wast would offer one new consider for pcb dispos at 761 61 a 4 v allow non liquid wast generat by the cleanup process eg spent abras to be

leachabl base dispos as an altern to obtain a risk base tsca dispos approv under propos 761 62 c epa is propos under 761 62 b to allow the dispos of pcb non remedi wast in a municip solid wast landfil if the level of pcbs in the wast as measur by the toxic characterist leach procedur was less than 50 microgram per liter ie 50 ppb and the landfil is notifi in write at least 15 work day prior to

scrape or the use of abras to remov or separ pcbs from contamin surfac or liquid may be process for dispos as oppos to dispos epa is propos to waiv ani requir to obtain prior approv under tsca for these list activ epa also consid whether to includ distil in this exempt but remain concern about releas of volatil and semi volatil organ compound to the environ epa is seek comment on the inclus of distil all residu contain pcbs from these and other dispos activ would remain regul the propos standard for decontamin of solid surfac is the standard in the pcb spill cleanup polici at 761 125 c 2 i epa believ that 10 m g pcb 100 cm 2 is protect for dispos or subsequ reus of the decontamin surfac this standard has also been demonstr to epa through the pcb dispos approv process to be achiev through a wide varieti of techniqu the residu clean materi contain pcbs would be manag and dispos of as a pcb wast in accord with the applic pcb dispos regul in part 761 subpart d the note current follow 761 79 would be insert as introductori text under 761 79 to warn those conduct decontamin oper that complianc with this section would not reliev them of their duti to compli with other feder state or local requir for the use and dispos of solvent one exampl is the requir to compli with the rule for the dispos of wast identifi or list under rcra or state or local law as solid hazard or otherwis regul wast as an altern to decontamin follow by sampl for non porous surfac especi those that cannot be access for sampl epa is propos two non aggress procedur for decontamin the first procedur is for surfac contamin with miner oil dielectr fluid modef with pcb concentr 10 000 ppm see propos 761 79 e the second procedur is for surfac contamin with higher concentr of pcbs in modef and askarel pcbs see propos 761 79 f each procedur involv a 15 hour non aggress soak ie no agit of the kerosen or movement of the contamin surfac in the kerosen propos 761 79 f would requir a second soak with clean kerosen after decontamin use one of these procedur the decontamin surfac would not be regul for dispos and could be reus except in associ with food feed or drink water in accord with propos 761 20 c 5 epa research demonstr that these two non aggress procedur use kerosen should decontamin surfac to a level 10 m g 100 cm 2 therefor confirmatori sampl would not be requir epa is request comment support by laboratori data on aggress versus the propos non aggress decontamin techniqu especi where the volum of kerosen or anoth solvent propos by the comment can be reduc epa recogn that there is a possibl that the propos decontamin procedur may not result in final surfac level at or below 10 m g 100cm 2 for purpos of implement if epa subsequ sampl a decontamin surfac and found level abov 10 m g 100 cm 2 the surfac would be regul unless it could be shown by the owner ie through laboratori document that the origin pcb concentr were determin the prescrib procedur in 761 79 e or f were follow for those concentr of pcbs and the prescrib volum of pcb rinseat was use and proper dispos of ie through copi of the manifest and certif of dispos epa is also propos addit languag at 761 79 a to clarifi that the dispos of solvent abras or equip use in decontamin procedur is regul and is propos anoth dispos option specif dispos in an industri boiler for certain of those solvent the propos would also requir at 761 79 a 5 that all decontamin activ be conduct with contain adequ to prevent releas of pcbs to the environ epa is propos that ani decontamin activ conduct in accord with the provis of 761 79 would not requir a pcb dispos approv from epa worker would have to be protect against exposur through dermal contact or inhal howev epa is not specifi what measur must be taken the propos establish a decontamin standard for water of 05 microgram pcb per liter 05 m g l or approxim 05 ppb pcb see propos 761 79 g this standard is consist with epa drink water level for pcbs at 40 cfr 141 61 c epa is propos a 05 ppb decontamin standard becaus it is difficult to ensur that the decontamin water will not be reus in associ with food or feed or as drink water for livestock or human a conform amend at propos 761 20 c 6 would allow the unrestrict reus of water decontamin in accord with the level establish in 761 79 g the agenc believ that use of water at or below the propos decontamin level would not pose an unreason risk of injuri to health or the environ the propos also establish a decontamin standard for organ liquid not associ with remedi wast of less than 2 milligram pcb per liter ie 2 ppm pcb see propos 761 79 h epa believ that place these standard in the decontamin section will clarifi and simplifi the implement of the pcb program by specif defin level for decontamin and remov the prohibit against reus see 761 20 c 5 and 6 the propos introductori text to 761 60 state in part that pcb wast must be dispos of in accord with provis of this subpart epa interpret this to mean that ani pcb otherwis subject to the dispos requir of 761 60 may also be dispos of through decontamin under propos 761 79 8 distribut in commerc and use of decontamin equip structur and materi the agenc is propos a conform amend to the current provis of 761 20 c as an except to the general prohibit against the distribut in commerc and use of equip structur and materi unless they are decontamin under a tsca approv or the provis at propos 761 79 this amend is import becaus it caus the scope of the pcb prohibit in this section to among other thing specif conform to the current use of tsca dispos approv in establish decontamin or cleanup level see propos 761 20 c 4 epa also propos at 761 20 c 7 to exempt from the general prohibit on use of pcbs surfac eg equip which come in contact with pcbs or pcb wast at 50 ppm by allow it continu use until thw surfac exceed the appropri decontamin standard at which point it would have to be decontamin or dispos of the agenc believ that the further use or distribut in commerc of item decontamin or clean up to specif standard establish in applic epa pcb spill cleanup polici 761 79 or a tsca approv would not present an unreason risk of injuri if the decontamin item are not use or reus in associ with food feed or drink water for water a standard is be propos at 761 20 c 6 that is stringent enough to allow unrestrict distribut or reus of the decontamin water in 761 20 c 7 the agenc is propos to allow the restrict distribut or reus of solid nonpor surfac that have been contamin by regul pcbs if the final pcb concentr meet the decontamin standard propos at 761 79 d regardless of the origin concentr of the pcbs although ani liquid eg a solvent or solid eg an abras use for decontamin would remain regul the decontamin surfac could be distribut or reus pursuant to propos 761 20 c 5 and 6 9 process for dispos current 761 20 c 2 say in part that pcbs may be process in complianc with the requir of this

exist an extens to the 1 year storag and dispos requir could also be appropri for situat where the dispos capac or the time necessari to complet the dispos are insuffici this approach would provid

show by contact dispos facil nationwid and certifi that dispos capac is not avail for wast remain in storag mani comment also support extend or waiv the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos requir for materi like pcb radioact wast comment recommend extens for problem such as a lack of dispos or treatment technolog a lack of dispos or treatment capac and a lack of suffici time to complet the dispos process eg bioremedi epa in unit iii 3 of this preambl is propos to amend 40 cfr 761 65 to allow for self implement and case by case extens to the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos requir for ani pcb wast pcb radioact wast are includ in that propos propos 761 65 a 2 would provid the region administr for the region where the wast is be store or the director chemic manag divis cmd author to grant extens to the current 1 year time limit for storag and dispos of pcbs includ pcb radioact wast an extens could be grant base on a determin by the region administr or the director cmd that there was a demonstr need or justif to store or conduct dispos of wast beyond 1 year and that no unreason risk of injuri to health or the environ would result from an extens of the storag period criteria for extens would includ but not be limit to a demonstr need to store wast beyond the 1 year time frame due to a lack of dispos capac the absenc of a treatment technolog or insuffici time to complet the treatment destruct process and a demonstr that relev treatment or dispos requir are be pursu the problem of capac shortfal is expect to continu for some time after the dispos technolog has been develop becaus of the larg volum of store pcb radioact wast await dispos as an exampl of capac problem doe oper a region dispos facil at oak ridg tennesse for pcb rcra radioact mix wast fifti million pound of wast are current in storag for dispos at sever region site current generat rate at the various facil that reli on oak ridg for dispos are approxim 5 million pound per year the maximum dispos rate for the unit is approxim 09 million pound per year current project indic that it will take 30 to 50 year to dispos of the current materi in storag and all the wast yet to be generat use the facil as current configur ref 11 therefor doe is not expect to meet the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos requir even though it is pursu addit capac sever comment request that under tsca the pcb and radioact wast in a mixtur not be confus with the term mix wast under rcra epa agre and propos to appli the term pcb radioact wast or pcb fission radioact wast see propos definit at 761 3 as oppos to mix wast to wast contain pcbs and radioact constitu subject to regul under tsca and the aea epa disagre with those cement indic that there is no dispos technolog approv under tsca for pcb radioact wast inciner technolog is avail howev there is no commerci dispos capac and onli limit dispos capac for inciner of pcb radioact wast eg the doe inciner at oak ridg tn therefor facil store pcb radioact wast often cannot compli with the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos becaus insuffici dispos capac exist until addit dispos capac becom avail pcb radioact wast will requir storag general exceed the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos for pcbs even as capac increas there will still be request for extens of the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos becaus of the sheer volum of materi in storag therefor epa is not propos to place a specif time limit on the extens to the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos recipi of an extens to the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos would have to request if need and receiv from the region administr or director cmd period renew to their origin extens it is possibl that the same reason that appli to an origin extens request may appli to ani subsequ request becaus no progress in develop a dispos technolog has occur one comment state that annual status report for pcb radioact wast in storag for dispos should be requir and updat annual on juli 15 to coincid with the submiss of the pcb annual report for each facil status report or review of exist extens may be condit establish by the region administr or director cmd provid the extens sever comment suggest that epa amend 761 65 to accommod concern relat to manag and storag and the uniqu of pcb radioact wast there are certain element relat to storag of radioact wast contain plutonium or enrich uranium that requir consider of critic safeti ie the prevent of nuclear reaction that would pose a threat to health and the environ all action relat to critic or radiat protect issu must be coordin through and approv by the local offic of the regulatori author for radioact materi regul for licens nuclear facil this would be the appropri nrc region offic or state radiat protect author offic the issu of critic relat to proper storag of fission materi so that a continu self sustain chain reaction doe not occur doe order 5480 5 state that nuclear critic is a self sustain chain reaction ie the state in which the effect neutron multipl constant of a system of fission materi equal or exceed uniti proper storag of fission materi is essenti to avoid a critic event a self sustain chain reaction ie critic will not result in an atom explos howev it can result in the generat of harm radiat that can caus death or serious injuri ref 54 the issu of critic relat to the type of contain use to store the fission materi or suspect fission materi and the storag area epa is propos to amend 761 65 c 6 by allow an altern to the contain requir approv by the depart of transport dot for pcb fission radioact wast contain use to store liquid pcb fission radioact wast would have to be nonleak contain use to store both liquid and non liquid pcb fission radioact wast would need to be design to meet nuclear critic safeti requir such as those specifi in the american nation standard for nuclear critic safeti in oper with fissil materi outsid reactor ansi standard no

be use to store non liquid fission pcb radioact wast provid they are store in an area which would contain ani spill liquid if ani such contain were found to be leak their content would have to be transfer immedi to non leak contain and the leak or spill materi clean up take into account relev safeti procedur appropri for radioact materi epa is also propos to amend 761 65 b 1 ii to allow storag area for pcb fission radioact wast to meet perform criteria for contain volum rather than specif requir for curb height this amend would retain the current requir that facil store pcb fission radioact wast store those materi in a storag area meet the contain volum requir equal to at least two time the intern volum of the largest pcb contain store therein or 25 percent of the total intern volum of all pcb contain store therein or whichev is greater but would not impos curb height requir for these wast sever comment state that pcb radioact wast may also contain addit materi such as asbesto that cannot be inciner epa believ that technolog exist which allow pcbs to be separ from other materi eg radioact wast or asbesto epa recommend that whenev possibl pcbs be separ from other wast howev today propos doe not contain requir for separ pcbs becaus guidanc for separ pcbs from water for exampl alreadi exist epa had develop a polici allow the physic separ of pcbs from other wast so long as all wast part separ from the origin pcbs are regul tsca complianc program polici 6 pcb 2 one comment indic that epa doe not have the jurisdict to regul radioact pcbs under tsca epa agre in part and disagre in part tsca section 3 2 b iv state that the term chemic substanc doe not includ ani sourc materi special nuclear materi or byproduct materi as such term are defin in the atom energi act of

regulatori oversight for pcbs under tsca thus generat of pcb radioact wast must compli with both epa and nrc regul state requir or doe order mixtur of radioact pcb molecul and non radioact pcb molecul that cannot be separ are subject to tsca and the aea becaus for regulatori purpos when separ of the pcb molecul is not achiev the statutori exempt doe not extend to nonradioact pcbs in a mixtur it

rough a dozen comment and all but two support the establish of a household wast exempt some comment provid addit caveat on how such an exempt should be structur comment in favor of the household wast exempt essenti fell into four categori 1 broad defin the scope of the exempt 2 consid the impact of the exempt on recycl activ 3 limit the scope of the exempt and 4 address other dispos consider ie the dispos of materi contain pcbs use in the construct of residenti build comment not in favor of the tsca propos for an exempt question whether there should be a household wast exempt under either tsca or rcra and whether the volum of wast contain pcbs which was generat from household was signific enough to warrant an exempt epa respons to the four broad categori of comment are provid below a broad defin exempt those in favor of establish a household wast exempt suggest broad defin the activ that would qualifi for the exempt one comment suggest epa use the definit for municip solid wast found at 761 3 to defin the scope of the household wast exempt municip solid wast are defin as garbag refus sludg wast and other discard materi result from residenti and non industri oper and activ such as household activ offic function and commerci housekeep wast howev if such a chang was made the exempt would includ item epa believ should not be exclud from regul eg pcb wast from offic and commerci activ anoth comment state that commerci build should also be includ in a household wast exempt becaus the wast generat at these build may be from the same sourc and type of equip found in the household the effect of ban the manufactur process and distribut in commerc of pcbs coupl with action taken to limit the use of pcbs focus the agenc concern on activ where the continu use of pcbs has been author ie industri or commerci scale set such as util manufactur site construct renov demolit project etc rather than on household set where applianc with pcbs may not general be found ref 32 addit industri and commerci scale pcb dispos activ becaus of the risk associ with the greater volum of pcb wast generat by these activ requir a level of protect for health and the environ that can best be achiev through demonstr and effect pcb destruct and contain technolog therefor epa is not persuad that a broad defin household wast exempt encompass larg volum of commerci scale pcb wast would be protect of health and the environ b impact on recycl activ one comment state that the exempt should includ wast generat by household but divert or remov from the wastestream for purpos of recycl anoth comment state epa should control the recycl and storag of household wast eg increas the storag timefram from 1 to 2 year the final set of comment associ with this categori suggest epa take step to encourag municip collect program for pcbs the recycl of household wast contamin with pcbs surfac as a nation issu dure 1985 86 when the problem of pcb contamin in shredder fluff ie the non metal residu from the shred process was first identifi sinc that period epa has conduct a pilot studi of the shred industri to ascertain among other thing the sourc of the pcb contamin ref 34 when the fluff contamin problem first surfac pcb small capacitor in household applianc were thought to be the sourc of the contamin therefor data search collect activ were initi to determin the type of applianc that would most like contain pcb small capacitor the result of these effort indic that pcb small capacitor were not use in most household applianc howev epa determin that there was a signific likelihood that pcb small capacitor could be found in room and central air condition heat pump furnac blower fluoresc light ballast and microwav oven ref 32 and 33 as a result mani state have implement pcb small capacitor remov program to ensur that pcbs are not intent process dure shred oper in propos a tsca household wast exempt epa recogn that some object that contain a pcb compon may inadvert be shred result in fluff contain pcbs epa is propos at 761 62 b that this residu when test and found to be contamin at level of 50 ppm pcb or greater but measur less than 50 microgram per liter ppb when use rcras toxic characterist leach procedur see 40 cfr part 261 appendix ii may be dispos of in a facil that is permit licens or regist by a state as a municip or industri wast landfil howev shredder residu when test and found to contain 50 ppm or greater pcbs must be manag pursuant to the current dispos requir at 761 60 addit dispos option for this type of wast are propos at 761 62 and discuss at unit ii 5 of this preambl under the current regul the process and distribut in commerc of pcbs is prohibit unless otherwis author by rulemak or under a pcb exempt the propos household wast exempt author these activ for household wast contain pcbs the process of non exempt non household item such as commerci or industri grade applianc contain pcbs fixtur from renov or demolit project and industri or heavi duti equip contain pcbs would continu to be a violat of the pcb regul epa is not encourag the process and subsequ dilut of pcbs by recycl facil in a may 31 1979 feder regist notic epa explain that the random dispos of pcb equip in municip solid wast site by household and other infrequ dispos did not present an environment hazard 44 fr 31528 on the other hand epa determin that the dispos of larg quantiti of pcb small capacitor pose a somewhat larger risk and commerci and industri activ were encourag to establish a voluntari collect and dispos program epa would therefor includ in the household wast exempt wastestream creat by recycl oper that accept onli wast compos of household item from privat resid see the discuss under unit ii c limit scope of the exempt of this preambl therefor the owner or oper of a recycl facil should establish contractu requir or other appropri notif or inspect procedur to ensur that pcb wast not cover under the exempt eg commerci or industri applianc contain pcbs or fixtur from demolit or renov project industri or heavi duti equip contain pcbs were not process at the facil in ani event the owner or oper of such a facil would be subject to an enforc action should such wast be process municip collect program accept onli those wast that satisfi the propos exempt criteria could oper under the tsca household wast exempt the tsca chemic wast landfil and inciner requir would not appli to the dispos of these wast see the discuss under unit ii c limit scope of the exempt of this preambl becaus dispos of the wast collect under a municip solid wast program that satisfi the criteria propos for the exempt would not be regul by this rule the wast could be dispos of in a facil which is permit licens or regist by a state to manag municip or industri wast as a result the commerci storag approv requir and complianc with the tsca pcb 1 year time limit for storag and dispos limit would not appli therefor epa doe not see a need to extend the storag timefram from 1 to 2 year as suggest by one comment c limit scope of the exempt a few comment stress the need to restrict the applic of a household wast exempt to pure residenti set in order to exclud busi activ that take place in a resid anoth comment believ the exempt should be ident to the rcra household wast exclus epa has interpret the rcra subtitl c rule at 40 cfr 261 4 as limit the exclus to those household wast that meet two criteria 1 the wast must be generat by individu on the premis of either a temporari or perman household and 2 the wast must be compos primarili of materi found in wast generat by consum in their home the rcra exclus at 40 cfr 261 4 b includ household wast from singl and multipl dwell hotel and motel and other residenti sourc the rcra hazard wast program in establish a household wast exclus act upon a congression intent to ensur that wast generat by consum in their household would be exempt from the subtitl c regul as a result the rcra exclus includ materi from singl and multipl resid hotel motel bunkhous ranger station crew quarter campground picnic ground and day use recreat area locat at which consum activ is of a type that would be conduct in a residenti set and result in the generat of hazard wast as comment have suggest epa is propos an exempt under tsca for the dispos of household wast contain pcbs that is similar but not ident to the rcra exclus like the rcra exclus the tsca exempt would not includ non residenti pcb wast such as commerci or industri grade applianc contain pcbs fixtur from demolit or renov project and industri or heavi duti pcb equip under tsca congress sought to elimin the use of pcbs unless specif author by ban their continu manufactur process and distribut in commerc howev congress intend that the use of equip which contain pcbs in a total enclos manner not be termin prior to the end of the equip use life as state earlier research conduct by epa suggest that some refriger and household freezer room and central air condition heat pump furnac blower fluoresc light ballast and microwav oven may contain pcb small capacitor the risk associ with the dispos of those item contain pcb small capacitor in a random geograph dispers manner by individu homeown were consid by epa in mid 1977 when it propos the pcb small capacitor exempt epa has re evalu this issu twice subsequ to that time and has determin that the exempt should remain in place see the discuss at unit ii c of this preambl the distinct that epa make between the tsca household wast exempt which focus on consum product use by individu in privat resid and the rcra household wast exclus which focus on consum activ conduct by privat individu in temporari or perman resid is base on the continu belief that the unregul dispos of larg quantiti of pcb item such as light ballast and pcb small capacitor by commerci and industri activ present an environment risk see 42 fr 26568 may 24 1977 43 fr 7152 februari 17 1978 44 fr 31528 may 31 1979 and the discuss on the dispos of small capacitor at unit ii c of this preambl under rcra the risk associ with consum activ that result in the generat of hazard wast do not chang when the activ are conduct in a singl or multipl resid hotel motel bunkhous ranger station crew quarter campground picnic ground or day use recreat area these are all locat at which the consum activ is of a type that would be conduct in a residenti set for the pcb household wast exempt under tsca epa believ that the unregul dispos by individu household of consum product which contain pcbs should be exempt from the tsca dispos requir becaus there are relat few household product that would contain pcbs the propos exempt would not appli to individu who resid in transient set becaus they would like not dispos of household applianc that would contain pcbs eg certain refriger and household freezer room and central air condition heat pump furnac blower fluoresc light ballast and microwav oven rather equip contain pcbs obtain for use in transient set would like be of a commerci grade and dispos of in quantiti therefor the remov and dispos of equip contain pcb small capacitor by commerci activ and entrepreneuri interest such as hotel and motel chain and owner of multipl unit residenti build engag in repair renov and or demolit project would not be cover by this exempt epa consid exclud from the tsca household wast exempt pcb wast found in a home base busi but has determin that pcb item found in a privat resid would like be evid in these smaller busi enterpris as well that is industri scale manufactur activ would not normal be conduct in a residenti set if howev such was the case onli those pcb item common found in a privat household would be cover by this exempt although epa propos to establish an exempt under tsca for the dispos of household wast the public is remind of the cercla report requir for pcbs at 40 cfr 302 6 that essenti requir individu to contact the nation respons center when they are dispos of 1 pound or more of pcbs in ani 24 hour period in a non feder permit facil the tsca household wast exempt doe not reliev an individu ie the person dispos of the wast and or the owner of the dispos facil of the liabil for remedi pcb contamin if the non feder permit dispos facil becom a futur superfund site therefor epa is seek comment on whether addit limit should be impos when defin entiti that would qualifi for this exempt d other dispos consider one comment although not object to the exempt suggest epa should focus on the previous residenti applic of pcbs such as a wall paint with pcb contain paint and the item sale destruct and dispos the propos tsca household wast exempt would not appli to debri produc dure build construct renov or

while the bureau did not specifi how such cabl should be made experi with naval vessel indic that such cabl could have been manufactur with pcbs to meet the test standard some of this cabl may still be in use or may be abandon with other electr equip in mine storag area or in close mine an environment hazard would exist if the cabl is improp dispos of a hazard to worker would exist from inhal of

below 50 ppm epa determin that b ecaus of the small quantiti and low concentr of pcbs involv this author will not result in exposur to pcbs that present an unreason risk to health or the environ in

pcbs which in most case and in particular when store pcb radioact wast may not be the best altern see discuss at unit ii c pcb radioact wast epa is propos to amend 761 60 b 2 vi and 761 65 c 6 by defer to the dot contain requir for the storag and transport of pcbs epa propos to elimin all citat to specif contain type and to cross refer the new perform base dot contain requir set forth in the dot hazard materi regul hmr at 49 cfr part 171 180 epa regul pcbs at a much lower concentr than dot therefor epa would also like to emphas that although some materi may not be subject to dot regul part 761 would still requir these materi to be packag in accord with the dot regul that is in dot author contain pcbs are shown in the hazard materi tabl at 49 cfr 172 101 in pack group ii howev under those regul pcbs that are transport by highway or rail need onli be packag pursuant to pack group iii pcb radioact pcb fission materi pcb mix wast and pcb hazard wast not packag in accord with the hmr are not allow to be transport addit reader are advis that the hmr as amend on decemb 21 1990 55 fr 52402 prohibit the construct of dot specif packag previous design for the storag of pcb wast ie dot specif 5 5b 6d 17c 17e and 17h contain effect octob 1 1994 further transport of pcbs in these outdat dot specif contain is not author beyond septemb 30 1996 although most comment agre with epa decis to defer to dot one comment suggest that epa continu to list all contain author by dot howev such an approach would defeat epa object in amend the pcb rule which are to provid flexibl to industri and to minim the resourc burden associ with updat the pcb regul each time dot modifi it requir c definit of a pcb transform and pcb contamin electr equip the propos amend to the definit of a pcb transform at 761 3 provid pcb transform mean ani transform that contain 500 ppm pcbs or greater a transform is a pcb transform if the namepl indic that the transform contain pcb dielectr fluid the owner or oper has ani reason to believ that the transform contain pcb dielectr fluid or the transform dielectr fluid has been test and found to contain pcbs at 500 ppm or greater a transform is assum to be a pcb transform if the transform doe not have a namepl record do not exist that indic the type of dielectr fluid or record do not exist that indic the pcb concentr in order to clarifi the current definit of pcb contamin electr equip specif pcb contamin transform within this definit at 761 3 epa is propos incorpor into this definit the provis of the assumpt rule in this preambl to the pcb to the pcb ban rule 44 fr 31517 may 31 1979 epa inspector have suspect that some owner of transform are abus the assumpt rule to avoid the stricter dispos requir of 761 60 an exampl of such an avoid techniqu is the remov of the manufactur namepl or other identifi inform that could be use to classifi a transform as pcb addit the possibl exist that a transform may have been servic with fluid contain 500 ppm pcbs or greater for purpos of clarif record as use abov refer to servic record manufactur certif and or other data that would indic or impact pcb concentr general comment express support for epa effort to clarifi the exist definit of a pcb transform in addit the current definit of pcb contamin electr equip at 761 3 which includ oil fill electr equip has been misinterpret to mean that a transform with ani oil in it could be assum to be pcb contamin 50 to 499 ppm to further clarifi this definit the agenc is propos to add the word miner befor the word oil fill in addit languag would be ad to this definit which state that a transform is assum to contain pcbs at 500 ppm or greater if it is an untest miner oil transform and reason exist to believ that the transform was at ani time servic with fluid contain pcbs at 500 ppm or greater histor miner oil transform encompass the vast major of non askarel transform howev over time the type of non askarel transform have expand to includ for exampl silicon fill transform ad this clarif would reestablish the agenc intent when this definit was ad to the regul in august of 1982 46 fr 37342 that miner oil fill transform are assum to be pcb contamin 50 to 499 ppm some comment suggest that instead of amend the definit the agenc should consid requir that these unit be test prior to dispos other comment that epa should provid immun from enforc action to owner who assum their oil fill electr equip was pcb contamin electr equip when it was later determin that the transform contain pcbs at 500 ppm or greater while the cost of test have decreas sinc 1979 epa is not propos to chang it long stand polici which doe not requir test transform prior to dispos while the equip is in use nonetheless owner of electr equip contain pcbs should consid verifi the concentr prior to dispos to avoid violat of tsca in addit epa is not propos to issu a blanket exempt from enforc action for use of a miner oil transform assum to contain less than 500 ppm pcbs but later found to contain pcbs at 500 ppm or greater the regul at 761 30 a 1 xv current describ procedur for bring such transform into complianc with the use author provis for exampl in order to

is seek inform regard number of small transform or other electr equip that contain pcbs these small transform or other type of small electr equip general do not have namepl and are not easili sampl some exampl of this type of equip are potenti transform current transform instrument transform ground transform voltag transform and ignit transform these small transform can rang in size from sever inch to sever feet in height such small transform can be fill with oil epoxi or tar like pot compound that contain pcbs or they could be dri sinc these small transform general do not have a namepl under the propos amend to 761 3 they would have to be assum to be pcb transform and would be subject to the use requir at 761 30 a and the dispos requir at 761 60 a the agenc is also solicit comment regard the dispos requir that could be impos on these small transform or other similar type of small electr equip their dispos requir could resembl those for small capacitor eg 3 pound of dielectr fluid 761 60 b 2 ii or could be expand to includ the size physic dimens or the total weight of the equip as well such small transform or similar small electr equip meet the size or weight condit could

equip is unregul for dispos under the exist regul at 761 60 b 4 and may be salvag through smelt a process recogn by epa as an accept form of dispos when certain condit are met epa solicit comment in the anprm on whether the agenc should consid amend the regul for the dispos of drain pcb contamin electr equip to ensur that the equip is proper dispos of and is not illeg reus possibl remedi such as decontamin and stricter control to ensur that unit were complet drain were not well receiv by comment in particular most comment state that the anecdot inform that drain pcb contamin electr equip carcass were use for barbecu grill reflect isol instanc of non complianc consid the low potenti exposur to human and the environ and the valuabl metal that could be salvag for recycl epa is propos to modifi the dispos requir at 761 60 b 4 for drain pcb contamin electr equip by includ this equip under the propos general ban against open burn of pcbs and allow dispos onli in facil that are permit licens or regist by a state to manag municip or industri wast exclud thermal treatment unit in an industri furnac or in a tsca approv dispos facil see unit ii 2 of this preambl final epa also propos to add languag to 761 60 b 4 which state that for a period of not less than 48 hour equip should be allow to drain so that as much liquid as possibl is remov from the equip to further reduc pcb content prior to dispos e transfer of total enclos pcbs under current rule pcb item with concentr of 50 ppm or greater sold befor juli 1 1979 for purpos other than resal may be distribut in commerc in

request comment in the anprm on the requir that record be maintain on these transact general comment were veri support of the requir that record be maintain to document the distribut in commerc of these item with the propos recordkeep requir at 761 180 a 2 ix epa seek to prevent illeg dispos of pcb item includ pcb and pcb contamin transform and larg capacitor by those who explain the disappear of such item by claim a sale has occur to minim the potenti for illeg dispos epa is propos that the name address and phone number of the parti to which the item was transfer the date of transfer and the identifi number of the item be record in the annual document log for ani distribut in commerc of a pcb item exclud small capacitor with a concentr of 50 ppm or greater in addit epa suggest that summari inform relev to the equip eg pcb content servic and inspect record and it complianc with applic section of part 761 be pass on to the new owner epa had anticip in the anprm that this recordkeep requir would be impos pursuant to a sale howev in order to avoid claim that the transact is exempt from the propos recordkeep requir becaus it involv no transfer of money epa is propos to requir that ani transfer of ownership result in the transform or other pcb item be distribut in commerc be includ in the recordkeep requir the intent behind this propos recordkeep requir is to identifi instanc of illeg dispos hidden behind the guis of a transfer of ownership as such epa is seek to requir addit inform on transact which result in the remov of the transform and capacitor from the properti in this propos epa would not requir the annual document log to identifi the transfer of ownership of pcb item exclud small capacitor with a concentr of 50 ppm or greater when that transfer was includ in a real estat transfer for exampl a compani sell a warehous and the surround properti as long as the transform and capacitor were transfer in the same transact as the real estat a separ log of the transact would not be necessari a few comment to the anprm suggest that the sale of total enclos electr equip should be ban outright epa believ that the sale or transfer of total enclos pcb item should not be ban and that there is still a legitim need for such equip howev epa believ that addit control are need to ensur proper dispos of such equip one comment state that a recordkeep requir would be imposs sinc not all pcb item eg pcb contamin transform or larg capacitor are mark with a serial number although epa propos that the record includ the serial number of the equip the absenc of a serial number should not preclud epa from trace an illeg dispos therefor epa is propos that ani intern identif number that the compani use to identifi the specif pcb item be includ in the record ani facil with pcb item exclud small capacitor with a concentr of 50 ppm or greater not equip with manufactur identif number should develop some mechan for identifi those piec of equip for activ such as mainten or quarter inspect the propos would requir perman mark such as engrav of an intern identifi number in a promin locat on the equip as a mean of identifi this equip absent a manufactur identif the compani own identif number would have to be document on the record sever comment recommend that the recordkeep requir be includ in the annual record requir at 761 180 a epa agre that this would be an appropri method of maintain the record of a transfer of ownership of a pcb item exclud small capacitor with a concentr of 50 ppm or greater therefor epa is propos to implement this requir by ad paragraph ix to 761 180 a 2 f chang in report quantiti spill cleanup polici in attempt to provid more consist with other feder statut epa solicit comment on whether 761 125

consist with cercla g pcb storag requir 1 indefinit storag of pcb articl design for reus epa regul specif state at 40 cfr 761 65 a that ani pcb articl or pcb contain that are store for dispos shall be remov from storag and dispos of within 1 year from the date when it was first place into storag howev there current is no compar provis in the regul that address the length of time a pcb articl may be store for reus further epa has been made awar of situat where pcb transform and pcb contamin transform have been held in storag for reus well beyond a time when it is reason to expect the equip could be reus this storag is be done under the pretext that the equip is be retain as spare for critic compon of exist electr system or that at some futur date the owner will servic the unit it was not epa intent to allow pcb articl that clear could not be reus due to their state of disrepair and therefor should be dispos of to remain in storag for reus this activ constitut illeg dispos and creat addit risk of environment exposur to pcbs while the equip is in storag for reus epa is awar howev that there are mani legitim instanc which warrant the storag of pcb equip for mani year for the purpos of reus as spare for critic compon of electr system these are typic intact and nonleak pcb articl which are treat as if they were in servic mani comment receiv in respons to the anprm suggest that limit storag for reus would in effect amount to a new use restrict without ani appar basi from the standpoint of protect of health and the environ nevertheless epa is awar of other situat for which restrict are warrant to minim potenti risk to the environ and health from exposur to pcb articl which are be store for reus there are mani compel reason for allow the storag for reus of pcb articl sinc transform for exampl can easili have an activ servic life of more than 40 year dispos of this equip prematur base upon an arbitrari time limit would not be econom prudent nor serv ani environment goal place such a piec of electr equip in storag for reus to be use as a spare or in emerg situat is both prudent and econom sound epa is propos to minim the potenti risk associ with the storag for reus of this equip that onc it is place in storag for reus it be treat as if it were in use ie in servic comment provid a number of scenario in which extend storag for reus is warrant 1 some pcb articl are design and manufactur for veri specif use and size requir and for which replac is imper for the continu uninterrupt oper of a facil ie power rectifi to convert electr power to a usabl form for specif manufactur oper side mount bush etc 2 certain industri must maintain inventori of all vintag of spare equip for exampl owner of locomot and stationari pcb transform often maintain these unit in storag for reus for a number of year prior to reinstal and reus the transform 3 aircraft and airport oper requir airport safeti and facil oper flexibl and expedi mainten capabl 4 chang in facil ownership or busi transact may result in the prematur storag of some pcb articl 5 there may also be difficulti forecast electr demand or specialti need and obtain part for repair which are not readili avail and 6 if spare of older design that had been remov from servic for reus could not be maintain signific chang to system design would be necessari and in servic equip would have to be replac although epa take these mani factor and situat into consider there are nevertheless situat where the storag for reus polici is abus this abus result or has the potenti to result in serious environment damag it is these situat which the agenc is seek to control by limit the time allow for storag for reus and impos other safeguard certain type of busi by their natur eg broker junk yard servic shop etc accumul larger quantiti or volum of pcbs than owner or user eg a util or industri facil besid accumul larg volum of pcb equip that in mani case are in disrepair and may not be intact and non leak these busi have no intent of reus the equip themselv the equip may be await repair prior to some futur resal or may be in storag for reus prior to purg for metal reclam in mani case these unit in storag for reus remain for year in locat that are expos to the element which further compromis the integr of the unit therefor epa is propos to add new 761 67 to limit storag for reus in an area that was not design construct and oper in complianc with 761 65 b for a maximum of 3 year from the date a pcb articl was taken out of servic or 3 year from the effect date of the final rule whichev is later pcb articl place into storag for reus would have to be label at the time the pcb articl were taken out of servic or upon the effect date of the final rule and place into storag for reus in addit the storag for reus of ani pcb articl would have to compli with all mark and recordkeep regul inform requir on these label would includ the date the equip was place into storag for reus or the effect date of the final rule if the other date is not known a project locat for the futur use of the equip and the date the equip was schedul for repair or servic if appropri individu would be requir upon request of an epa inspector to provid record of the potenti use for the store articl a descript of ani leak contain precaut and the pcb status pcb or pcb contamin of the pcb articl pcb articl that are intend to be store for reus for a period longer than 3 year would have to be dispos of unless the person store the pcb articl had request and receiv from the region administr for the region in which the articl is locat a written approv for an extens of the 3 year period anyon request an extens would be requir to do so in write to the region administr no later than 6 month prior to the expir of the storag for reus period request for an extens of the storag period must includ the rational for exceed the storag limit on an articl by articl basi all extens request would be subject to approv by the region administr and ani condit the region administr deem necessari to protect health or the environ a record of these evalu would have to be kept at the storag site for a minimum of 3 year epa also request comment on the inclus of site specif or nationwid exempt or waiver provis in addit to the propos waiver provis one option for store equip would be to reclassifi the equip in storag for reus epa in anoth rulemak is current consid modif to the reclassif regul to facilit a widespread applic of the reclassif procedur such an approach would signific reduc the risk that might be pose by the longterm storag for reus of pcb or pcb contamin equip pcb equip that is reclassifi to non pcb status ie 50 ppm would not be subject to ani of the storag for reus restrict propos today epa recommend that owner and user or broker and servic of pcb equip develop their own reus or reclassif schedul to account for proper retain equip the schedul should includ a simpl inventori to aid in monitor the status of the equip this may includ the reclassif schedul and or the purpos for store for reus one question rais in respons to the anprm was whether the time between a piec of equip remov from servic for repair and it return to the owner is consid storag for reus until a determin is made that the piec of equip can or cannot be repair ani storag of that piec of electr equip prior to such a determin is consid storag for reus the owner of malfunct equip that has been sent off site for repair will still be subject to the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos begin on the date it was determin the equip could not be repair although servic facil may hold unit for sever month while schedul the unit for repair epa view prolong storag in such situat as an abus of the storag provis record must be maintain by the servic for review by pcb inspector of the date of receipt of the equip for repair the type of malfunct and the anticip date for return of the equip to the owner or user 2 clarif of the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos epa propos to clarifi the requir at 761 65 a that state that a pcb articl or pcb contain must be dispos of within 1 year from the date the item is first place into storag epa is propos to amend the languag at 761 65 a to explicit state epa origin intent that the 1 year period begin on the date when the equip is taken out of servic and design for dispos when it is determin by a servic for exampl that the equip cannot be repair not when the equip is place into storag for dispos current the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos of drum which are use to collect liquid from various pcb articl and for other contain use to store the accumul of pcb wast such as oil rag booti cleanup debri etc start on the day an item is first place into the contain for storag for dispos epa is not propos to allow the accumul in contain of these item for period of greater than 1 year except as propos in unit iii 3 of this preambl current this wast has to be store in contain howev comment suggest that this is not a common practic and may lead to disagr within the regul communiti therefor epa is propos to chang the languag at 761 65 a from pcb articl and pcb contain to pcbs or pcb item to effect captur all storag scenario for transform that are taken out of servic but are not drain until later the 1 year clock for both the oil and the transform start when the transform is taken out of servic and design for dispos ie the date of remov from servic for dispos epa also want to clarifi that the start date for the 1 year period for dispos and ani other applic requir for pcbs legal return into the unit state for dispos see unit ii h and propos 761 20 b 3 is the date the pcbs reach the port of entri in the continent unit state or the date the pcbs reach the port of entri if the dispos facil is outsid the continent unit state or if the wast is store dure transport for more than 10 day in a state this polici appli to certain pcbs to includ wast contain pcbs at less than 50 ppm which are import for dispos the polici also appli to pcbs purchas in the unit state by the us govern taken oversea for use includ ani wast direct result from the remedi of these pcbs and subsequ return to the unit state for dispos in an approv facil from us embassi us militari instal other us govern instal or territori and pcbs import under ani feder administr order issu under tsca or ani feder court action 3 situat which warrant an extens or waiver of the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos in the june 10 1991 anprm epa solicit comment on whether an extens of the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos requir would be appropri in situat for exampl innov pcb destruct technolog such as biolog treatment technolog that may take more than 1 year to achiev accept level and the absenc of dispos capac specif for pcb radioact wast comment on altern option procedur and or restrict for deal with such situat were also request epa receiv sever comment most of which support the establish of a provis which would allow the region administr for the region in which the materi is store or the director cmd if the director issu the permit to recogn situat which requir more than the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos and to grant an extens to the requir comment also identifi other situat for which they believ equal consider should be given to extend the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos these situat includ 1 technolog such as thermal separ thermal desorpt and bioremedi that requir more than 1 year to process wast at a remedi site 2 limit expedit remedi action undertaken ahead of the main remedi effort and 3 conflict remedi or dispos requir associ with the presenc of certain co regul wast from which the pcbs cannot be separ ie such as mine cabl coat with a solid anti foul compound contain both pcbs and mercuri most comment support the ground for extens cite in the anprm justif of need demonstr that treatment dispos option are be pursu and the submiss of period progress report other comment offer variat on the epa propos includ 1 modifi regul to allow doe to seek an extens on a complex wide multifacil basi to address

grant extens 4 make the extens effect upon submiss of the request or altern make the extens automat if the agenc doe not object within 90 day and 5 elimin the 1 year limit for extens epa has consid these suggest and is propos sever chang to 761 65 a first criteria for extend the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos requir includ but are not limit to a demonstr need to store wast beyond the 1 year time limit due to a lack of dispos capac the absenc of a treatment technolog or insuffici time to complet the treatment destruct process and a demonstr that relev treatment or dispos requir are be pursu addit criteria for pcb radioact wast pcb fission radioact wast or rcra mix wast and pcb rcra wast could also be requir to compli with the requir of the appropri feder ie nuclear regulatori commiss or epa or state regulatori author anyon store pcb wast that was subject to the 1 year time limit could provid written notif to the region administr for the region in which the pcb wast was store that they had been unsuccess in their continu attempt to dispos of their wast within the 1 year time limit and could receiv an extens for one addit year provid certain condit were met second the region administr could grant addit extens of 1 year or longer upon receipt of a justifi request third epa would consid includ site specif time frame for storag and dispos where appropri when approv a tsca pcb storag or dispos applic or a modif to a previous issu approv see 761 60 e or 761 65 d howev epa is less recept to allow organ to develop complex wide ie nationwid justif and or report of their storag and dispos activ if the data were allow to be submit in an aggreg form resourc would be requir to disaggreg the inform and transmit the data to the appropri region administr nonetheless epa would consid aggreg of these data on a region basi for submiss to and approv by the region administr for the region in which the materi are store final under the propos epa may impos condit when approv request for an extens these condit would vari due to the specif of each situat therefor it is not possibl to list everi conceiv requir that could be impos on a facil in grant addit or longer extens epa is propos that the region administr or the director cmd may requir ani inform deem necessari to ensur protect of health and the environ and may likewis requir that addit step be taken dure the storag period such as mark inspect recordkeep or financi assur or compli with alara principl for pcb radioact wast to protect health or the environ epa wish to make a distinct between those situat for which an extens of the storag and dispos requir may be legitim see exampl 3 abov versus those situat that would result in the abus of such an extens such as the accept of pcb wast in excess of the capac limit impos either by the permit or the physic constraint of the technolog be use epa doe not believ an extens of the storag and dispos requir is warrant becaus of failur to initi attempt to obtain dispos capac the cost of dispos or to allow for the aggreg by multipl generat of pcb wast into one vehicl for shipment epa is not modifi it view that pcb wast should be proper manag and dispos of as quick as possibl and therefor is not inclin to take step that would reliev the generat of it respons to remov the pcbs from the environ in a time manner on the other hand individu engag in on site remedi activ are most like conduct those activ in accord with some instrument develop by epa anoth feder agenc or a state that provid instruct on what how the project is to be conduct and when the project is to be complet as the case may be for exampl 1 and 2 abov in these instanc the tsca pcb permit and 1 year time limit for storag and dispos may not appli also see the discuss regard the coordin approv provis at unit iii k of this preambl epa would also consid extens request to be legitim when an individu abil to store and dispos of pcbs within the 1 year is inhibit by other feder or state dispos remedi requir eg rcra cercla the clean water act cwa the clean air act caa or ani statut govern remedi action which involv pcbs at or deriv from feder regul level 4 temporari storag of

ppm in an area that doe not meet the requir of paragraph b of that section for up to 30 day from the date of their remov from use in the case of liquid pcbs a spill prevent control and countermeasur spcc plan must be in place for the temporari storag area in accord with 40 cfr part 112 the current regul howev do not author temporari storag of liquid contain pcbs with a concentr of 500 ppm or greater howev the current regul at 761 20 c 2 author the process and distribut in commerc of pcbs and pcb item greater than 50 ppm for purpos of dispos the agenc doe not believ that there are signific risk associ with temporarili store for dispos pcb liquid at concentr greater than 500 ppm provid the wast is in contain meet dot specif and an spcc plan is implement in the anprm epa suggest two approach to amend the regul to allow the temporari storag of liquid greater than 500 ppm 1 to add a provis to allow temporari storag of liquid with concentr of 500 ppm or greater at 761 65 c 1 or 2 to consid the hold store of this liquid as a step in the dispos process most comment support the option of amend the temporari storag provis at 761 65 c as oppos to amend the provis at 761 20 c which allow the process and distribut in commerc of pcbs and pcb item for dispos mani comment also suggest increas the 30 day time allot for temporari storag the agenc believ it is appropri to extend the allow for temporari storag for dispos of liquid pcb wast abov 500 ppm but not beyond the exist 30 day limit the point of the 30 day temporari storag provis is to allow for the accumul of wast prior to shipment to a dispos facil or commerci storag facil this rational should also appli to liquid abov 500 ppm especi when one consid the preponder of pcb transform owner who are opt for reclassif of these unit to have them build or ship to a formal storag area in each instanc would be unduli burdensom epa is propos that the 30 day temporari provis at 761 65 c 1 be extend to liquid at 500 ppm or greater provid an spcc plan is in place and the liquid wast is in stationari bulk storag tank exclud roll stock such as but not limit to tanker truck or dot specif contain 5 storag of larg pcb

pcb larg high voltag capacitor 761 65 c 2 in today propos epa is propos to delet 761 65 c 2 from the pcb regul sinc the octob 1 1988 phaseout date 761 30 l 1 for most use of pcb larg high voltag capacitor has pass and there should no longer be a need for addit storag space for this type of equip in addit epa doe not believ that this provis is need for pcb contamin electr equip becaus this equip is typic drain prior to dispos and the drain hull or carcass is not subject to the storag for dispos provis of 761 65 the current pcb regul do not prohibit expans of the storag capac of a given storag area as long as in the case of commerci storag facil the closur plan and financi assur mechan are also adjust to reflect the increas amount of wast store at the facil epa believ that the delet of this provis for storag on pallet next to a qualifi storag area will not result in undu hardship on exist storag facil epa is solicit comment on the appropri of delet this provis and also seek inform from storer of pcb wast as to whether they are current util the provis of 761 65 c 2 6 altern storag of pcbs epa is propos a modif at 761 65 b 2 to the storag requir to allow the storag of pcbs and pcb item design for dispos in wast manag unit permit by epa under section 3004 of rcra or by a state author under section 3006 of rcra to manag hazard wast in contain this propos would also allow the storag in unit otherwis regul by a state under a tsca look alik law or approv as part of a pcb dispos approv epa believ that the rcra requir for permit contain storag unit provid an equal level of

store instead under the term and condit of a pcb dispos approv it may not be feasibl or desir to construct a pcb storag area where larg volum of pcb remedi wast or pcb item are concern epa view storag and dispos of pcb wast as a continuum and believ this issu of storag of larg volum wast is best address on a case by case basi through the pcb approv or other permit process howev anyon subject to the pcb storag requir could choos to follow 761 65 b 1 and not avail themselv of these other option 7 storag requir for pcb articl contain under 761 65 c 5 pcb articl and pcb contain are requir to be check period for leak and 761 65 c 8 requir that they be date when they are place into storag by not includ pcb articl contain in 761 65 c 5 and c 8 a loophol exist that allow a storag unit owner to omit date and inspect these contain and to circumv the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos requir therefor epa is propos to correct this oversight by replac the phrase pcb articl and pcb contain with pcb item wherev it occur in 761 65 c 5 and c 8 8 recordkeep requir for storag unit oper certain addit recordkeep requir for storag unit oper are be propos under 761 180 a 1 and b 1 the first addit would be to requir the oper to maintain a record of the inspect for leak and cleanup that must be perform under 761 65 c 5 current epa inspector have no way to verifi that unit oper are compli with these requir in addit epa is propos that storag unit oper keep an up to date written inventori or log of what they are current hold in their unit the annual log requir similar inform but sinc it is an annual summari it doe not reflect what is actual in a unit on a given day and thus is of no assist to an epa inspector perform a site inspect although this would be an addit recordkeep requir epa believ that it would not place ani addit burden on unit oper epa believ that most oper maintain some sort of inventori mainten of such is almost a necess to proper manag a facil as well as to ensur complianc with the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos deadlin and to collect data for the annual log allow epa inspector access to this inventori would great facilit on site inspect particular at larger facil also sinc the purpos of this inventori is to facilit on site inspect epa is requir that the inventori be maintain on site at the storag unit rather than at a central facil this requir to maintain the inventori on site appli onli to this inventori and affect no other portion on the annual record 9 revis to storag unit criteria propos 761 65 b 1 iv would reflect the propos definit of porous surfac found at 761 3 this propos definit includ concret and cement within the definit of porous surfac the refer to portland cement or concret in 761 65 b 1 iv as impervi

implement an expand pcb program under it rcra author or to establish a tsca look alik pcb dispos program in addit action taken under ani feder author eg rcra or cercla to requir remedi of pcb contamin could also be recogn as not pose an unreason risk of injuri and thus suitabl for a tsca pcb coordin approv one comment although support the concept of regul pcb dispos activ under an expand state hazard wast program for stationari technolog encourag epa to maintain central control over pcb mobil technolog howev such an approach is not accept to epa sinc there are limit situat wherebi the administr can preempt the state author to regul pcb dispos activ although the tsca pcb coordin approv provis would not requir the owner or oper of a mobil or multipl but ident stationari unit to obtain a singl approv from epa it also would not requir the owner or oper of such a unit to obtain multipl approv from each state in which the dispos technolog will be use the owner or oper of a mobil or multipl but ident stationari unit may want to obtain a tsca coordin approv to ensur the feder and state requir are harmon a state may chose to permit mobil technolog that will be use exclus in that state and epa would respect it author to do so howev an approv that has been obtain from one state may not be accept to epa in develop a tsca coordin approv that is intend for use in multipl state although the process for implement a tsca pcb coordin approv mechan was not discuss in the anprm epa consid establish a self implement or an interact coordin approv process the two approach are discuss below a interact approach epa propos at 761 77 to recogn permit issu under other feder law administ by epa and state pcb dispos author use an interact tsca pcb coordin approv mechan epa believ the interact approach describ below would provid the agenc the best opportun to effect overse pcb activ that are conduct under anoth statutori author in addit the interact coordin approv would maxim the region administr abil to serv in a prevent rather than a reactiv role in those instanc where unintent neglig by the regul communiti could result in risk of injuri to health and the environ from exposur to pcbs at 761 77 epa is propos to includ as a condit of the tsca pcb coordin approv all requir condit and limit of a non tsca permit or other wast manag document issu by a state or under anoth statut administ by epa prior to the effect date of this rule the provis allow for both simultan coordin under the tsca pcb permit author and the other state or feder permit author when a wast

after the region administr receiv and review a request for a tsca pcb coordin approv that includ a copi of the non tsca approv and a verif that the facil had submit epa form 7710 53 and receiv an epa

howev a facil could not commenc oper until it receiv a tsca pcb approv if it receiv a notic of defici from the region the deadlin for submit the permit applic and the region administr rational for requir a tsca approv would be reflect in the region administr written notic of defici b self implement approach this approach would allow the owner or oper of a facil with a feder environment wast

have been complet or the facil is not in complianc with the condit of the rod in the event the region requir the owner or oper of the facil to obtain a tsca approv the region administr would establish a deadlin for the owner or oper of the facil to submit an applic general not less than 30 day from receipt of the notic of defici for a tsca pcb approv howev the owner or oper of the facil would be abl to continu oper under the provis of the tsca pcb coordin approv until the tsca approv is issu except in the instanc where a notic of defici was issu then a tsca pcb approv would first be requir after issuanc of the tsca approv epa would no longer recogn the state or other feder permit for that facil as be the equival of a tsca pcb approv the primari respons for complianc monitor and enforc

applic for financi assist to support current state activ to establish a pcb dispos program fund under this program was not anticip to continu beyond fiscal year 1992 under the state grant propos epa would partial fund effort by the state to establish a state pcb dispos program through the develop of state legisl and regul of pcb dispos activ state were also requir to provid a match of 25 percent of the total cost of the project sever comment were not in favor of epa encourag of the list of pcbs under state hazard wast program addit some comment voic concern that epa was tri to deleg it respons to the state to enforc feder requir and final comment were also skeptic of whether there would be adequ fund under the grant to implement state dispos program tsca grant were to be use as seed money to complement ongo state pcb dispos activ in creat the tsca section 28 grant provis the intent of congress was to provid financi assist to select state to complement and augment epa effort author under the act ref 55 it had envis that those state most heavili impact by chemic pollut problem upon applic and approv by epa would receiv assist from epa to be elig for a grant state would have to be engag in the process of list pcbs under it hazard wast law or in adopt tsca look alik law for the storag and or dispos of pcbs the process for establish a pcb dispos program would have to have been complet by septemb 30 1992 sinc the respons to the feder regist notic solicit applic for assist was limit the program has been discontinu l clarif of the requir to request approv for altern method of dispos section 761 60 e of the pcb regul state that person who are requir to inciner pcbs and pcb item and who can demonstr that an altern method exist for destroy these pcbs or pcb item and that this altern method can achiev a level of perform equival to 761 70 inciner may submit a written request to the epa for an exempt from the inciner requir of 761 70 or 761 60 it was never the agenc intent that the submiss of an applic for an altern dispos method in lieu of inciner be option as could be constru by the use of the word may in 761 60 e epa therefor propos to amend 761 60 e to clarifi that written approv to use an altern method of destroy pcbs or pcb item must be obtain from the appropri epa offici prior to ani use of the method to destroy pcb wast m wet weight dri weight clarif this rule propos to clarifi the basi on which pcb concentr are to be determin for the purpos of identifi applic requir under the pcb rule propos 761 1 b of this rule would requir that pcb concentr for non liquid materi which contain no liquid which pass through the filter when use the paint filter test method epa method 9095 in test method for evalu solid wast sw 846 be determin on a dri weight basi accord to the definit propos at 761 3 the propos rule would requir the pcb concentr to be determin on a wet weight basi for liquid pcbs as propos to be defin at 761 3 ie homogen flowabl materi contain pcbs and no more than 05 percent non dissolv materi this rule would also establish requir for determin pcb concentr in situat where separ distinct phase were present within sampl of materi contain pcbs on april 6 1990 55 fr 12866 epa publish a propos rule that sought to clarifi how to determin the pcb concentr in media where water is present howev sever comment on the april 6 1990 propos rule indic that it could be read to requir determin of pcb concentr of all sampl includ liquid sampl by remov dri evapor or condens the liquid and thus leav onli pcbs this notic respond to those comment by clarifi the april 6 1990 propos and propos distinct requir for determin the pcb concentr in liquid non liquid and multiphas liquid liquid and liquid non liquid sampl the april 6 1990 notic propos that pcb concentr be determin on a dri weight basi for all substanc non liquid or liquid regul under part 761 includ but not limit to dielectr fluid contamin solvent oil wast oil heat transfer fluid hydraul fluid paint sludg slurri dredg spoil soil materi contamin as the result of spill and other chemic substanc or combin of substanc includ impur and byproduct and ani byproduct intermedi or impur manufactur at ani point in a process epa assum that most substanc or mixtur from which sampl will be taken for the determin of pcb concentr by chemic analysi will fall into the categori list abov with the addit of wastewat water may be present in some of these substanc or mixtur in vari amount and for various reason the pcb current regul do not requir a specif chemic analyt method for the determin of pcb concentr mani chemic analysi procedur use to determin pcb concentr requir account for the presenc of water in sampl in a way that accomplish epa object in this rule howev there are some chemic analysi procedur that could be use for pcbs but that were develop to address more general object therefor these more general chemic analysi procedur may either offer sever option for account for water in sampl or requir a differ way to account for water than would be appropri for determin the pcb concentr to meet the requir and intent of the pcb regul the overal purpos of the propos revis to 761 1 b is to ensur a consist and reproduc basi for determin the concentr of pcbs in the pcb contain medium such a basi would enabl the agenc to appli the pcb rule in a consist manner to determin the pcb concentr of a nonliquid as will be discuss below the medium of concern is the non liquid materi becaus it is the most like repositori of the pcbs therefor ani water in the sampl should be account for in the determin of the pcb concentr of the sampl becaus the amount of water can signific bias the pcb concentr in the sampl for liquid sampl howev the medium of concern is the liquid itself therefor to determin the pcb concentr in that medium one may determin the pcb concentr on a wet weight basi for exampl for water sampl the medium of concern is the water and it would not make sens to exclud the water 1 liquid pcbs includ organ liquid and wastewat liquid pcbs would be defin in 761 3 as homogen flowabl materi contain pcbs and no more than 05 percent by weight non dissolv materi the propos revis to 761 1 b would requir concentr for liquid pcbs to be determin on a wet weight basi wet weight basi mean report chemic analysi result by includ the weight of all dissolv water in a homogen liquid if the liquid is homogen the pcbs will be distribut throughout the medium even for nonhomogen liquid sampl howev pcbs are more like to be more concentr in one compon of the sampl than they are in other becaus of the physic and chemic properti pcbs possess eg pcbs are hydrophob thus for these sampl the propos would requir each phase of a non homogen liquid to be separ analyz on a wet weight basi epa recogn howev that even if each phase of a liquid sampl is separ analyz some small amount of water that are not separ may be found in a particular phase ie some small amount of water may be found in oil for liquid sampl contain water the separ water must be remov and each phase of the sampl must be separ analyz on a wet weight basi separ water is water that may be readili physic separ eg by the use of a separatori funnel filtrat or by decant epa note that most organ liquid in which pcbs are found includ miner oil dielectr fluid heat transfer fluid oil base hydraul fluid and rins solvent usual do not contain more than 1 or 2 percent of non separ water this non separ water usual is in a suspens or in solut sinc the amount of non separ water is usual veri low compar to the amount of organ liquid the effect of non separ water on the concentr of pcbs in these organ liquid is relat small thus epa believ that allow the non separ water to be includ in the analysi would general not affect the regulatori status of a sampl when there is non separ water in an organ liquid chemic analyst will normal use a desicc to remov even this small amount of non separ water from the liquid dure chemic analysi these small amount of non separ water are remov to avoid potenti interfer to pcb instrument respons from water and potenti damag to the chemic instrument even though the small amount of non separ water remov by desicc could be account for they normal are not account for becaus this non separ water has limit influenc on the pcb concentr of the organ liquid also epa note that wastewat sampl consist almost entir of non separ water for wastewat sampl the analyst will normal use an organ solvent to extract the pcbs from the wastewat even though the pcbs are remov from the water dure the determin of the pcb concentr chemic analyst do not consid this determin to be on a dri weight basi sinc wastewat may contain signific amount of suspend materi this rule propos to identifi how much suspend materi may be present in the water to still be consid a homogen liquid for the purpos of determin pcbs in water if wastewat contain greater than 05 percent non dissolv non liquid the wastewat would be consid to be multiphas liquid non liquid if wastewat contain other immisc liquid separ by decant the pcb concentr for those other liquid would be consid to be multiphas liquid liquid 2 non liquid pcbs non liquid pcbs are propos to be defin at 761 3 as pcbs which contain no liquid which pass through the filter when use the paint filter liquid test method epa method 9095 in test method for evalu solid wast sw 846 propos 761 1 b would requir pcb concentr for non liquid pcbs to be defin on a dri weight basi dri weight basi would be determin as report chemic analysi result by exclud the weight of the water from the weight of the sampl in addit for purpos of this propos ani chemic analysi process which remov and or account for the amount of water present in non liquid compli with the requir to determin the pcb concentr in non liquid on a dri weight basi these process includ some or all of the follow filtrat decant and heat at low temperatur follow by cool in the presenc of a desicc the determin of the pcb concentr in the non liquid would be base on the weight of pcbs in the weight of the result dri non liquid water separ from non liquid through filtrat or decant would be treat as a liquid sampl as describ in unit iii 1 liquid includ organ liquid and wastewat abov soil sediment and sludg are exampl of pcb contain media that can contain vari amount of water and still pass the paint filter liquid test for non liquid in addit there are ani number of other pcb contain media such as paper wet automobil shredder fluff and other fiber product that can also contain vari amount of water and pass the paint filter liquid test for non liquid as well these non liquid pcbs may contain a relat larg amount of non separ water compar to the amount of non separ water that can be contain in the organ liquid normal encount in pcb sampl for the purpos of determin pcb concentr of soil sediment and sludg on a dri weight basi the amount of water not separ from these non liquid sampl by filtrat or decant would have to be account for in report the pcb concentr 3 mixtur of liquid and or non liquid in multiphas sampl that is sampl contain a both non liquid and liquid or b more than one liquid phase chemic analyst usual separ non liquid from liquid and immisc liquid from each other befor chemic analysi this separ elimin the potenti consist and reproduc problem and also provid meaning comparison of pcb concentr for regulatori purpos the separ techniqu employ in the laboratori to separ non liquid from liquid must result in equival to the paint filter liquid test in order to assum a complet separ of liquid and non liquid materi in a sampl contain more than one phase where the phase are capabl of be separ from each other by procedur such as decant and filtrat the propos rule would requir the phase to be separ from each other prior to chemic analysi and the pcb concentr for each separ phase of the mixtur sampl to be determin individu separ non liquid would be requir to be analyz on a dri weight basi and liquid would be requir to be analyz on a wet weight basi n oil fill equip manufactur after the ban in the applic section of part 761 at 761 1 epa is propos to add paragraph g to provid clarif with regard to the classif of oil fill equip manufactur after the ban on the manufactur of pcbs took effect on juli 2 1979 the purpos of this clarif is to recogn that oil fill equip manufactur after the ban accompani either by document provid by the manufactur or a label or mark affix by the manufactur certifi base on test data that the equip doe not contain pcbs doe not fall into the assumpt categori under the definit of pcb contamin electr equip at current 761 3 that all oil fill equip where pcb concentr is unknown must be assum to be greater than 50 ppm pcbs for purpos of this propos rulemak the criteria for demonstr that the transform contain no pcbs are the equip must have been origin manufactur with no pcbs after the effect date of the ban juli 2 1979 and must not have been servic with ani pcbs at unit iii c of this preambl epa is propos to amend the definit of pcb contamin electr equip to indic that the refer to oil fill mean miner oil and that not all equip that contain an oili substanc can be assum to be pcb contamin similar propos 761 1 g would clarifi that oil fill miner or otherwis equip that was manufactur after the ban on the manufactur of pcbs that was certifi to contain no pcbs at the time of manufactur and has not been subsequ servic with fluid contain pcbs should not and will not be assum to be pcb contamin in fact this equip is not subject to the provis of 40 cfr part 761 o pcb voltag regul the current regul at 761 30 a 1 xv requir owner of miner oil transform that the owner had assum to contain 50 to 499 ppm pcbs that are test and found to contain 500 ppm or greater pcbs to bring those unit into complianc with all the applic provis of part 761 epa is propos at 761 30 a 1 xvi the same requir for voltag regul accord voltag regul assum to be pcb contamin that are later test and found to contain 500 ppm pcb or greater would be requir to come into complianc with part 761 voltag regul which were mark or otherwis known to contain pcbs at greater than 500 ppm would also be requir to come into complianc with all the applic requir of part 761 section 761 30 h would also be revis to reflect this chang in mani respect voltag regul are design to function in a manner similar to transform they consum a small amount of current and adjust their output voltag with precis limit base on voltag and current need of the power system though the actual size and fluid requir of voltag regul vari depend upon precis voltag rate age and manufactur voltag regul of less than 100 kva contain approxim 30 gallon of fluid and those over 100 kva approxim 200 gallon voltag regul were manufactur with miner oil fluid of which 14 percent contain pcbs greater than or equal to 50 ppm and less than 2 percent contain greater than or equal to 500 ppm pcbs base on this data epa doe not expect mani voltag regul to be abov the 500 ppm pcb level howev as with miner oil transform later test and found to contain abov 500 ppm pcb those that were found to be 500 ppm or greater would be treat in the same manner as transform at 500 ppm or greater the impetus for this propos is to ensur that voltag regul that are found to contain 500 ppm or greater pcbs are proper mark while in servic their locat are mark record are kept pursuant to 761 180 they are regist with fire depart and they are proper dispos of when they are taken out of servic as well as solicit comment on this propos chang in general epa is solicit comment on the appropri of requir enhanc electr protect for voltag regul as is the case for miner oil transform later found to contain greater than or equal to 500 ppm pcbs in addit epa is solicit comment on whether it is suffici to simpli add voltag regul to exist 761 30 a 1 xv renumb in this propos rule as 761 30 a 1 xvi or whether a separ subparagraph should be ad to address this issu becaus voltag regul contain greater than or equal to 500 ppm pcb should not be treat in the same manner as pcb transform if there are compel reason to treat these voltag regul differ due for exampl to their size locat or use epa welcom suggest on the most appropri way to regul these piec of pcb electr equip p registr requir for pcb transform contain 500 ppm pcbs pursuant to section 18 b of tsca the state of connecticut petit epa for an exempt from the preemption provis of section 18 a 2 to allow the state to requir among other thing the registr of pcb transform ie transform with dielectr fluid at 500 ppm pcb with the connecticut depart of environment protect connecticut argu that this notif would provid a signific higher degre of protect for state resid and emerg respons personnel from the risk pose by pcb transform than the current feder rule under tsca becaus 1 state emerg respons personnel often respond to fire and spill at site throughout the state and 2 state administr action such as issu warn regard fish swim or other activ that could increas human exposur to pcbs when fire or spill occur could be made in a more time manner while epa see merit in these argument epa believ that resid of everi state would be better protect by a uniform nationwid registr requir where epa would receiv the data and make it avail to feder and state emerg respons personnel today rule propos a new 761 30 a

transform within 30 day of the transfer the regul at 761 30 a 1 vi and vii current includ requir for regist all pcb transform with fire respons personnel and owner of ani nearbi commerci build state and local author may also have notif requir for emerg respons personnel owner of transform at industri site could fulfil the current requir by regist with their on site fire brigad while owner of pcb transform in or near commerci build had to regist with the local fire depart subsequ review of the regul communiti complianc with these registr requir by the offic of the inspector general of epa and epa region personnel found that mani fire depart includ those serv larg citi had not receiv registr inform for a larg percentag of those pcb transform which should have been regist in addit mani owner could not demonstr that they had regist their transform as requir to continu each unit author for use therefor the registr requir propos today would extend to all pcb transform in use or in storag for reus even if a specif pcb transform was regist under the current requir at 761 30 a 1 under propos 761 30 a 1 vii c this requir would be a part of the author for continu use for each pcb transform epa solicit comment on this propos and the petit from the state of connecticut if epa doe not promulg today propos uniform nation registr requir then it would be inclin to promulg an exempt under section 18 b to allow ani state to implement it own registr requir for transform q rectifi it has come to epa attent that a certain number of oil fill and solid state rectifi devic that convert ac current to dc current contain pcbs while rectifi are not specif author for use in the pcb regul it is epa intent to author at propos 761 30 r the continu use of rectifi in a similar manner as transform to be consist with epa use author for non total enclos electr equip to add specif to this propos author for rectifi epa is solicit comment and data on the follow 1 the number of rectifi current in use 2 the extent of pcb contamin in rectifi 3 the size of such unit and whether epa should adopt a de minimi volum amount as is the case with capacitor ie capacitor with less than 3 pound of fluid are consid small and general not regul under tsca for dispos at which rectifi would be regul under tsca 4 the number of oil fill vs solid state rectifi and 5 ani inform that will assist epa in support a use author for this type of equip propos 761 30 r would author pcbs at ani concentr to be use in rectifi and pcbs at less than 50 ppm to be use in servic rectifi for the remaind of their use life r use of pcbs in scientif equip it has come to epa attent that certain type of scientif equip have histor use pcbs as a medium for compar measur specif epa has been made awar of the histor use of pcbs in studi of birefring and viscoelast of long chain polym ref 58 the pcbs serv as a high viscos medium to uniform reduc all movement to facilit comparison of long chain polym these studi date back to well befor the enact of tsca and have includ hundr of thousand of compar refer data run other media could be use to replac pcbs in these instrument but none yield result compar to the larg histor refer data set use pcbs as refer standard while pcbs are not specif author for special use in scientif equip it is epa intent to author at propos 761 30 s their continu use in situat where the pcbs were in use as of the date of public of today propos addit inform is request as to whi substitut are not avail or otherwis could not be use and whi the continu use of pcbs present no unreason risk to health and the

or applic of pcbs the dispos of the pcbs and ani contamin equip is fulli regul under tsca s remov outdat materi in respons to a request to remov outdat materi from the code of feder regul epa is propos to remov the provis at 761 20 c 3 that requir the submiss to epa of a notic at least 30 day prior to the export for dispos of pcbs or pcb item the regul had author export for dispos until may 1 1980 in delet the notif requir epa propos to retain the prohibit against export pcbs for dispos after may 1 1980 as reflect at 761 20 c 3 in today notic likewis sever use author specifi deadlin by which certain activ were to ceas section 761 30 a 1 iii which prohibit the instal of pcb transform in or near commerci build after octob 1 1985 contain provis for the continu instal of such transform in emerg situat or for reclassif up until octob 1 1990 sinc these provis are now obsolet epa is propos their remov with the except of the provis to allow the indefinit instal of miner oil pcb transform which is still valid and would be retain therefor 761 30 a 1 iii a through d would be delet with the except of the requir of 761 30 a 1 iii c 2 ii and c 2 iii which would be retain and

servic of railroad transform contain procedur for phase in a reduct of the pcb concentr for dielectr fluid use in railroad transform essenti the use of greater than 1 000 ppm pcbs in these transform was prohibit after juli 1 1986 therefor epa is propos to amend paragraph b 1 by delet paragraph b 1 i through b 1 vii at 761 30 b 1 use restrict paragraph b 1 would be amend to restrict the use of pcbs in the dielectr fluid of railroad transform to 1 000 ppm after juli 1 1986 as is current requir by 761 30 b 1 vi further epa is propos to delet 761 30 b 2 ii servic restrict and to redesign 761 30 b 2 iii through vii as b 2 ii through vi the provis at 761 30 c use in and servic of mine equip would be revis to delet the condit list at paragraph c 1 through c 5 sinc the timefram of the author for the use and servic of mine equip contain pcbs has laps and these condit are no longer relev the introductori paragraph for 761 30 c would also be amend to delet the process and distribut in commerc servic author for pcbs greater than 50 ppm use in mine equip which expir on januari 1 1982 the author would be revis to allow servic onli with pcbs at a concentr level of less than 50 ppm section 761 30 d 1 through d 5 set condit on the use of pcbs at concentr of 50 ppm or greater prior to juli 1 1984 the recordkeep requir under paragraph d 5 expir on juli 1 1989 5 year after the

rule or by other wast handl associ other item which are be propos in today notic have been previous promulg under rcra regul and seem appropri for inclus in the pcb n m rule some of the issu below are simpli clarif and are not intend to result in chang to the codifi section of 40 cfr part 761 epa is solicit comment on the follow propos amend and clarif to the pcb n m rule a small quantiti exempt for solid on june 27 1990 55 fr 26204 epa issu a correct to the n m rule that among other thing sought to clarifi the definit of commerci storer of pcb wast at 761 3 the word liquid was ad to the phrase exceed 500 gallon of pcbs so that the phrase now read exceed 500 liquid gallon of pcbs this exclud facil that were store at ani one time less than 500 gallon of liquid pcb wast from the need to seek approv as a commerci storer of that wast in a petit for review of the n m rule file with the district of columbia circuit court of appeal on septemb 25 1990 the petition claim that epa act arbitrarili when it narrow the small volum exempt in the definit of commerci storer so that onli storer of liquid pcb wast at amount of less than 500 gallon would qualifi epa agre that there were certain class of busi eg compani perform pcb wast treatabl studi and laboratori affili with pcb handl compani that on occas may possess relat small quantiti of solid pcb wast generat by other under the current rule these compani do not qualifi for the exempt for small quantiti liquid and therefor must appli for approv as commerci storer of pcb wast epa agre there may be reason for establish a small quantiti exempt for solid to complement the rule small quantiti exempt for liquid epa also indic to the petition that until a formal amend to the rule was promulg no enforc action would be taken against a facil store small quantiti of pcb solid without a commerci storag approv if the follow requir were met 1 time notif to epa of it pcb wast activ 2 storag at no time of more than 70 cubic feet of pcb solid wast the approxim volumetr equival of 500 gallon 3 complianc with all other applic requir as set forth in tsca or the pcb rule this propos rule would add a small volum exempt for storag of no more than 70 cubic feet of non liquid pcbs to the definit of commerci storer of pcb wast at 761 3 epa is solicit comment on the appropri of this small volum exempt for solid and in particular whether 70 cubic feet is an appropri cutoff also in the propos amend to the definit of commerci storer at 761 3 epa is clarifi a point on the chang of ownership or releas of titl of pcb wast and how that relat to a person becom or not becom a commerci storer of pcb wast the follow exampl illustr the propos clarif if a facil that generat and store it own wast eg transform is sold or the titl otherwis chang ownership the new owner or holder of the titl doe not becom a commerci storer of pcb wast becaus the owner is now a storer of wast generat by someon els the wast along with the facil is now own by the purchas and the purchas is store it own wast therefor the purchas is not a commerci storer b clarif of except report epa is propos to amend 761 215 b c and d which discuss the time when a generat commerci storer or dispos must submit one year except report to the epa region administr current a dispos is requir to submit a one year except report whenev both of the follow occur 1 the pcb wast is receiv on a date more than 9 month from the date the pcb wast was remov from servic for dispos as indic on the manifest 2 the dispos could not dispos of the pcb wast within 1 year from the date of remov from servic for dispos a generat is requir to submit the except report when a copi of the manifest with the hand written signatur of the owner or oper of the design facil has not been receiv within 45 day of the date the wast was accept by the origin transport also a generat or commerci storer who manifest pcbs or pcb item to a dispos of pcb wast must submit the except report when both of the follow occur 1 the wast was transfer to the dispos within 9 month of the date of remov from servic for dispos as indic on the manifest 2 the generat or commerci storer has not receiv within 13 month from the date of remov for dispos a certif of dispos cd or they receiv the cd and it indic that the wast was dispos of on a date more than 1 year after the date of remov from servic for dispos these section of the regul do not howev indic when the dispos commerci storer or generat has to submit the one year except report to the region administr epa is propos to amend 761 215 b c and d to requir that the dispos commerci storer or generat submit the one year except report to the region administr no later than 30 day from the discoveri of the passag of the regulatori deadlin epa solicit comment on the appropri of the propos 30 day period c time for submiss of the certif of dispos section 761 218 b requir that a certif of dispos cd be sent to the generat indic on the manifest that accompani the shipment of pcb wast to the dispos facil within 30 day of the date that dispos of the pcb wast identifi on the manifest was complet section 761 215 d 2 indic that one of the occas when a generat or commerci storer should submit a one year except report to the region administr is when the cd is not receiv from the dispos within 13 month from the date of remov from servic for dispos dorfsfd epa wish to clarifi that there may be differ dorfsfd date for differ individu item on ani given manifest this mean that some item list on the manifest will need to be dispos of earlier than other to meet the 1 year time limit for storag and dispos due to the fact that there may be differ dispos date for differ item on the same manifest there will also be differ cds associ with those differ dispos date unless of cours the entir shipment list on the manifest is dispos of befor the 1 year anniversari of the item with the earliest dorfsfd the generat may either submit more than one manifest per shipment base on whether or not there are differ dorfsfd for the item in the shipment or attach a continu sheet to reflect the differ dorfsfd this may be time consum initi but will ensur that the generat receiv a proper cd that identifi the specif pcb item note the generat identifi number if assign to close the dispos loop on the generat wast epa want to make clear that it is not appropri to base the dispos of the item on the manifest with the latest dorfsfd or correspond to send the cd base on that item d no manifest for pre 1978 50 ppm spill epa propos to amend 761 207 j this section describ what wast base on pcb concentr and factor in whether or not dilut has occur are subject to the manifest requir the section now state that if the wast contain less than 50 ppm pcbs but come from a sourc that contain greater than 50 ppm pcbs the wast is subject to the manifest and dispos requir cite as an exampl is pcb spill cleanup materi contain less than 50 ppm when the spill involv materi contain greater than 50 ppm the propos amend at 761 207 j would specifi that there is no manifest requir for materi current below 50 ppm that deriv from pre april 18 1978 spill of ani concentr or pre juli 2 1979 spill less than 500 ppm this is becaus 1 the materi as found is below the regulatori threshold that would make it subject to the dispos requir of subpart d and 2 the origin spill materi was either below or not subject to the dispos requir of part 761 subpart d at the time of the origin spill in addit the manifest requir doe not appli to materi deriv from spill that have been decontamin in accord with epa spill cleanup polici in other word materi contain pcbs that has been decontamin to the polici standard to a level below 50 ppm would not be treat as if it contain greater than 50 ppm pcbs for dispos purpos and could be dispos of in a municip landfil or by other non pcb dispos method this posit is consist with epa regul that permit materi that has been contamin as the result of a spill of pcbs to be distribut in commerc if the materi is decontamin in accord with the applic spill cleanup polici see 40 cfr 761 20 c 5 epa is solicit comment on the propos amend to 761 207 j to make it clear as to when one doe or doe not have to manifest pcb wast materi that is less than 50 ppm e notif by transport it has come to the agenc attent that there is some confus in the regul communiti as to whether a subcontractor or a perman leas oper can use the epa identif number epa id number issu to an unrel compani that has notifi as a transport sinc ani person engag in the transport of regul pcb wast must under current 761 205 appli for and receiv an epa id number a perman leas oper or a subcontractor must notifi separ and receiv a separ and distinct epa id number to transport pcb wast the intent of the pcb n m rule would be subvert if this were not the case the agenc would have no record of who was do the actual physic transport of pcb wast theoret a compani could appli for a master id number that could be use by hundr of perman leas oper or subcontractor this would be clear contrari to the intent of the n m rule which is to have a record of each pcb wast handler the regul at 761 3 defin a transport of pcb wast as ani person engag in the transport of regul pcb wast and 761 205 requir that all transport notifi epa of their pcb wast handl activ f renotif for chang in facil oper section 761 202 and 761 205 discuss who must obtain an epa id number and how to obtain such an id number through the use of epa form 7710 53 epa wish to clarifi that when a facil has previous notifi the agenc of it pcb wast handl activ use epa form 7710 53 and those activ chang eg the owner or oper of the facil notifi epa as a commerci storer and now want to engag in the transport of pcb wast or notifi as a transport and a commerci storer but no longer wish to engag in the activ of transport pcb wast the notifi must resubmit epa form 7710 3 to reflect those chang other exampl of when a pcb wast handler must renotifi the agenc includ but are not limit to when the compani stop handl pcb wast or chang the facil locat indic in a cover letter or on the form itself that this is a resubmiss base on chang in facil oper and not a new submiss will help to facilit the process epa is propos to add this requir for resubmiss of epa form 7710 53 when there is a chang in a facil status to new 761 205 f epa is propos that the resubmiss be submit to epa no later than 5 work day after the chang was made g transfer of ownership of commerci storag facil epa is propos to amend 761 65 by ad a new paragraph j to includ languag on the procedur and time associ with the transfer of ownership of a commerci storag facil the time and procedur would appli to facil with either interim or final approv exist commerci storag facil had until august 2 1990 to submit a complet applic to epa and receiv interim status to oper until the applic was formal approv or deni section 761 65 d 3 describ the inform that must be includ in the applic such as a closur plan closur cost estim and financi assur for closur the n m rule did not howev discuss procedur and criteria for transfer ownership of a facil with interim status or final approv to oper as is the case under the regul implement rcra at 40 cfr 270 72 a 4 the agenc is solicit comment on the follow propos procedur as a way to address the issu of transfer of ownership of commerci storag facil the agenc would recogn the transfer of interim status or final approv for commerci storag facil if all the follow condit were met 1 the transfere demonstr it had establish by the date of transfer financi assur for closur pursuant to 761 65 g use a mechan effect as of the date of final approv this would assur that there would be

identifi in the applic of the transferor were resolv in the new applic by either the transferor or by the transfere the new applic would also have to includ all the element list in 40 cfr 761 65 d 3 includ but not limit to a demonstr that the applic and it princip and key employe were qualifi to engag in the busi of commerci storag of pcb wast the facil had the capac to handl the pcb wast estim by the applic certif of complianc with the storag facil standard at 761 65 b and or c 7 a written closur plan demonstr of financi respons for closur demonstr that oper of the facil would not present an unreason risk of injuri to health or the environ and the environment complianc histori of the applic and it princip and key employe befor the transfer of interim status or final approv could occur epa would have to review the new applic and deem it complet ie all the requir element were includ in the applic the applic would also have to correct ani signific defici previous identifi of cours epa would reserv the right to deni the transfer of the interim approv status or final approv if upon interim review of the new applic epa determin that the transfere was not qualifi or was unabl or unwil to achiev and maintain it oper in complianc with tsca and the pcb rule in addit a determin by the epa region administr that the transfer of interim status or final approv could occur would not be determin of the final decis that would be made regard the commerci storag applic epa would also reserv the right to deni ani subsequ transfer request respect a particular facil if epa believ that such a transfer was undertaken to avoid the requir of seek a final commerci storag approv the requir propos abov would have to be met befor epa would recogn the transfer of interim status for exampl compani x is interest in acquir ownership of compani y which has interim status to oper as a commerci storer of pcb wast if epa doe not recogn the transfer of interim status befor compani x take legal titl of ownership of the facil from compani y compani x may be in violat of the commerci storag regul becaus it did not have interim status to oper at the time it took legal titl to facilit the transfer of ownership the agenc also solicit comment on whether a new applic is entir necessari if for exampl the transfere accept the content of the old applic the onli part of the applic that would have to be amend exclud ani defici that have yet to be correct would be the financi assur for closur a new list of principl and key employe and the complianc histori of ani busi with which those

section 761 65 e 4 discuss when a commerci storag facil must submit a request to epa for a modif to it storag approv to amend it closur plan the agenc is propos a similar requir for revis the financi assur for closur when there are modif to the commerci storag facil for exampl where the facil is enlarg and the maximum inventori of wast increas suffici to warrant an increas to the financi assur mechan epa is propos to add 761 65 g 9 to indic that when a modif to the storag facil occur that warrant establish a new financi assur mechan or amend the exist financi assur mechan the owner or oper shall have establish and activ the new financi assur mechan no later than 30 day after the region administr or director cmd is notifi of the complet of the modif of the facil but prior to the use of the modifi portion of the facil in addit the region administr or director cmd would have to be notifi in write no later than 7 day of complet of the modif to the facil epa is also solicit comment on the appropri of ad those requir to the exist languag at 761 65 f 3 sinc this section also address modif in this case closur rather than ad a new paragraph g 9 to 761 65 i clarif of which dispos must

propos to amend 761 3 to add the definit of treatabl studi that would essenti mirror the exist definit under rcra at 40 cfr 260 10 treatment is a form of dispos under the pcb rule l clarif of the term facil in today propos rule the agenc is solicit comment on the need to clarifi the term facil and facil the term is use in differ context throughout the regulatori text of 40 cfr part 761 the impetus for the agenc rais this need for a clarif of the term aros after review a section of preambl languag in the pcb notif and manifest rule 54 fr 52716 in the preambl on page 52722 column 2 the discuss focuss on the requir for generat with on site storag facil to notifi the agenc of their pcb wast handl activ the first two sentenc in the last paragraph read in submit their notif to epa member of this class of generat storer will submit a notif form for each of their storag area that is subject to 761 65 epa will issu a uniqu identif number to each notifi storag facil and this identif number will correspond to the physic locat of the facil here the term storag area and storag facil are use interchang in the first case to mean a particular build structur cell or unit and in the second instanc all structur on contigu land or specifi piec of properti as a matter of record it was not the agenc intent to requir notif for each storag unit on the contigu piec of properti which would result in multipl individu identif number for that properti the facil regardless of the number of storag area or unit on the piec of properti need onli notifi onc for that contigu piec of properti therefor in this instanc the term facil mean all contigu land and structur use for the storag of pcb wast there are howev other section of the pcb regul where the term facil mean an individu unit or structur most notabl at 761 65 b 1 here the regul state that a facil use for the storag of pcbs and pcb item shall have an adequ roof wall and floor continu curb with a minimum 6 inch high curb no floor drain or expans joint etc and shall not be locat at a site below the 100 year flood water elev it is clear in this instanc that the agenc is not refer to a contigu piec of properti but to an individu structur or unit in the vast major of case in 40 cfr part 761 the term facil refer to the contigu piec of properti includ the structur or individu storag or dispos unit on that properti there are howev 10 or so citat in the pcb regul where the term facil refer onli to the individu unit or structur it is these 10 place in the regul where epa is propos to delet the term facil and insert a term whose definit will best repres the agenc intent ie an individu unit structur or build the agenc solicit comment on the most appropri term to convey this mean for purpos of this propos rule the term unit will be use to indic this chang in the propos regulatori text in addit the agenc welcom comment if it has inadvert omit a section or section of the regul where the term facil should be delet

impact whenev there is a signific econom impact on a substanti number of small entiti while this discuss will consid the signific of the potenti impact epa intern polici is to consid ani impact on ani small entiti us epa 1992d accord to epa guidelin signific impact are produc if annual complianc cost increas the cost of product by more than 5 percent cost of complianc as a percentag of sale are at least 10 percent higher than for larg entiti capit cost repres a signific percentag of the total capit avail and the regul is like to shut down small entiti a econom impact on small industri furnac oper the small industri furnac oper handl pcb contamin transform would experi negat econom impact as a result of the propos amend it was estim that approxim 100 industri furnac oper special in recoveri of transform carcass most of the busi are small rang from owner oper unit with fewer than 10 employe to larger oper approach 100 employe the major asset for these facil is their furnac which in the case of aljon unit furnac carri a capit cost of over 100 000 through contact with a select of oper their like respons to the pcb amend was estim in general firm would not be like to invest in the new furnac equip that would meet epa specif the new equip is quit cost and the high temperatur requir would make recoveri of the metal imposs it was estim that on averag these oper deriv approxim 15 percent of their input from pcb contamin transform base on sever contact with industri personnel the remaind of their input are non pcb contamin transform and other electr equip there are no financi statist avail through convent or other sourc of industri data that can provid an overview of the condit of the metal recoveri furnac industri given these characterist of the affect industri furnac oper the epa criteria to determin whether the econom impact are signific were appli none of the first three criteria shown could be evalu howev becaus they all are defin by the size of the complianc cost incur the industri furnac oper would not incur direct complianc cost choos instead to ceas handl of the pcb contamin transform the last criterion ask whether the small firm will ceas oper base on discuss with industri firm it was estim that few oper would shut down as note the affect pcb transform repres approxim 15 percent of the input for metal recoveri oper a correspond 15 percent declin in profit while repres a hardship should not caus mani plant shutdown most like there would not be mani firm whose input owe to a peculiar in their sourc of suppli contain a much higher portion of pcb contamin transform than other firm nevertheless some firm might experi sharper profit declin also firm that are current in poor financi condit could be weaken further as a result of the

light ballast as municip solid wast most wast light ballast are generat dure build demolit oper mani demolit contractor that handl the dispos of light ballast and their custom would incur increas dispos cost due to these regul at present most pcb light ballast are dispos of as municip solid wast demolit contractor howev would be requir to assembl and transport pcb contain light ballast for transport to and dispos at a pcb dispos facil the aggreg econom impact was estim for this provis of the regul at 54 million for dispos of approxim 30 million pcb contain light ballast this translat to an averag increment cost of approxim 80 per pcb contain light ballast cover transport and dispos as deriv in the specif cost estim for this provis the size of the increment cost incur on a specif demolit job would vari direct with the size of the job thus relat small demolit job those generat onli slight more than 24 pcb contain light ballast for exampl those with 25 to 50 ballast would incur increment dispos cost of 45 to 90 25 to 50 time 80 in contrast larg demolit job with thousand of light ballast would incur addit dispos cost of sever thousand of dollar thus the increment cost are distribut among demolit job accord to their size and the increment cost would not be like to be a larg percentag increas in the cost of demolit job demolit contractor do not vari much in their abil to handl and dispos of pcb contain light ballast so there would not be much variat in the unit cost of complianc among firm for exampl virtual all demolit firm would use commerci wast facil to dispos of light ballast this consist of impact among firm suggest that firm would not be abl to compet on their abil to dispos of pcb wast and therefor would all face similar cost increas in competit market where all firm face similar cost increas the price of servic should increas to cover the increas in cost thus demolit contractor would be like to pass the increment dispos cost to their custom new build or land develop compani and therefor would be abl to mitig even minor cost impact the epa criteria on small busi impact were appli to the case of demolit contractor none of the four criteria are satisfi howev by the regulatori impact complianc cost are estim to be less than 5 percent of the cost of product and less than 10 percent of the cost of sale in all but veri except circumst essenti no capit cost expenditur would be requir of the affect firm final few oper if ani would like fail due to these regulatori impact c econom impact on other small busi small busi in other industri also would be affect by the pcb amend these cost were estim howev to be wide distribut among small firm and general would be distribut in proport to the level of pcb dispos activ also the aggreg cost of these remain item is not veri larg and therefor no signific impact on small busi are forecast among the busi potenti affect are a small number of compani that current have special epa approv to decontamin various type of pcb contamin equip includ pcb transform compon of natur gas pipelin and other for these busi the propos amend might generat addit competit becaus mani more compani would be abl to decontamin equip without need to obtain special epa approv it was judg howev that impact are like to be modest among such firm the compani in question are either confid that their client would not be interest in decontamin their own equip due either to the capit invest requir or the relat eas of use outsid contractor personnel for these function or the pcb decontamin busi repres a modest

pound of pcb wast for dispos base on the data suppli in the petit and supplement inform see note to docket calcul epa calcul that the four petit could involv the import of up to 457 million pound of pcb wast into the unit state for dispos either at myer talmadg ohio facil or in the case of petit 3 at an unspecifi tsca approv inciner prior to dispos myer would transport larg quantiti of pcb wast through the unit state either to the ohio site or to an inciner subsequ to myer dispos activ in ohio an addit 60 to 90 million pound of concentr pcb wast not count ani addit solvent and process wast that myer would generat would have to be transport from ohio to a tsca approv inciner current the closest avail inciner is locat in coffeyvill kansa aptus inc in inform supplement to the petit myer

would be ship from talmadg for inciner myer has fail to demonstr that the propos activ would not pose a risk to health and environ in the unit state the introduct and dispos of larg volum of pcbs would pose some risk of exposur even if the pcbs are dispos of in an epa permit facil such as myer ohio facil or other tsca approv inciner in addit the larg volum of pcbs that would be transport to various facil in differ part of the unit state pose a potenti risk of spill or other exposur to pcbs despit the past safeti record of the transport compani myer also has fail to submit adequ inform

25 1991 the govern also has some mobil dispos facil id some of these facil may be avail to dispos of the pcbs that myer propos to import into the unit state myer also state that lower dispos cost for canadian compani constitut an addit benefit of the propos activ under tsca howev epa doe not consid benefit that may occur accru to foreign busi just as it doe not consid risk that do not threaten domest health or the environ epa is propos to deni myer petit becaus myer has fail to demonstr that the risk of the propos activ are reason when weigh against the benefit particular in view of the

chemic epa believ that under this section it must general consid the issu of the avail of altern and the overal necess for grant an exempt the altern to import of canadian pcb wast into the unit state for destruct is to destroy those wast in canada itself myer maintain in petit 1 that it has investig the possibl of set up a facil in canada to recycl destroy pcb transform and it conclud that it would be uneconom and polit difficult to establish a facil in canada howev myer fail to demonstr that establish a facil in canada is not feasibl rather myer onli forward argument as to whi do so is

establish the need for analyt standard 49 fr 28154 juli 10 1984 becaus of this need the small quantiti limit and the care control condit of pcb manufactur epa find that no unreason risk would result from grant an exempt to chemsyn to manufactur pcbs in small quantiti for research or develop this find also appli to the import of sampl from chemsyn canadian partner wellington laboratori provid that the import sampl are prepar packag and label in the same manner as domest produc sampl becaus the manufactur of these analyt standard is be conduct by high train and experienc profession under control condit and onli small quantiti are involv epa find that no unreason risk would result from grant this exempt as such epa doe not believ that the import of these standard when compar with their domest manufactur would pose ani ad risk to health or the environ the agenc general treat petit for exempt to export pcbs more stringent than petit to distribut pcbs within the unit state this is becaus onc the pcbs cross beyond our border the unit state lose it abil to monitor the handl and distribut activ to inspect the receiv facil for ani regulatori violat or to protect health or the environ from releas of those pcbs that might lead to addit pcb contamin in this countri howev epa believ that those concern are mitig in the export of pcbs in small quantiti for research and develop particular given the quantiti mark and packag of the pcbs as well as the care handl of the pcbs by train laboratori personnel this find would be consist with previous determin regard the export of pcb analyt

with the overal purpos of section 6 e of tsca such as use pcbs as standard for the purpos of measur pcb concentr or use pcbs in the studi of health and environment effect of pcbs becaus in these case there are no pcb substitut there will alway be a need for pure analyt standard to be develop to support laboratori analysi for pcbs also pure pcbs are need in critic health and environment research becaus commerci pcbs contain mixtur of isom and contamin which may advers affect experiment research chemsyn would be prohibit from export pcbs in excess of the amount and quantiti specifi in it petit ie less than 50 gram year and would be requir to petit epa and obtain an exempt prior to an increas in the quantiti or a chang in the manner of handl pcbs under the chemsyn exempt epa would consid ani
