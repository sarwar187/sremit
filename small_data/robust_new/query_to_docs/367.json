and stay for a long time in moscow i was advis not to take it too serious they said unesco is a larg complic organ no matter what you do you will not figur it out and therefor you should look at this

are still around i know quit a few peopl like that my work day here end at 0200 in the morn i have to handl an immens quantiti of busi which has accumul here the collect of the perman mission is not

un bureaucrat told me a veri interest result obtain when the posit of ambassador is occupi not by a person from the ministri of foreign affair but by a nomenklatura appointe and not by a specialist in the area of foreign polici but a person with complet differ baggag of knowledg experi and habit rakhayeva but you i think have alway been a person with differ baggag differ from that of your

use to be confer on polit appointe immedi rakhayeva well yes they accumul experi befor that in parti or other similar work fedotov and sinc i did not have that experi and time have chang as well appar i will have to wait but that is all trivial the fact is that i actual did come with certain idea which had origin previous rakhayeva prior to when you were offer this post fedotov of cours it is simpli that the same idea may be realiz by differ mean and for exampl on the first day when i hand the general director of unesco my credenti i express certain propos in my greet speech one of the thing i propos was to consid the question of have the world communiti in 1997 celebr the 500th anniversari of the code of law of ivan iii the first all russian legal document rakhayeva so do question of law fall under unesco jurisdict as well fedotov well in the first place unesco as an intergovernment organ of the un system is entir construct on intern law plus regul of activ in the sphere of educ scienc and cultur plus copyright law protect of cultur asset under condit of arm conflict restitut for cultur asset rakhayeva yes that is perhap the most pain issu now fedotov it is veri pain but there are also mani other thus i suggest word the question of the code of law of ivan iii like this the 500th anniversari of the all russian rule of law statehood rakhayeva perhap it would be more correct to say attempt at rule of law statehood did it realli exist de facto in ani stage of russian statehood fedotov when we celebr a certain date we usual assum that there have been mani ebb and flow between it and the present day which is natur but as distinct from america we have the possibl of count all russian rule of law statehood almost back to the end of the 15th centuri of cours there are peopl with even more ancient legal canon rakhayeva and with more durabl one that have becom stronger with time sinc they were not alway be uproot like a turnip fedotov it seem to me that if this action goe as it should it will serv as a reinforc for today russian rule of law statehood we will be abl to look at our own root at our own histori and see that mani of our law that exist befor 1917 have a right to be call some of the best in europ but we have gotten way off the subject rakhayeva and all becaus russia ambassador to unesco becam a doctor of legal scienc fedotov well unesco got lucki with lawyer for exampl from 1965 through 1971 the ambassador to unesco was professor of intern law sobakin but that was dure the cold war period it was a complet differ organ and natur a complet differ russian govern the soviet union particip activ in the politic of unesco now it is russia that is exert all effort to contribut to further depolitic becaus unesco object is the intellectu and moral solidar of mankind rakhayeva solidar in spite of what separ us in spite of our econom and polit differ fedotov the intellectu solidar of all countri that are member of unesco in resolv global problem for exampl in genet engin protect of the human genom there are question of molecular biolog studi of the ocean and so forth with the except of health protect which is handl by the who world health organ and question of electron communic which are handl by the intern telecommun union the sphere of scienc cultur educ and communic these are our four pillar natur all these sphere requir legal regul which is provid by two kind of document convent and recommend the convent is the stricter document it must be follow for exampl the univers copyright convent which we join in 1973 or the convent on wetland there is a whole list of them and they are mandatori for all who have sign them and there are the recommend on legal protect of the translat right on protect of the natur and cultur legaci on the nation plane and so forth they are not mandatori but onli recommend but still they are coordin with all so that nobodi will be against them i suggest to unesco general director federico mayor the idea of model law i did not conceiv it but i am tri to introduc it into unesco this is the scholar vision of a law the way scholar imagin it on the basi of experi accumul by legisl of the most divers countri the first stage is the studi of legisl the second synthesi and analysi and final the third develop of a unifi text rakhayeva that is reduc the legisl of various countri to a common denomin fedotov yes standard is what it is rakhayeva but in what area can such a thing be allow so that it doe not look like intervent in intern affair fedotov in no case will it be intervent in intern affair unesco is a bee that fli to various countri and gather pollen and then here in pari it produc honey which feed all countri that are unesco member it is veri import that the model law not be mandatori for ani state but ani state that has decid to adopt for exampl a law on cultur or on educ or on the press or on archiv or on protect of the human genom from all experi conduct today in the area of genet engin regardless of whether it is a larg state with legal tradit or a small one that is just develop they can come to unesco and take the text of the model law rakhayeva that is the task of the legisl from various countri becom extrem simplifi while previous it was necessari for them to come up with their own law in the necessari area frequent quit contradictori one now they are offer a prepar model on a silver platter fedotov take for exampl the law on the press that are in effect in the major of cis countri today all of them were creat on the basi of the russian law that is the union and then russian law but sinc they were all written by the same peopl rakhayeva and we know who these peopl are baturin fedotov entin fedotov where did the similar of law come from what did we do impos our law on the legisl of the cis countri noth of the kind it is simpli that they took the model which was in the first place avail in the second place comprehens and in the third place the one that would fit fair smooth into their legal system the same thing is happen today with copyright legisl if a law is good whi not take it as a model but if russia itself were to send out it law that would be intervent and then out of a sens of contradictori there can aris the question whi russian mayb chines is better the model unesco law should synthes all the best that exist in the russian chines turkish american and so forth and we will obtain the quintess of world experi rakhayeva the problem of the older and younger brother will disappear fedotov it is simpli that the older brother will be all of human there are veri mani sphere for applic of the model law the next day after a meet with unesco general director federico mayor when i share my idea he conven the board of director and said you call me too much of an optimist with regard to russia but it turn out that i was not enough of an optimist in the first place russia has made it regular payment on it debt to the unesco budget and in the second place the russian ambassador has given me three wonder idea rakhayeva one of them was the model law and the other two fedotov let me emphas onc again that it was not i who thought of the model law they alreadi exist in the un system for exampl there is the model crimin code in whose develop our scholar particip immens the second idea is link to question of copyright sinc two organ work with them within the framework of the un system unesco and wipo world intellectu properti organ i suggest to mayor that we determin sphere of interact so that there will be no unnecessari duplic we must find our angl first of all it includ collect measur for combat piraci rakhayeva familiar idea of the former rai director fedotov i present them at the 27th session of the general confer of unesco and receiv support from a number of deleg german spanish french lithuanian and mani other what doe combat piraci mean to us as of today publish piraci and audio and film piraci have reach quit fantast proport rakhayeva it is what they call in the crimin world unbridl behavior fedotov piraci is direct relat to tax evas accord to my figur the piraci busi in russia has a turnov of about 10 billion includ oper involv comput program but doe our state not need this money i think we must join forc with other countri after all it is imposs to fight piraci separ in russia alon rakhayeva no whi not after all we can drop the iron curtain again and solv all our problem at onc fedotov except for one that would mean death to russia and it is precis collect measur for fight piraci that could bring signific invest to russia and open up the treasur hous of world cultur to it becaus as of today we can either obtain them for veri larg amount of money or steal them and sinc we do not have larg amount of money the question is even simpler they are either stolen or bought on the cheap rakhayeva or there are certain philanthrop individu discret action fedotov within the framework of the collect fight against piraci we want to implement the project cultur credit after creat under the aegi of unesco a philanthrop organ that will offer user in russia cabl televis network video salon and so forth for exampl video film at subsid price and licens for them i hope to make it clear to western copyright holder that it is better to get a dollar than to get noth rakhayeva but it will probabl be necessari to explain to the russian entrepreneur as well that it is better to pay this dollar than to put your entir enterpris at risk fedotov unfortun this risk is not veri great today the law exist but not the practic rakhayeva everyth seem to be clear about the second idea and your third idea fedotov when i first arriv here i ask my cowork if there were a document accord to which the money of privat individu and organ that materi support unesco project was exempt from tax i was told that there was not somehow nobodi had ever thought of it but after all ani philanthrop fund stay aliv precis becaus of this it was more difficult to push this idea through but i a neophyt was help by worker of the perman mission among whom there are remark profession i will be sorri if these peopl are call back after their period of resid is over rakhayeva you speak of this as though you had no say in it god giveth and god taketh away fedotov i cannot say that absolut noth depend on me but a great deal still depend on the leadership of the ministri of foreign affair thus we prepar and sent through the general confer a resolut which appeal to unesco member to take measur within the limit of their author to encourag nongovernment organ and privat individu that financ unesco project i immedi inform the ministri of foreign affair of russia of this and prepar the correspond draft of a presidenti edict in a discuss with federico mayor i said that it would be good if follow russia similar law were adopt by other countri and he answer that everyth

collect consider more money for financ unesco project there is veri littl money now unesco is a poor organ rakhayeva especi after the unit state withdrew with such pomp fedotov in the unit state as well as in great britain now more and more peopl are advis in favor of return and with them a larg amount of money will return as well it is import to use this money wise and not to support intern bureaucrat there are problem that affect absolut everyon for exampl ecolog here it is not enough to act separ after all everyth in natur is interconnect and do you know that unesco has declar 1995 a year of toler the offici russian translat is the year of patienc which i object to they tell me that toler is incomprehens i suggest that we should explain it toler is break away from fundament ani kind religi parti ethnic and the accept of various viewpoint closer to this is the term ecumen within the framework of the year of toler there is the hope of organ in moscow a mega concert of the remark french compos and musician jean michel jarr who is a goodwil ambassador to unesco of cours this entail immens difficulti becaus his concert attract not thousand but sometim million of peopl these are concert of the street and squar the most interest thing is that at jean michel jarr concert there are never ani excess as distinct from the concert of the major of rock and pop musician his music calm you down it is toler and this is simpli necessari in russia now rakhayeva yes even more than at ani other time fedotov anoth idea that is link to the year of toler is the star of toler rakhayeva this is appar a titl that will be confer on a person with particular qualiti fedotov not at all it is a satellit that will be launch into lower orbit in the form of two hollow sphere made of light reflect materi and one will rotat around the other they have to be larg enough and at the same time light they will be easi to see from various point imagin a young man stroll with his girlfriend and abov them in the sky is the star of toler and there will be two sphere becaus there are two differ viewpoint two posit and their unif symbol the idea of toler rakhayeva onli perhap not unif but peac coexist fedotov perhap you are right instal in one of these satellit will be a radio transmitt which send signal to earth it will be possibl to receiv them even with the tiniest of receiv instal in a badg a pendant or an earring which will flicker to the tempo of some melodi rakhayeva fantasi fedotov and that is still not all use this radio transmitt it will be possibl to control the light of cultur facil to this one might say the rich they say have their own quirk but for russia this is a veri import product becaus we can launch a satellit use one of the missil to be destroy instead of be cut up into scrap metal the missil will be launch with the star of toler this of cours will requir negoti with the unit state sinc this possibl was not envis by the agreement on the reduct of nuclear weapon i hope they will understand becaus this is good and beauti and when each person see the badg on anoth person he will understand that that person is an advoc of toler patienc for other viewpoint these are the kind of big idea and project we have but there is also an immens number of small project for exampl the creation in nizhniy novgorod under the aegi of unesco of a school that combin secondari educ with farm skill rakhayeva and what stage is that project in now fedotov it is be develop and document is be prepar there is a plan for the reconstruct of the bolshoy theater rakhayeva and is it too much to repair the larg hall of the conservatori fedotov for now it is but the bolshoy theater the russian state librari the former lenin librari and the hermitag these are what unesco has taken on there are mani project relat to scienc for exampl the moscow engin univers under unesco aegi the creation of faculti and school rakhayeva mikhail aleksandrovich did i understand you correct when you said that you came to unesco not to do good for humankind as a whole but in order to do at least someth for russia fedotov that is a rhetor question i came so that cooper with unesco would bring greater advantag to russia and if it is good for russia it will be good for humankind as well rakhayeva but is there ani guarante that by make contribut russia will receiv even an equal amount in return crude yes or no fedotov in financi term of cours there is no such guarante for exampl russia contribut much more to the un than to unesco and what doe it receiv besid the opportun to particip in the peacemak forc but this is how we particip in improv the world order through unesco we achiev concret goal in the sphere of global humanitarian problem true unesco doe not have the money requir for exampl to reconstruct the bolshoy theater but there is a possibl of attract the necessari fund rakhayeva tell me pleas about the mechan for attract fund this is not done through person contact fedotov well whi not it is done through person contact also but unesco has it own perman contact the organ enlist high class specialist conduct expert apprais and render intellectu assist and if the idea of exempt from tax goe through it will be even simpler to attract money i have alreadi compar unesco with a bee onc again if the un is the reason and power of our planet unesco is it soul and conscienc and also it intellect scientif cultur and ideolog rakhayeva and unesco is help to acquir this intellect fedotov rather to concentr and improv it unesco has a multitud of project in this area larg one and some that are not so larg for exampl financ a journal such as inostrannaya literatura and this as you understand is not all the russian academi of scienc receiv 300 000 for subscrib to scientif journal and traine from the former lenin librari are be sent for train to franc germani and great britain at unesco expens and so forth so if you put it all togeth this cover the sum of member contribut the more so sinc so far russia is in debt 60 million we are gradual pay it off i do not think that russia has the right to be a debtor rakhayeva as a great power and also as a countri where today everyth is one big unexpect event fedotov it is simpli necessari to be abl to collect money i think we have an absolut incorrect tax polici we must lower tax and stiffen liabil for pay them rakhayeva and is it true that the televis program russian univers come out under the aegi of unesco fedotov it doe and it will continu to i

least three year behind barb wire is forc zhirinovskiy to look for a way out of the danger situat he has found himself in it seem that it is specif for this purpos that what at first appear to be a senseless scandal is now be hatch ms kulikova claim that the book sponsor have perpetr a forgeri her argument sound pretti strang and even illog howev you can see place in the book which have been purpos print in boldfac so as to attract the attent of corrupt journalist like you izvestiya journalist ms kulikova said struck by the typefac i ask her about these evil sponsor i am not go to give you their name but believ me they are to blame for everyth came the answer apart from the boldfac in certain place ms kulikova drew attent to two other terribl circumst zhirinovskiy real text contain bit of his speech and we remov all the repetit but in the pirat book the text look as though vladimir volfovich keep say the same thing over and over irina sergeyevna bitter observ is entir just but onli from the viewpoint of an art critic mayb she doe not know that deliber repetit in the structur of a speech were consid to be the most success propagandist devic even among orat in ancient greec after all the crowd doe not hear it feel in order for the sens of what has been said to be brought home the same thing has to be drum into it sever time carri away by the convers ms kulikova said that she person place the floppi contain the text of the book in the sponsor hand this text was simpli dictat by zhirinovskiy on kulikova own admiss she is not so much his editor as a proofread and she never chang the sens of what has been said from the day of public and up until the end of januari when the investig from the general prosecutor offic final got down to read the book it did not enter anyon head that this was a forgeri even zhirinovskiy head asid from that there are more ration proof of ident the secret sponsor are in fact indic at the end of zhirinovskiy book the pisatel limit partnership and the bukvitsa publish cooper it was they who put in an order at moscow print work no 13 to publish the book as yuliya mikhaylovna lobacheva chief of the product depart of this print work assur us the client licens was perfect in order admit of the 75 000 copi of last dash to the south order the print work onli print 35 000 you see we do not take order without prepay and they onli paid for half of the print run we print 34 000 in the normal cover and anoth 1 000 in a prepubl cover just as they ask asid from that i do not understand how this book can be pirat if zhirinovskiy wave it around at everi news confer he hold ms lobacheva said these 1 000 copi in the prepubl version were sold to deputi in the state duma from this you can conclud that zhirinovskiy is unbeliev prudent in matter of propaganda but the interfer of the general prosecutor offic upset some of his plan the sale of the book within the wall of the state duma organ by the ldpr leader in no way squar with the idea of a pirat public in ani case zhirinovskiy in no way look like a victim here but ms kulikova is so keen on the piraci theme that she has complet reject the fact of the sale of the book in the state duma dont believ it it lie the art critic exclaim there is no such book as last dash to the south and there never has been this is onli the second part of zhirinovskiy trilog on the fate of russia rip out of context that book will be on sale soon let us sum up so no one has chang the essenc of the publish text but admit object have been made about the typefac this is evid not enough to confus the investig from the general prosecutor offic particular sinc the titl page of last dash to the south bear the vv zhirinovskiy copyright symbol mayb this is a complet differ vv it doe not

our navi present and futur in my opinion the main thing in the interview was the present of the mission that the navi must be readi to accomplish for the purpos of russia secur and defens it appear to us that the mission were correct set forth and inde we would like for them to have been word not in such general term but in more specif term howev there is someth contain in aa kokoshin respons that put us on guard i was especi concern by aa kokoshin statement i would not say that we have a new shipbuild program in it tradit sens i think that there must be a weapon develop program on the whole where the navi will be a compon it obvious that the understand of this compon was engend by an underestim of the navi role in the system of defens and protect of russia interest under contemporari

the reason whi adequ attent is not be devot to the navi in the current militari doctrin is certain contain in these two quot i dont know if it is worth repeat that russia maritim border is approxim 40 000 kilomet which is more than two time it land border and more than the coast line of all of europ and we also need to protect and when necessari defend this border or recal the rapid increas signific of the continent shelf maritim econom zone etc the protect of which is becom a veri import mission just like ensur safeti of navig and fish consequ the statement that russia is more a land than a naval power is not onli groundless but also contain a distort of russia geostrateg posit and a disparag of our navi role we can agre with the fact that russia militari fate as a rule has been decid on land but we must not forget that in all war the navi was not onli the armi loyal assist but also an activ particip of mani joint with ground troop and aviat battl for the sake of victori to disparag the navi role and signific mean to cancel out it 300 year histori and to forget it achiev under the leadership of peter i spiridov ushakov senyavin lazarev nakhimov essen kuznetsov and to

is extrem rash to assert that there is no threat if not of war than of the emerg of arm conflict into which russia and the other cis countri could be drawn at the same time the experi of all of the latest most serious conflict point toward an increas of the signific of the oper of aviat and naval forc in them which attest to the increas of the danger precis from the maritim axe in an articl publish in nezavisimaya gazeta on 8 februari 1994 the author critic our militari doctrin becaus it doe not indic a specif enemi against whom we are creat the arm forc but do we need to repeat previous error in my view we must not seek specif enemi but build the arm forc from the calcul that they could appear from ani direct and becaus we must put a stop to ani infring on the sovereignti and integr of russia and the cis countri we must be readi to accomplish that mission becaus it is simpli imposs to restructur anyth especi the navi in a short period of time proceed from what has been state abov in my opinion it is advis to word our navi mission as follow 1 ensur the secur of russia and the cis countri from the naval axe in my view we must consid the primari danger to be strike by sea launch long rang cruis missil the platform of which are surfac combat and submarin today this is the tomahawk sea launch long rang cruis missil with a launch rang of approxim 3 000 kilomet this permit them to destroy target locat on the european territori of russia to the ural all target in belorussia belarus ukrain moldova north caucasus and central asia dure launch from the barent norwegian and mediterranean sea from the north atlant and even from the indian ocean from the area of the sea of japan sea of okhotsk and the pacif ocean all target of russia to the irkutsk meridian carrier base and strateg aviat are anoth danger from the maritim axe we can compar the destruct radius of carrier base aircraft especi with the util of airfield of contigu state upon their return with the launch rang of sea launch long rang cruis missil and even strateg aviat the most effect weapon to repel sea launch long rang cruis missil and carrier base aviat strike is to bring pressur to bear against their platform and onli an effect navi that has been deploy dure the threaten period in the detect area of their combat maneuv is capabl of combat them 2 constant mainten of naval strateg nuclear forc at a high degre of readi consid their veri import function of deter aggress paramount attent must be devot to ensur their high combat readi the reliabl of command and control and dissemin combat command and control signal and also the defens of base and dispers area and patrol area becaus they becom the number 1 target of destruct with the initi of combat oper 3 defens of extern and intern maritim line of communic and other econom and scientif activ in remot area of the sea and ocean here late isnt it strang the struggl with piraci on the high sea is onc again becom urgent and accord to

our fleet forc in peacekeep action base upon un secur council decis to put a stop to arm conflict all of the indic mission for the defens of russian and the cis state from the maritim axe are time even today their accomplish requir daili readi and aggress activ from our fleet becaus onli they are capabl of accomplish them with the requir effect and to do that we need a proper navi and not onli in support of russia but also in support of all of the commonwealth of independ state it seem to me that today the need for the creation of unifi naval forc in support of the cis with share particip in this matter of all commonwealth countri is alreadi quit obvious becaus practic all of them separ are incap of creat modern even if small nation naval forc or of maintain them incident i did not make a slip of the tongu when i employ the term yedinyy voyenno morskiy sili sng cis unifi naval forc all the same a navi is onli ship submarin and support ship howev today besid that it also has at

besid the weapon that are pure specif for it has at it dispos practic all of the weapon that the other servic of the arm forc have which make it naval forc design more correct i am in total agreement with aa kokoshin that we dont need tradit shipbuild program in that sens and with those approach as we previous understood them we should have long ago orient ourselv on the develop of integr combat system that organ combin ship of various class their weapon and support system which incident navi specialist have dream of for year then we would not have that larg collect of ship and submarin design type of weapon for them and other similar shortcom but along with that while consid the technic complex of the structur of the navi we need not a separ compon of common weapon but an independ naval forc develop program that meet the new condit in the process specialist naval profession must be involv with it develop the russian govern must approv it and the cis head of state council must approv it for the unifi naval forc dure the cours of this work each design for a ship weapon system or support system must be base upon it need compat and of cours cost effect criteria but to prevent a return to the customari past the approv of decis on these issu must occur at the government level base on the conclus of an independ committe of expert we must enlist the appropri naval expert practition at the level of command of fleet and flotilla both activ command and those who held these post in the past and also scientist design manufactur and other expert in the work of the committe of expert onli they must mandatorili be independ of those depart which have vest interest in obtain more expens and therefor profit order that do not alway satisfi the navi as this frequent occur in the past a small team of consult on naval affair could be form from them the absenc of which is alreadi be felt it function must includ the organ of that independ committe of expert and prepar of find and the appropri government decre base upon it as for ship submarin and naval weapon here obvious the reduct of their nois level and weight and dimens specif of all system the develop of missil ship

number of increas new design becaus they receiv coloss bonus and thousand of award for each of them and the highest leader of depart even receiv the rank of hero of the soviet union or hero of

market is increas and as the owner of unlaw factori are overt and covert compet with each other for better sale the retail price of pirat cds have drop drastic for exampl one can buy a larg number of pirat cds at hk 11 to hk 12 each the retail price of pirat cds around the zhu jiang delta region now rang from 12 to 18 yuan wherea in hong kong three pirat cds are sold for hk 100 peopl can find such

alreadi have put up warn poster in open space at everi port of entri and exit note that no one is allow to carri pirat cds onc convict one face a maximum penalti of two year imprison and a hk 1 000

pirat cds quit open and busi is brisk owe to the great demand zhongshan guangzhou becom distribut center apart from higher price than those sold in the mainland in hong kong we cannot test the sound

follow the law to stop piraci as a matter of fact it is believ that pirat cds will continu to exist for a long time until there is a perfect system of legal control in the mainland owe to their cheap price and fair qualiti with onli a certain amount of hum it is veri difficult for consum to resist them mani consum hold that unless the price of origin compact disc are mark down drastic they will not find these disc more attract henc it is believ that to put an end to pirat cds the ultim method is for businessmen produc origin cds to play down their motiv of make huge profit and let the market

not been abl to present this case strong to this date pakistan has talk a lot about self determin howev it doe not understand what this term mean if we talk about self determin within the framework of all countri in the world everi countri has the danger of break up self determin can lead onli to break up a countri just like ani other countri india also has it own border is it possibl that peopl from ani part of india should ask for separ from india base on their self determin right obvious we cannot endang ani nation uniti this way no part of india can be separ from it and we must explain

who are train in pakistan and sent to our countri for carri on murder and carnag in our countri i would like to ask a basic question of the american have they read the histori of india do they know that the thousand of year old indian cultur is base on human right the foundat of our thousand of year old civil and cultur is human right our nation civil never practic piraci our nation has never colon anoth countri we never even thought about colon our nation gave birth to mahatma buddha bhagwan mahavir and mahatma gandhi these are the peopl who are known as ambassador of peac and non violenc in the whole world the unit state itself fought a bloodi battl to keep it uniti what lesson can it give us about human right today other civil in the world have taken lesson from us in this subject it is surpris that whoever talk about human right in kashmir onli see the secur forc they never mention human right violat commit by the terrorist who are play with the live of innoc citizen day and night they do not mention that their extrem action and atroc have forc hundr and thousand of kashmiri to flee their home and live in camp outsid delhi our govern has fail to shed light on this aspect of terror in kashmir we can easili find an answer to this question if we recogn whether the terrorist or the secur forc came to kashmir first it is clear that the terrorist came there and spread terror and tri to break up our countri that is when the need to send the secur forc there was felt the secur forc are protect live and properti of the citizen in kashmir i want to tell the us administr that the un resolut about hold a plebiscit that pakistan talk about day and night also call for pakistan to vacat the part of kashmir it is occupi we have fail to communic this fact also is it not surpris that they are talk about hold a plebiscit by separ it from the whole resolut we are be veri care i know the problem the govern is face it has to go to the world bank and borrow money from the imf the situat is such that india cannot function without borrow money everyth will close we cannot borrow money from these intern organ until the unit state support our request howev when india digniti is challeng when india self respect is challeng then in my opinion we should remain hungri and not give the unit state the right to trifl with our nation pride the situat is veri pain when we give our statement with such hesit fear that we do not get out of the diplomat languag we are not will to pawn our nation pride and digniti to even the most power nation in the world the unit state or ani other nation when it come to kashmir and india uniti the indian peopl are will to remain hungri but are not will to compromis their self respect we have to understand this perfect i am now hear some talk in my own countri about start a polit process in kashmir i also support the polit process howev i have some question befor we do that my first point is that polit process has been tri in kashmir for a long time we had a govern elect by democrat process function there this polit process has been work for sever decad the govern elect by the peopl ran the busi in kashmir how did terror aris while these govern were there now if we think that a polit process is necessari to end terror i do not want to muddl up this issu by say that the present situat in kashmir has result most

within the framework of the reform of the armi and navi in particular dure the second stage of the reform 1993 1995 it was propos to have 21 million men and dure the third after 1995 it was propos to

cover quit a broad spectrum probabl the most popular idea now commonplac is that almost one of the main way of stabil russia budget is the continu and intens reduct of militari spend by cut the

ventur to judg the valid of such argument from the scientif viewpoint i will leav that to academ but i cannot remain silent about someth that seem to me to be obvious what is obvious is our vast countri which is uniqu in it geopolit situat yes russia posit in the post soviet space is such that it is now separ from the west european countri not onli by the central and east european countri but also by a second belt the baltic countri belorussia belarus ukrain moldavia moldova the length of coastlin in the west and south has been sharpli reduc but at the same time from the geopolit viewpoint russia retain mani element of the ussr posit it territori is at the intersect between europ and asia and it has common border with christian in the west and muslim in the south state and with countri with a confucian ideolog in the east the shore of russia are wash by the water of 12 sea and three ocean and it retain long maritim border in the north and east on top of that you have abund natur

this accord influenc it task structur and man level and the orient of troop train now it is a border district moreov the situat there requir an adequ militari presenc on russia part so to speak all this must be taken into account somehow now let us turn to the rang of task which accord to the provis of the militari doctrin russia armi and navi must be readi to resolv the main danger to stabil

subscrib it been a mix year for cabl but if you look at the fundament of the busi there has been record invest record build yes the penetr rate is come down a bit were disappoint but not realli concern we are convinc it will come back that the market is go to buy the product the cta chairman say this year a total of pound 750m will be invest in the construct of cabl network in the uk more than in ani previous three or four year period but what if the british peopl simpli do not want multi channel televis or at least the programm now be offer mani of the big cabl oper have carri out their own consum research just to make sure that there is not an invis insuper barrier i dont think there is anyth in the cultur of the british peopl that say that over time they wont want multi channel say mr bate and even if adult were to behav in that pervers way then the children will certain understand cabl and the choic it offer anoth straw in the wind is the fact that not all cabl oper are perform so veri modest in birmingham for instanc the penetr rate is run at 33 5 per cent and anyth over 30 per cent banker say is definit a busi becaus of the cash flow generat if onli the rest could lift their game to the birmingham level cabl enthusiast say to mr turner the real challeng doe not come from bskyb but from the 75 per cent of the popul who do not have multi channel televis of ani kind bskyb itself has recent taken an enorm risk in move toward a near total subscript packag the onli bskyb except is the loss make sky news on the day sky televis was launch in februari 1989 mr murdoch made it clear that other servic apart from movi could be encrypt or scrambl and charg for on a month basi there is a larg risk in charg for a servic that has previous been free last year sky start to charg for it sport channel and this autumn sky one disappear from the gaze of those not prepar to pay mr murdoch himself fear there could have been uproar at the decis to charg but against all the odd if anyth the opposit has happen satellit dish sale start to rise after a period of slower growth part this was the result of massiv public and part it was a respons to care structur special deal and discount perhap abov all els the pill of have to pay was sugar by the arriv of new non murdoch channel in the packag so that at least by the begin of next year there will be a total

librari of the bbc and thame televis and countri music televis are avail in the multi channel packag for pound 99 a month the equival of the basic tier of channel in the cabl televis packag paradox the simpl subscript packag may be easier to sell than the previous mixtur where some channel were onli on subscript and other were free peopl understand the subscript packag it easier to sell say mr paul mcmullan of east antrim electr who has sold satellit equip sinc the earli day of sky televis the logic of the move to subscript is unassail in financi term as long as sky can retain most of it exist viewer and start to build again as each new satellit channel becom avail the audienc for the new media as oppos to the tradit broadcast is further fragment the smaller the audienc howev good the target or the demograph the less signific that audienc is for advertis although there will inevit will be element of cross over the most obvious way to maximis the choic avail to the public is for it to be fund by three separ stream of revenu a licenc fee advertis and subscript the new subscript revenu could transfer bskyb balanc sheet although the compani will have to be sure that the subscrib are be given valu for money and not progress milk onc they are hook on the extra choic viewer have been persuad to pay a month subscript for a sport channel that use to be free larg as a result of the exclus pound 305m deal to show live premier leagu game but if sky were to take some of the best game out of the exist packag and charg an addit pay per view fee that might turn out to be a step too far for mani of their custom sky has said it will launch a pay per view servic next year possibl at the same time as a second sport channel begin broadcast although littl has been said about what sort of event will be offer on the pay per view menu bskyb has made consider financi progress in the past two year and at least at the oper level is now make more than pound 2m a week although there is still a pre tax loss of about pound 70m a year when notion interest payment on the pound 7bn invest in the project are includ next year the money will start to flow back to the owner of the consortium who have so far not actual paid each other the interest on their loan to the ventur apart from news corpor and pearson the main investor are the granada group and chargeur of franc compar with the enorm loss of the past the figur that mr richard brook bskyb chief financi offic announc for the year to june 1993 were remark the oper profit of pound 61 5m repres a pound 108m turnaround on the previous year and turnov was up by 63 per cent to pound 380m 80 per cent of it come from subscript revenu in addit the satellit consortium had need no new fund from sharehold sinc may 1992 and pound 34m of avail fund had not had to be drawn down it seem like a turn point of some signific and execut promis the improv trend were continu into the current financi year mr gari davey the bskyb deputi manag director point out last month that 100 000 new movi channel subscript had been sign up in august alon take the total of movi subscript past 2m for the first time bskyb is face a grow problem of pirat subscript card news corpor videocrypt system base on a microchip embed in a card rather like a telephon card which unlock the scrambl pictur was claim to be pirat proof in fact pirat card are be open advertis and sold in scandinavia and germani and the trend is start to spread to the uk one compani in england is alreadi offer pirat card for sale at pound 200 in what amount to an unoffici

would simpli mean the loss of revenu or potenti revenu but in continent europ the problem could be even more signific the satellit compani buy onli the uk subscript right to holli wood film which are

overal bskyb was in more than 5m home by the begin ning of septemb includ 57m home with satellit dish accord to barb yet although the new channel are avail in more than 15 per cent of uk home it has to be emphasis that their perform in term of audienc and rate has been modest it is a rare satellit programm that has been abl to assembl an audienc of 1m and few apart from the simpson have achiev it despit the rapid growth in the number of channel avail abl the new media still account for less than a third of total view in home which can receiv satellit channel this ratio look like stay fair constant or onli increas slight as more channel are ad this suggest that satellit channel at least at their present stage of develop will have to content them selv with share a finit amount of view time and reli instead for growth in get their servic into an increas number of home for instanc in march befor the latest burst of new channel on the astra satellit such as bravo discoveri nickelodeon

expens of transport and buri which the govern was no longer abl to control after the break up of the ussr went up so much that the fleet could not keep on shoulder them so it began sell radioact wast to the middl east via two argentin intermediari compani whose ship took the scrap in area 9 in the sea of japan the pacif fleet intellig agenc have inform to the effect that four of the two compani ship anchor off the shorelin of iran and that this was the last stop on their voyag back from the sea of japan anoth ship escap the eye of the intellig servic while a green peac patrol frustrat the load oper of a ship from southern europ that had been rent by one of the two intermediari compani it captain decid not to approach the tnt 27 tanker for fear that the green peac observ would spot what his ship was carri and then rais a ruckus upset the whole world for this reason the korean ship left area 9 without have load the nuclear scrap then the captain of the russian tanker and the pacif fleet command launch an attack on green peac accus them of ordinari piraci one of the offic of the tanker crew said that if ani of the green peac rabbl had tri to come on board his ship he would have order them toss into the ocean actual said aleksandr mikhailov the sailor of the pacif fleet are give serious consider to attempt by green peac to monitor the movement of ship carri the flag of the russian naval forc even if they are support ship becaus this injur their feel as militari peopl who serv their flag and it depriv them of a sourc of incom especi sinc the russian govern repres by minist of intern affair yerin has given them permiss to earn part of their live in this manner but the most import thing about this scandal is that the radioact liquid nuclear wast more than like is noth but a cover for the basic cargo that the rent korean ship decid not to take when the file was close on japan protest via the russian prime minist announc that he was ban from now on the dispos of the pacif fleet radioact liquid scrap in the sea of japan a disput broke out between the prime minist and the pacif fleet command and perhap the russian naval forc in general this disput may becom even more aggrav if the pacif fleet command fair soon doe not find a new way or cover for deliv nuclear wast to it custom abroad in order to maintain this fleet sailor addit mean of earn their livelihood fruit in exchang for nuclear materi appar the worri about the cut off of the flow of use nuclear materi and nuclear fuel scrap from russian submarin to foreign compani is preoccupi not onli the sailor of the pacif fleet but also and perhap even more so the buyer on the even of 20 octob two day after green peac had announc that it had spot an attempt to dump nuclear materi into the sea there arriv in moscow come from dusseldorf germani an iranian citizen by the name of farhat sayyidi farsangadari name as transliter chairman of the board of the iranian trade and invest compani call the fari group as transliter the owner of a compani call fsf headquart in the dusseldorf suburb of duren which has the job of suppli fruit to germani and export industri technolog and other equip to iran it is said that farsangadari arriv in moscow in order to review the data of the moscow branch of the fari group the thing that attract the attent of the russian ministri of secur concern farsangadari visit was that a quantiti of nuclear materi had been spot be smuggl from russia to estonia in the russian district of pskov the final destin of these materi was suppos to be the fsf compani in the dusseldorf suburb the thing that caus peopl to take an even greater interest in this compani is the fact that it had financ recreat trip for sever russian famili in anatolia instanbul malta and the canari island the peculiar thing about this matter was that the head of these famili were specialist work in the nuclear research institut in the town of dubna the district of moscow the synchrotron instal in protvino and the nuclear instal in the town of arzama 16 a town which was not shown on ani map print in the soviet union becaus it was a top secret area these expert also had gone to iran as for the recreat trip for their famili which had been organ by mr farsangadari the famili end up join the head of their famili in iran monitor the activ of the compani that farsangadari own turn up the fact that one of it employe who had close tie to the chief a man by the name of shariqi had visit the resort of bad em in the rhein valley in the spring of 1993 not as a person seek rest and recreat but rather as correspond for iranian newspap that are publish in the nation provinc and as their deleg to a meet in this german resort town of high rank specialist charg with the task of monitor the non prolifer of nuclear weapon organ by the moultre name as transliter institut for intern relat the unit state and the frankfurt institut for world issu germani these meet are held twice a year and those particip in them are repres of the basic nuclear power and the larg european nation this time they were join by repres from ukrain and kazakhstan two new nuclear power shariqi who speak good english and german and also understand russian did not go out of his way to inform the reader of the newspap that he repres and there are not mani such reader concern the proceed of the meet held by those task to monitor ani movement of nuclear materi in russia ukrain and kazakhstan where no such monitor has yet been impos or where it doe not fulfil all the condit main what he did was to occupi himself with make contact with nuclear expert from russia ukrain and kazakhstan this is whi the russian secur apparatus concentr it attent on farsangadari visit to moscow after the scandal that origin in the sea of japan particular sinc he came accompani by shariqi it is difficult to say whether or not the chairman of the board of the fari group was serious in monitor the data of the moscow branch whose headquart occupi the third floor of an old municip build near the embassi of the armenian republ in downtown moscow and deal in suppli fruit alcohol beverag veget soap and cosmet to russia and import industri equip electr applianc dish spoon and aluminum fork iran doe not need kitchen utensil but it doe need aluminum but one thing is for sure and that is that he spent lot of time meet with russian citizen who came to moscow from izhevsk arzama 16 and krasnoyarsk 26 which are the center of the russian nuclear weapon and space apparatus industri it was obvious that the fari group import not onli dish and aluminum from russia but also human expertis particular peopl who work or still work in the sector of militari product rafsanjani deal in kazakhstan on 23 octob farsangadari and shariqi left moscow and flew to alma ata arriv there at the same time as iranian presid ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani who came to hold talk with the presid of kazakhstan nursultan nazarbayev farsangadari name was not on the list of those accompani the iranian presid howev he met with him in the kazakh capit and remain in constant contact with a number of the presid advis it should be mention that farhat sayyidi farsangadari belong to an old establish nobl iranian famili that was close to the throne and distanc itself from the last iranian shah dure the white revolut becaus of violent action taken against the interest of the famili howev the famili also remain distant from khomeyni sinc it consid him to be an extremist it seem that iran present govern has noth against this famili otherwis it would not be cooper with it even though farsangadari his wife and his two daughter perman resid in germani after alma ata farsangadari and shariqi went on a quick trip to semipalatinsk the locat of the underground nuclear test site sinc most of the peopl work there are in the russian militari it was natur for the russian ministri of secur to have inform there who told moscow that the two iranian guest had met with the kazakh leader as well as a number of employe of most russian and armenian origin who play a role in previous underground nuclear explos the particip in these meet kept silent about what happen in them but everyon knew the secret the discuss dealt with invit specialist to work in iran especi sinc the test site had not been hold ani test or do ani work by mean of which they could earn their live and the fact that they had no futur in either kazakhstan or russia after farsangadari return to the kazakh capit from semipalatinsk he was receiv by the iranian presid befor he had his last meet with presid nazarbayev after that meet some observ reveal the fact that the iranian presid had propos to his kazakh counterpart that he sell to iran the scrap from the nuclear arsenal that kazakhstan had agre to destroy in the near futur what was meant by arsenal in this case was not onli the rocket part and their nuclear warhead but also the test site equip in semipalatinsk that was go to be dismantl and which was need by iran a countri that is on the verg of test it nuclear bomb and which they say has begun to equip a test site in the northeastern part of the countri accord to avail inform iraq want to acquir what remain of the ukrainian nuclear arsenal and this is whi iran has near reach agreement with kazakhstan concern purchas it nuclear instal as well as the necessari equip and technolog to make it possibl to conduct experi with nuclear explos in ani case there is no doubt that the two side have agre in write with regard to their intent to make deal such as these abov and beyond that tehran hope to get someth by mean of smuggl materi and human expertis the curious thing is that presid rafsanjani when pass through baku on his way back from kazakhstan issu a verbal threat on behalf of the muslim of the world against the armenian aggressor but these threat were littl more than an effort to flatter his azerbaijani host the larg armenian communiti in iran occupi an influenti posit in busi and trade in addit to the fact that there are lot of armenian specialist most of whom have come to iran recent especi from armenia who work in iranian nuclear instal and the scientif research institut and plant that had the job of produc soviet nuclear weapon missil and space equip were locat in all of the soviet republ includ armenia right now armenian nuclear scientist and technician cannot find ani work in the field that they work in becaus of the unemploy crisi that has led to a paralysi of the entir armenian industri and becaus of the cut off of necessari suppli that use to come from plant scatter all over the former soviet union that they use to deal with for this reason they are look for work in other countri especi in iran and iraq where they see great opportun to util their expertis and knowledg thus it is doubt that tehran would antagon the armenian communiti which support the iranian regim econom and financi and produc it weapon this is someth that baku appar also realiz and alma ata feel that the nuclear arsenal it is be forc to destroy could bring lot of revenu to kazakhstan if it would do the smart thing with it rubbl alma ata could earn an estim hundr of million of dollar if it to some degre also oversaw this unlicens busi trip to the plutonium burial site the activ of the iranian envoy in russia indic that tehran is take serious practic step to get what it want after the talk in kazakhstan were over farsangadari and shariqi return to moscow from there the former went to dusseldorf while the latter took a plane to the russian citi of ekaterinburg on 5 novemb where he rode by automobil to the citi of verkhn isetsk a citi that was not shown on map of the soviet union and to which entri was deni even to soviet citizen unless they had special permiss it is known now that this citi is the locat of one of the center of the soviet nuclear industri shariqi stay in this citi till 10 novemb and met with a number of peopl from the citi as well as some guest who came in from chelyabinsk and krasnoyarsk it is not difficult to figur out the topic dealt with by the iranian guest at these meet especi if we know that in chelyabinsk 40 and krasnoyarsk 26 they have buri larg quantiti of use nuclear fuel which came from all of the soviet fleet soviet nuclear power plant and even from finnish nuclear instal also for exampl after the break up of the soviet union into independ republ no less than three ton of plutonium was sent there from ukrain it is said that ukrain appar want to regain this plutonium in order to sell it and for this reason refus to pay the bill for buri it howev the nuclear weapon non prolifer treati forbid russia from return the plutonium to ukrain becaus it is offici at least not a nuclear power in such a case some of those in charg of buri the nuclear wast might embark upon sell these materi without permiss the reason be that they would of cours want to serv both the public interest and privat interest russian circl do not doubt that those work at the nuclear test site in semipalatinsk steer the iranian toward the nuclear scrap burial site in chelyabinsk and krasnoyarsk and that those in charg of these burial site knew in advanc that a repres from the iranian militari industri complex was come to verkhn isetsk so they went there to meet him whatev the case might be the iranian buyer met the russian seller in verkhn isetsk and then they made a deal their problem now is to figur out how to ship the materi to the iranian buyer the rout across the baltic republ is no longer a good one becaus it is now be strict monitor and not even falsifi document will fool them so the onli thing left for the supplier to do is choos between a rout through the central asian republ which are not separ from russia by border obstacl and a rout through the northern caucasus area and azerbaijan bear in mind that the caucasus area is full of highway bandit led by field command who are subject to no author and do not hesit to steal oil from pipelin and confisc truck load with powder milk and children cloth but the most import question is what will the russian secur forc do sinc they are awar of these suspici deal the problem is that the secur apparatus has to be content to mere monitor the buyer and seller becaus there are no law that allow them to arrest them the most that the law allow is for them to arrest a move convoy but this is someth that is hard to do as for the steal from the graveyard that is someth which in practic cannot be prove a thief can dump a ton of sand into the grave instead of the scrap that contain a high proport of plutonium and mix the sand with the radioact materi and it is imposs to tell the differ as for conduct analyt test of the whole burial site this is someth that is veri expens to do and doe not serv the purpos consequ if the person who rais all the ruckus concern dump liquid nuclear wast in the sea of japan on 17 octob had the goal of elimin the suppli channel of russian nuclear materi to place abroad via the pacif fleet in particular then most probabl he did not get what he want as long as there are good for which there is a demand and those who possess the good wish to sell them they will alway find way to market them illeg as for the nuclear materi and technolog those person in russia who possess them see no reason not to smuggl them to countri who are rush to grab these commod as long as there is no obstacl that make do busi with nuclear materi either legal or illeg someth that is not profit either as far as russia or the other former soviet nuclear republ are concern", "score": -8.566623599401646, "doc_id": "FBIS3-22831", "rank": 394}, {"doc_text": "bfn bohemia bank lose

approach of the countri of northeast asia to the problem of ensur secur after the epoch of the cold war text mani russian and foreign research note that the benefici consequ of the end of the cold war have seem not touch the extens asia pacif region and primarili the region of northeast asia which is of vital import for the russian feder howev these statement bear a rather general charact nevertheless if we examin the situat in the region more close here too we may note some strike posit chang first of all this is reflect in the fact that after mani year of indiffer to the far east in russia a distinct foreign polici cours for northeast asia has emerg for the first time this cours was formul by rf russian feder presid bori yeltsin dure his visit to the republ of korea and the peopl republ of china in 1992 as well as in the april 1993 foreign polici concept of the russian feder which contain a section on northeast asia as for the unit state of america it was as if this region had remain at the back door of their geopolit interest for a long time they consid the pacif ocean to be their own specif lake in which their nation secur was reliabl guarante by a system of bilater agreement at the center of this system was the 1960 japanes american agreement on cooper and guarante of secur the treati and agreement of the usa with the republ of korea taiwan the philippin thailand singapor and other countri were concentr around it altogeth they compris the firm construct so call american system of secur which as western polit scientist maintain brought northeast asia long term peac stabil and econom prosper quit recent the clinton administr also came to the conclus that it was imposs to continu to live with the old baggag the new world order persist dictat the need for a review of the american posit in the asia pacif region and a transform of the bilater relat into some kind of multilater structur or mechan which would better correspond to the demand of the time in touch upon the russian concept of secur we cannot overlook the articl by the well known scientist and china specialist dr b zanegin which was publish in pravda on 13 august 1993 under the titl the cold war still continu in this articl he attack the foreign polici cours of the russian feder which stem from the abov mention concept the author come to the conclus that russia diplomat activ in northeast asia in practic amount to the implement of an unfriend and even hostil essenti confront polici in regard to the socialist countri parallel to or in conjunct with the usa and other anti communist regim and to gross intervent by russia in the cold war in the asia pacif region 1 after such a statement one want to ask how such a respect research risk negat all of moscow effort in step up diplomaci in this geopolit direct which is so vital to it the question aris doe dr zanegin understand what constitut russia nation interest in this region if so he would hard character russia foreign polici as be built on the dogma of anti communism and synonym orient toward the usa 2 in fact an unprejud analysi of russia foreign polit concept speak of the fact that it eman from the general nation interest of the russian feder which consist of the follow in domest polici which is given a prioriti direct preserv of russia as an integr free independ and democrat state and for this it is first of all necessari to normal the manag of the state preserv and formul of an econom space for busi interact within the framework of the former ussr stabil of the economi and financ creation of a social orient market economi and ultim the achiev of econom prosper step by step implement of convers with intern support in foreign polici maintain the countri defens capabl at the necessari level and ensur it extern secur develop friend polit and mutual benefici trade econom tie communiat and humanitarian exchang with all state on a global and region level includ especi in the asia pacif region where russia has a rather extens marin boundari preserv a stabl and safe peac in the region includ northeast asia and on the planet as a whole construct particip in the activ of the un and other intern organ as we can see from this far from complet list of russian interest and simpli to list them would take up sever journal column it is unlik that anyon would be bold enough to formul them in full volum almost all of them are direct at ensur intern stabil and achiev prosper of a multi nation state this constitut their basic differ from the confront foreign polit doctrin of the former ussr of the cold war time howev the russian feder doe not deni in ani aspect it geopolit and strateg role in the asia pacif region and on the contrari intend to activ particip in all measur of this extens region includ also in the creation of a reliabl mechan for ensur collect secur howev this certain doe not mean that it is pursu a confront polici what new challeng are be present under current condit to the state of northeast asia includ russia which oppos the nation interest of the countri in the region and the prospect of creat a reliabl system of collect secur this is primarili the emerg of tendenc toward hegemon in the world arena and in the region here too we should mention the region and ethnic conflict also take place within russia and in it nearbi foreign countri the retent of exist and desir to creat new close militari polit union and the present of territori claim by a number of countri to other state this concern also the rather controversi japanes encroach on the so call northern territori belong to the russian feder undoubt this list must also includ the exist limit on free trade and the obstacl to exchang of lead technolog although assur were given at the juli summit of the seven g 7 summit in tokyo that the limit impos by cocom coordin committe on multilater export control in regard to russia would be remov befor the end of the current centuri moscow could not help but feel that the same mistrust is be exhibit toward it as had been dure the period of the cold war whose rudiment are still seen in mani thing but in ani case not in the polici of the russian feder ani form of ideolog of interst relat is also one of the varieti of new challeng which must be overcom by current diplomaci russia as we know doe not speak out against the bilater agreement exist in northeast asia which compris the system of secur for the usa and it alli in the period of the cold war at that time this system evid was justifi howev under the new condit after the end of the cold war a real need has arisen for the parti to declar in some form in the japanes american secur pact which is central in the system of allianc in the region that henceforth it will not be direct against other countri of the region this is the will of the time to the list of new challeng we should add the drug trade expand terror piraci as well as anoth legaci of the cold war the continu of larg scale joint train exercis by naval and other type of arm forc near the territori of other state the probabl of prolifer of nuclear chemic and other mean of mass destruct take on a particular danger we cannot help but note the increas in convent arm in the region which undoubt lead to increas militar of the develop countri the effort undertaken by pyongyang to withdraw from the treati on non prolifer of nuclear weapon has evok consider concern in russia and other state of the region in connect with this the nuclear missil ambit of the dprk democrat peopl republ of korea are also caus for concern alarm voic are also resound from tokyo to the effect that in case of appear of nuclear weapon in north korea the tokyo leadership may opt for a review of it defens concept the list of challeng and danger present abov which are an object of concern for the russian leadership invari includ also ecolog secur in order to withstand these challeng and threat togeth with the other state in the region russia is implement a broad complex of measur understand veri well that no one state no matter how mighti it may be can independ solv all the problem which aris here first of all russia leadership proceed from the fact that it arm forc in the far east must serv as a guarantor of stabil and secur and not pose a threat to other state the russian feder is implement this polici by mean of signific reduc the combat conting of the pacif ocean fleet by remov part of it nuclear missil submarin and strateg bomber from combat readi by total liquid the medium and short rang missil locat in the asian part of russia we might add that today not one strateg missil is aim against ani asian state by reduc it militari presenc in the southern island of the kuril ridg up to it total liquid by reduc the level of the militari conting station along the russian chines border and by steadfast meet it oblig under the treati on non prolifer of nuclear weapon as well as the oblig not to be the first to use these weapon the polici on ensur secur is be realiz by russia in the cours of such measur as strengthen and modern convent arm forc with subsequ reduct in their number on the basi of the concept of defens adequaci retain the nuclear potenti at the level provid by the start 2 treati and other agreement prolong the moratorium on nuclear test for one more year if either of the parti doe not renew them first and maintain stabl and multi later relat with other countri in the interest of cooper and secur in the region a model for such posit cooper may be the russian chines talk on demilitar of the common boundari between the two countri as well as the agreement between the rf and the usa on question of secur and disarma the secur of russia is also ensur by the implement of a cours toward polit resolut of crisi situat in the region russia has support the posit of the g 7 at the summit in tokyo which spoke out in favor of creat a negoti mechan of control over the polit resolut of conflict in northeast asia if we conduct a more detail examin of russia strategi in northeast asia from the standpoint of ensur secur and stabil peac and prosper of the entir asia pacif region first of all we must proceed from the fact that the russian feder be a eurasian state expect to have comprehens particip in all the region structur formul for the purpos of ensur the abov mention task in the sub region of northeast asia moreov not in the role of a junior partner as b zanegin maintain but as a state have equal right with the other member we might add that us presid bill clinton in speak of russia role in the asia pacif region call it a great pacif power in order to ensur it strategi in northeast asia russia need intern support of the transform which it is implement moral spiritu and ideolog support moreov moscow is count not so much on financi inject and humanitarian aid as on the regul of larg scale busi cooper and on the remov of all limit on deliveri of high technolog includ from japan in speak of the technolog role of japan within the framework of the region a promin japanes polit and social leader the former prime minist of the land of the rise sun yasuhiro nakason in his work entitl after the cold war emphas that his countri will firm establish itself on the world arena onli after it regul the process of transfer technolog and adopt environment protect measur 3 despit repeat announc by usa presid b clinton to the effect that he will elimin the barrier in trade with russia the approach by particip in the confer of the seven high develop countri of the world g 7 held in tokyo in earli juli of 1993 as note abov turn out to be in the spirit of the cold war in this regard russia might have been abl to make use of the experi of countri in which the process similar to those which are current note in our countri took place or are take place in japan in the 50s 60s in the republ of korea taiwan hong kong singapor malaysia thailand and indonesia in the recent past and up to the present day moscow would not onli like to safeguard it border includ also it far eastern border but would also like to exclud ani outsid intervent in it domest affair russia is not interest in isol it asiat part from the outsid world includ also from the state of northeast asia in compil it plan for develop of the siberian and far eastern region russia is count on the particip of the pacif ocean countri and primarili the state of the northeastern pacif in develop it eastern region in assimil huge natur resourc and in creat the infrastructur necessari for incorpor of this part of russia into the system of econom relat in the asia pacif region we must stress onc again that the entri of the rf into the world communiti presuppos also it equal and not some indirect or secondari particip in all the process take place in the asia pacif region unfortun certain countri of this region and primarili japan fear competit and reduct in it level of influenc are in no way interest in russia presenc here it seem that asid from russia other cis republ have also begun to show an interest in the asia pacif region thus for exampl kazakhstan presid n nazarbayev speak at the 47th session of the un general assembl in the fall of 1992 announc the second aspect which i would like to deal with is the problem of peac and secur on our contin asia and even broader eurasia we are speak of the initi by the republ of kazakhstan on hold a confer on interact and confid build measur in asia svmda 4 accord to nazarbayev this assembl must be transform into a confer on secur and cooper in eurasia by the end of the 20th centuri and at the begin of the 21st centuri it must prepar for the unif of continent system of collect secur for asia europ africa and america into an integr world system of collect secur and cooper howev the real state of affair suggest that this idea is hard realiz in the forese futur most like it will soon be forgotten as was the case with brezhnev idea of collect secur in asia and gorbachev idea of an asiat confer sinc the condit for formul such a system have not yet been creat mani research have point this out for exampl as the chines scientist van guan write in the journal lyaovan despit the general stabil in the asia pacif region and in eastern asia mani countri of the region in the cours of shift in the world situat are introduc correct into their polici and plan and deep chang are current occur in the relat and placement of forc in the region furthermor van conclud that the tendenc toward multi polar will continu to develop in the asia pacif region 5 in turn the veri leadership of the largest asian power the peopl republ of china believ that the occurr of a new world war is unlik in the near futur howev the militari threat has not yet been entir elimin among the factor threaten the secur of china the countri leadership cite primarili the taiwan problem the lack of resolut to question of the disput area along the state boundari primarili with india the conflict over the affili of a number of island in the south china and east china sea the problem of the continent shelf in the marin area border south korea and japan and the possibl of intervent by neighbor state into china domest affair for exampl the direct support of tibet separatist by india a larg part of these problem relat to the sphere of territori disput has deep histor root and bear a long term charact china is strive toward ever more activ particip in the resolut of global and region problem associ with intern secur the countri leadership believ that this task correspond to the greatest degre with such aspect of prc peopl republ of china polici as non particip in ani militari block and allianc absenc of militari base on the territori of other state the oblig not to be the first to use nuclear weapon and not to use them against non nuclear zone and state which do not have nuclear weapon on their territori as well as the uncondit prohibit of chemic and other type of weapon of mass destruct an import place in the plan for ensur region secur belong to china grow initi in the cours toward resurrect good neighbor relat with all the state adjoin it and with the asean associ of southeast asian nation state and other state of the region includ those enter into militari polit allianc base on the principl of self determin and independ of foreign polici as well as it continu grow econom potenti the prc today retain the highest econom growth in the world up to 12 percent per year peke is for the present reject the idea of collect region secur china is undertak the modern of it naval fleet this is quit natur for a sovereign state which up until now has practic not had an ocean fleet at the same time this evok apprehens among it neighbor asiat state by the mid 90s china will have the capabl of place in the open sea naval forc consist of mani ship support by long rang bomber equip with anti ship missil 6 the neighbor are also apprehens about china expand sale of ship launch anti ship missil to thailand in 1990 7 there is an increas real possibl of china becom a larg region forc which may signific influenc the situat not onli in the region of northeast asia but also on a global scale the effort of the dprk to withdraw from the treati on the non prolifer of nuclear weapon and pyongyang nuclear missil ambit have serious complic the problem of secur in asia the preval opinion in the russian mass media is that the principl of collect secur in northeast asia which had begun to be laid down have turn out to be signific undermin the demarch by north korea as krasnaya zvezda affirm has thrust asia into unpreced instabl and strateg indeterminaci 8 in connect with this the supposit was express that the idea of realiz of collect secur in asia seem improb at the present time although these evalu should be view as extrem nevertheless this demarch by pyongyang undoubt has signific hinder polit regul on the korean penninsula as for the usa american scientist and specif jame goodbi a professor at carnegi mellon univers believ that a stabl region system in the asia pacif region which includ the usa china japan the republ of korea the dprk and russia may be base on four primari lead organiz principl hegemoni balanc of forc collect secur and consensus agreement 9 accord to goodbi the current system doe not correspond to ani of the list principl not one of the countri has the appropri potenti and consequ cannot aspir to the role of the predomin hegemon power in the region japan asid from it econom might has no other lever for manifest hegemon ambit the militari econom might of the usa as an attribut of a superpow has not grown into a hegemon power in the region china and russia which are involv in their own domest affair do not aspir to hegemoni while the other power with all their potenti taken togeth cannot act in this role this opinion express by the lead american research is evid close to the truth in ani case mani scientist from the countri of northeast asia believ that the usa which has spoken out quit sharpli on the result of format of the european communiti is dubious about the idea of creat econom and polit associ in the region of northeast asia and has not defin a clear cut attitud toward region associ in the asia pacif region it is quit satisfi with the structur of secur base on bilater agreement which has exist up until the present time and which should be onli slight modifi under the current condit at the same time it remain unclear what role the usa ascrib to russia and china the govern of japan support the posit of the usa in the preserv and partial modif of the american system of secur base on bilater agreement which has exist up until the present time at the same time in the opinion of the japanes academ world there has long been a need for a region allianc for the collect provis of secur as well as for region treati relat in the case of creat a region allianc for the collect provis of secur it is necessari as the japanes research believ to first of all consid the measur for develop relat of true cooper or at least mutual understand without this a recognit of the danger of opposit of militari block cannot be achiev speak more specif contrari to the logic of the power polit which has exist up until the present time individu influenti state from neighbor allianc have ensur effect co exist between each other perhap we should think first of an allianc capabl

structur could be call the asiat hous which would resolv the abov mention problem as japanes research believ 11 mani analyst concur in the opinion that region allianc which do not includ influenti countri may perhap exist at the will of small group which have the power of veto howev they cannot ensur secur in the region with suffici effect perhap asean belong to this type of allianc as it enjoy the patronag of american militari might through the philippin thailand singapor which is one of the reason for it success asean and the asia pacif econom forum apef have perhap the greatest chanc of

the soviet and post soviet period as their membership increas in the futur the expand confer of foreign affair minist of the asean member state present an almost readi made structur for region interact in the asia pacif region capabl of becom the basi for formul of collect secur in northeast asia a uniqu model for the east asiat order was propos by professor yan sun chul of seoul nation univers 12 he call it a model of the fli kite or the eastern asiat regim of collect peac and prosper in the center of such a paper kite is the korean penninsula with the two state locat on it the dkrp and the republ of korea and on the four corner are the cis russia japan china and the usa in the futur it is presum that after unif the central role will be occupi by a unifi korea for the present time the central function could be assum by the republ of korea the korean scientist explain whi specif the republ of korea must occupi the central unifi role cite the follow factor first of all the central organ of the region should not have an aggress potenti or present ani threat in regard to other state which form the structur of the model on this paramet seoul correspond to the stipul condit second the central leadership should not be in conflict with the other four state south korea correspond to these requir the other state at various time in the past and the present have been in conflict relat with each other third the republ of korea may act as a forc of arbitr not onli on problem of secur but also in the econom sphere the countri dynam develop economi allow it to fulfil this function howev the model of the fli kite is hypothet possibl onli if the world doe not follow the path of develop of power polit and it concentr in the hand of the great power if region order is built on such general valu as democraci protect of human right and respect for intern law as well as such institut as the un although this model has receiv the posit review of oppon at the present time it appear utopian a brief analysi of russia nation interest and it approach to the problem of ensur secur in northeast asia show that in develop the foreign polici concept in northeast asia the russian leadership proceed from the assumpt that after the loss of a number of black sea and baltic port and harbor the far east becom the main outpost and maritim gateway of the rf to asia a review

microphon pleas chernukha i have a question for the chairman of the suprem soviet of tajikistan are you satisfi with the document which have been sign today in connect with the protect of your state border my second question i believ that you are oppos to the idea of creat a eurasian union could you explain the reason for your stanc thank you marina chernukha from radio rossii rakhmonov in repli

abdughaniyevich go ahead pleas karimov when the impress is creat that one person put forward an idea and then it is discuss at all forum and peopl are divid into oppon and support i consid that this is not quit correct becaus although the idea of a eurasian union has been put forward it doe not have ani serious foundat and therefor if you ask who is against it we shall repli that we are all in favour but serious thought need to be given to the question of what lie behind it it need to be examin and good ground need to be found becaus as the experi of the exist of the cis show and even the latest initi the creation of an econom union which we are all in agreement with and which we are all move toward in step with one anoth we are make great effort and undertak measur and we have discuss this question frequent at meet of the head of the state even here unfortun not everyth is be resolv and not everyth is so easi to resolv therefor i consid that it would be incorrect to throw asid the

union in general it smack of popul kazakh vice presid yerik asanbayev esteem comrad sinc the idea which nursultan abishevich nazarbayev has put forward is arous such great interest i consid it

cis head of state moreov you know that today there was discuss of the question of prepar the concept and specif mechan for the long term integr develop of the cis i believ that this idea after it has been made more specif will fit into or could well fit into the framework of the instruct which the confer of head of state gave today to the coordin committe to the foreign and defens ministri therefor i think that this an idea which is a logic continu of the process of integr the cis countri and it has not been produc out of thin air i agre that this is a problem which is far from simpl but it has been dictat by life thank you korotchenya thank you microphon number three pleas unidentifi correspond thank you nezavisimaya gazeta i have two question the first is to bori nikolayevich

forc role in georgia what is the opinion on this of the georgian head of state and the second question is to leonid makarovich kravchuk ukrain remain the sole member of the cis that has join the

and csce georgian head of state eduard shevardnadz i agre with what bori nikolayevich yeltsin said well journalist have an idea of what this mean ill quot liter two phrase from that declar which we sign today and which i think has veri consider signific it say here affirm our commit to the earliest solut to the problem of refuge observ of human and nation minor right the principl of the territori integr of the republ of georgia and the secur of statehood for abkhazia the state of the commonwealth of independ state signatori to the treati on collect secur call on the secur council of the unit nation organ to resolv without delay the issu of whether to conduct peacekeep oper in abkhazia that is an appeal to the secur council also the council for collect secur express it willing if for whatev reason a solut is not forthcom in the near futur and time for us is a veri import the decis factor at the moment becaus hundr of thousand of refuge are suffer in accord with the spirit and principl of the treati which is design to ensur the peac and safe develop of the signatori state and with the consent of the parti to the conflict to introduc to the conflict zone peacekeep forc

entir region korotchenya thank you leonid makarovich pleas ukrain presid leonid kravchuk everyon know that the main trend of econom develop within the framework of the cis is integr econom integr this is not happen just within the framework of the cis it is a world wide trend the peopl and the state support this trend of econom integr the form of integr could vari the form adopt by the cis is econom union at the present stage ukrain join the econom union as an associ member but it sign as it did today all the econom document without exept the question is not of integr per se but whether condit and circumst under which this integr is take place are equal in connect with this i should like to return to the question rais here today you see the process take place in the cis are not all the same some countri are get closer togeth other prefer to keep at a certain distanc within this union for exampl the question of merg the monetari system like russia and belarus this is a deeper level of integr than that of the eurasian union if such process go further the eurasian union and the cis will becom unnecessari as there will be no need for them as this is alreadi somewhat broader than econom integr therefor in this situat ukrain is an activ and enterpris particip in the econom union korotchenya thank you microphon number two pleas melnikova anna melnikova of itar tass my first question is to bori nikolayevich today you put forward the concept of further integr within the framework of the cis could you pleas explain what precis this will be will it be just econom integr or

particular view on this do you consid it expedi to have some sort of common approach on this thank you yeltsin we heard inform from the russian foreign minist who is the chairman of the council of

unidentifi speaker three council the defens minist as well yeltsin they and the defens minist yes the council of defens minist they have so far present a document that is i would say rather modest it consist of 10 head which are not satisfactori and do not reflect our entir perspect on integr of cis countri therefor the council of head of state decid to instruct the council of minist for foreign affair of the cis and the council of minist of defens of the cis to draw up a concept for further concentr of integr of the commonwealth countri and befor the next meet submit it for broad discuss by the head of state korotchenya first microphon pleas yakovlev the mir intern televis and radio compani yakovlev we have not yet heard today from the presid of armenia and azerbaijan eduard

aliyev first i did not have a question this is whi i was not answer in respons to the comment by one of the correspond that we are sit in differ place i do not know whi we have been put like this i cannot see ani particular procedur or principl about where we sit we do not have a say in this we sit where they tell us with regard to the conflict or war between armenia and azerbaijan i have recent made an import address about which the journalist should know i spoke about this issu today at the session of the head of state therefor i did not think it was necessari to talk about it here especi now that a statement has been adopt on this question by the head of state howev becaus you are ask i have to answer of cours it is not normal when armenia and azerbaijan two state within the cis are at war with each other this is an abnorm phenomenon that has no preced in the world i think this doe littl for the reput of the commonwealth i spoke about this at our meet in ashkhabad ashgabat on 24 decemb and i was speak about this at the summit today we have discuss it there and as a result a statement on this question was adopt as suggest by the cis chairman russian presid bori nikolayevich yeltsin you have mention the problem of refuge more than 1 million azerbaijan citizen are now refuge live in tent these are not just azerbaijan refuge driven from nagorno karabakh there are also refuge from seven region surround nagorno karabakh the region with a concentr azerbaijan popul which are now occupi by armenian arm format in these region everyth was destroy or plunder and a million peopl have fled to other region of azerbaijan to save their live becaus we do not have a place for them they live in tent which we receiv as part of humanitarian aid from various countri the iranian islam republ has undertaken to provid 100 000 refuge with tent food and cloth the turkish govern has also pledg some help intern arab and other organ also help us of cours all this cannot be normal i have been say it all the time this war has no prospect we should put an end to this war twenti percent of azerbaijan territori is occupi by armenian arm format one cannot agre with this this is not a way of achiev the goal that certain circl are tri to achiev i made appeal on this matter to various head of state and to bori nikolayevich yeltsin i hope that the statement adopt by the head of state today which incident is the first one of it kind in cis histori might help becaus it demand that head of armenia and azerbaijan declar a ceas fire and cessat of all militari action we are readi to stop hostil at ani time we are suffer from aggress the war is be wage on the territori of azerbaijan not armenia peopl are be kill of cours peopl are now be kill in this war on the azerbaijani side and on the armenian side over the past five day armenian arm format have been wage an intens attack azerbaijani are die and armenian are die this cannot be allow in ani event we are do and will continu to do everyth we can to achiev a ceas fire but the condit for this is that armenian arm format must leav occupi azerbaijani territori i hope that this declar by the cis head of state will help us resolv the issu korotchenya thank you geydar aliyevich levon akopovich do you have someth to say ter petrosyan natur befor repli to the specif question i must make one clarif becaus there is a mistak in the word of the question and by the way even in the way the journalist question has been word thing are present as if there are two state within the cis that are at war with each other this is not the case the war is take place between nagorno karabakh and azerbaijan more than ten intern document have been adopt about the nagorno karabakh conflict at the level of the un secur council three resolut three statement approxim a dozen csce document and statement by the ec not one of these document name armenia as a parti to the conflict i reject this categor and with full respons that is the first thing second specif plan exist for settl the nagorno karabakh conflict the csce plan which was accept by armenia and nagorno karabakh and which was reject by azerbaijan there is russia plan which has been accept again by armenia and nagorno karabakh and which is reject by azerbaijan the cis today adopt a declar on this conflict which is a kind of mandat a mandat for the russian plan to resolv the conflict the essenc of the plan is the deploy of cis disengag forc in the conflict zone between azerbaijani and karabakh forc the fate of peac the fate of the refuge the fate of war and peac is in the hand of azerbaijan everyth depend on the polit will of azerbaijan armenia and karabakh are readi liter befor you now at this tabl to sign the agreement that russia has drawn up korotchenya thank you shevardnadz with your permiss i will give a clarif to the question ask it should be born in mind that within a state there could be conflict that can be solv without outsid assist as it were unfortun thing have taken such a turn that from the veri start the abkhaz conflict has acquir an intern natur so to speak this has entail the necessari step taken by the georgian and russian leadership numer agreement and accord on ceas fire and settlement to the conflict regrett they have fail to succeed and these agreement have been violat the question has now taken a veri fundament import the unit nation and the secur council are constant work on the problem and russia posit mediat role can be seen veri clear in my view the fundament statement of our council today to demand onc again that peacekeep forc be introduc paus and if the secur council fail to take an appropri decis on this issu then we have to put thing in order reli on our own forc i see this as a way out of an impass this is what i can say korotchenya thank you the news confer is over but there is time for one last question from microphon three unidentifi correspond ostankino tv i would like howev to hear onc again from the presid who took part at the roundtabl talk today i do not know who will speak out what guarante do they see for today accord precis to be implement what guarante are there ani now not in some vagu futur but today are there ani guarante today do you see them or not yeltsin you see the cis council of head of state is after all not the same as strict factori manag there are no factori director or his deputi where all instruct are compli with here we hold a council and discuss where a collect view is be develop which is not straightforward it is base on a compromis it may suit some member and not suit other so we cannot say that everi decis will be rigor compli with within strict identifi limit this will not happen some decis will be of cours but other decis will not we have simpli to outlin this concord on some decis to agre on this concord and then act joint i believ that the major of decis there were 26 of them adopt by the council of head of state are realist but what is the valu of a decis alon about nagorno karabakh what is it worth how mani year has this war been go on to think that the war will end and a settlement will be found immedi follow our decis and discuss would be naiv there is a vast amount of work ahead for all of us to achiev a peac outcom there we are confid that we will achiev it joint with azerbaijan joint with armenia joint with russia and other cis state the same is true about the georgian abkhaz conflict in other word there are such issu that cannot be solv right away by simpli sign a document there are other issu howev such as for instanc the new provis on the council of defens minist which we have approv there are no problem or question here at all a decis has been made and it will be compli with as well as a

the legisl and execut organ of power will to a larg extent determin not onli russia futur but also whether we will remain plung into crisi or whether a slow and pain recoveri will begin this is the question let us recal that 1992 has gone down in russia histori as the year when mortal rate exceed birth rate for the first time ever in peacetim the situat deterior still further dure the first nine month of 1993 death have alreadi exceed birth by 500 000 the exist and surviv of the nation itself is in jeopardi befor a cure can be start it is necessari to arriv at an accur diagnosi in other word to apprais sober and without prejudic the situat in which the countri find itself to understand the caus of such tragic event it is necessari to abandon the habit of make analysi and apprais fit in with the goal pursu by differ polit parti the interest of the countri and of the peopl as a whole must at long last come to the foreground in deed and not just in word on this basi it will becom possibl to take the path toward accord between differ polit forc after all due to the exist split it is imposs to elabor a correct polici and pool effort to implement a joint program for extric from the crisi the follow must be one of the main principl of state polici at this stage protect of the countri nation interest on the basi of scienc pragmat and nation accord the author collect doe not in ani way claim that the materi it offer is consumm or complet we have attempt to identifi approach toward the solut of problem some of them are onli outlin in the text the import point is that those in whom the right to make decis is vest should be given an opportun to choos from the broadest possibl rang of substanti propos unfortun today there are frequent occas when incorrect and wrong decis are not onli propos but are also adopt with the consequ that the state and societi suffer afterward in order to avoid this it is necessari to encourag by all possibl mean the elabor of various draft and option for polit decis by independ expert and submit them for broad discuss such an approach is especi import when work on the complex problem of the state secur and develop strategi sinc mani import question have hitherto been studi and practic resolv in isol and this has caus and continu to caus enorm harm it would seem for exampl that the correct decis to attain pariti with the nato countri has result in a sharp weaken of econom secur the pursuit of gross indic and the lack of a systemat and intellig concept of the habitat have produc ecolog disast with the most serious impact on the biospher as a result of anthropogen activ chernobyl territori in the far north and virtual all industri region all this was appar undertaken for the sake of the secur of the countri as a whole although it had a negat effect on it let alon the irrat expenditur of vast quantiti of materi resourc look at the latest exampl while talk about convers we have in realiti ruin the militari industri complex withdrawn from the world arm market and are now incur huge foreign currenc loss becaus the market has been captur by the western countri to curb inflat how could anyon object to this but the method use to implement this concept have becom one of the factor paralyz the economi which has led to strike and the shutdown of enterpris with all the ensu consequ neither the presid nor the feder assembl nor the govern nor ani other state organ compris the most compet and experienc peopl could elabor in depth and comprehens consid and adopt substanti decis on question of state secur unless the session of these organ are preced by a thorough scientif elabor of the problem under consider there is also a need for consult with scientif institut and lead scientist and specialist a seri of question also requir intern cooper becaus in our time it is imposs to contain the elabor of secur problem onli within the nation framework histori has prove that it is imposs to achiev secur for the countri and peac and tranquil for it citizen by militari forc alon this is easi to comprehend if the term secur is extrapol to the individu the nation the peopl the state and the intern communiti a nation can achiev tranquil and function normal onli if it is confid that it will not be subject to devast by war and that it will not die out from an aid epidem or as a result of an ecolog crisi that

digest of idea and materi by the corpor creativ collect with most profound respect for our subscrib reader and oppon sign doctor of histor scienc a podberezkin rau corpor presid and academician of the russian academi of natur scienc nation secur russia in 1994 today more than ever befor we need a critic analysi of the path we have travers and a clear object for societi further develop after all we find ourselv at an histor crossroad there is no turn back but we still have to choos the new road within a veri brief period of time the countri has move from one histor period to anoth there has been a radic chang of state structur an end has been put in russia to the previous polit system which was underpin by the cpsus monopoli of power and ideolog a headlong chang is under way in the correl of form of ownership in russia and correspond in the entir system of social interrel there is a grow accumul of interethn contradict within russia and of problem with former ussr republ which are now sovereign state there has been a fundament chang in russia posit in the world communiti and in it mutual relat with foreign state in this context it is necessari to clear defin the current and long term russian nation interest which correspond with the interest of individu citizen and of societi as a whole it is necessari to highlight those on which the veri exist of our state depend in our view the main point today is to prevent the weaken and collaps of the russian state but how is this to be avoid have defin the prioriti it would be expedi to elabor a program of reform in the interest of societi as a whole and not in the interest of individu group this program will obvious be nationwid it must be comrehens realist and pragmat it must not be burden by ani polit bias citizen have the right and even the duti to know what kind of bright futur they are offer how will reform be implement and how long they will take they are fulli entitl not onli to ask question about all this but also to altogeth disagre with the propos program and ultim to demand an account of the govern activ the way to nation accord must be sought on the basi of respect for the individu and each citizen right regardl of parti religi or nation affili what we need today is a govern capabl of find a way out of the crisi onli a program gear to the need of the major of the popul will enjoy the popul support this is also the onli way to achiev the consolid of all progress forc it is necessari to curb inflat restor confid in the rubl and creat a normal function financi state mechan gear to support for produc rather than for dealer how do we propos to begin first to abandon the excess of polit struggl and to strengthen legal law and order and elementari execut disciplin without which ani power is doom to anarchi in other word to strengthen the state second to undertak a seri of measur to improv live condit for the russian feder citizen and primarili for the least well off section pension children the sick and those unabl to work third to uphold russia uniti and it econom and polit independ fourth to reviv russia spiritu potenti the main threat is the weaken of power and statehood ani weaken of ani of the branch of power mean the weaken of power and statehood as a whole it is extrem shortsight to sow the branch on which you are perch it would be much wiser to reciproc strengthen the repres execut and judici branch of power we offer for your attent an analysi of the situat and a packag of measur to strengthen the state section i i preserv of civil peac of an integr and independ russian state 1 preserv of civil peac and accord arm conflict and local war are increas often wage along russia border the fatherland is on the threshold of a war which could begin either on it border or beyond them it has in fact alreadi begun therefor the main task today is to prevent it escal into all out war for this purpos we need primarili nation uniti and accord no matter how the situat in the countri may develop it is impermiss to make the state depend on victori by differ view or polit forc politician and their ambit even the most outstand one come and go but russia live on ani polit victori would turn into defeat if a blow is dealt on statehood and societi slide toward confront it is imposs to achiev stabil and accord in societi unless an end is put to the divis into our and their into correct and guilti there is alreadi widespread use of the terminomoli and methodolog of psycholog warfar which are use dure prepar for the conduct of combat oper against oppon who will have to be sooner or later destroy the divis of citizen into victor and vanquish is a state crime becaus it lead direct to civil war in order to avoid this and halt this movement toward direct confront lead politician should be made to first abandon person parti interest in the conduct of affair and promot state interest to the foreground second to find within themselv the courag to ceas the endless search for enemi and declar the respons and repent of all for the catastroph which has befallen russia our histori show that precis this spiritu moral approach has alway underpin russia extric from crisi in this context it is necessari to impos a direct legisl ban on the propaganda of enmiti equat it with call for civil war and introduc penalti for the public of unverifi inform detriment to the state and to civil peac but without prevent journalist engag in critic base on fact democraci and it principl must becom a mean for strengthen rather than weaken the state not a singl polit forc can or should claim to be absolut correct and consequ to exercis absolut power it is necessari to consolid all forc in societi without divid them into red white brown and so on this approach has prove pernici for our statehood over the last few decad the econom chao today has been compound by interethn conflict the collaps of moral foundat and cultur heritag and final the crisi of polit power instead of a middl class which in all civil societi compris the scientif technic and creativ intelligentsia skill worker and entrepreneur we have creat a minut privileg stratum of dealer while the remain strata are undergo headlong lumpen at no time and in no place has this path ever creat a reliabl support for democraci and state power in societi it is paradox but for mani year on end the state has pursu an antist polici aim at the disintegr and elimin of it most import institut the armi nation domest polici and the state secur system the most acut problem face the state today are a to prevent a civil war b to strengthen the state institut c to prevent russia collaps d to overcom the socioeconom crisi and save the nation e to preserv scienc cultur and educ cadr pose an especi acut problem when promot peopl to the lever of state administr societi envisag a system of measur to train administr cadr all over the world includ prerevolutionari russia ani citizen who wish to becom a profession politician has to go through the school of upbring educ and practic befor he is allow access to polit activ in local organ of power in order to be launch into state level orbit the candid has to climb a long ladder of practic work and train in the unit state befor a citizen can hold promin offic he is polish in a prestigi univers and in the cours of work abroad in the ministri includ the state depart and the cia or parti apparatus in congress and so on the result is a skill functionari meet the need of his societi rule circl but even here mistak cannot be avoid the polar of polit forc and their grow confront take the most uncivil form in russia not onli did not end with the elimin of the russian feder suprem soviet but are actual intensifi the elect campaign consider stimul this process consequ it is probabl that one section of the rule elit will succeed in crystal into a clear defin parti structur which will attempt to establish control first over the govern and then over the presid de facto reviv the one parti polit system the access of such a parti to power will in turn inevit lead first to a clash between the presid and the feder assembl and then to a leadership struggl within the rule parti itself unfortun the histori of the ussr and the cpsu offer us numer tragic exampl of such develop of event in this context from the state point of view there is need for measur for legisl and polit regul of parti activ make provis for temporari suspens of the activ of all parti and sociopolit organ in the event that the natur of their polit activ becom damag to the state secur this kind of decis and this is of fundament import must be made and monitor by the suprem organ of state power subject to one immut condit polit decis must under no circumst becom the prerog of execut and monitor organ like the mvd ministri of intern affair the ministri of secur the prosecutor offic and so on in our view the ideal author to make such decis would be the judiciari the real strengthen of the aithor and potenti of the judiciari must becom a prioriti task in russia state build base our analysi on the suprem interest of the state and the nation we have conclud that firm author is need today the most effect indisput and bloodless form for russia could be an interim presidenti rule monitor by the feder assembl if we were to leav asid polit bias and the ambit of polit leader and forc desir to make capit out of discord in russia we are confid that mani of our fellow citizen would agre even an imperfect leader of the nation is better than a group of polit leader look primarili after their own interest and corrupt element strain to come to power dure the most difficult time in russia histori feudal strife invas the time of troubl the countri emerg victori have mobil all it resourc and the spiritu potenti of the mass under a singl leader leadership the soviet era was no except see that stalin dictatorship was object a posit factor of victori in world war ii and of the countri reemerg from the ruin the press occasion write that russia today feel not onli the urgent need but even the inevit of the appear of an authoritarian regim capabl of extric the countri from the crisi some peopl assum that russia has alreadi taken this path and therefor the question is not how to avoid a transit to authoritarian but to choos it most accept form and the method for transit we it is said have alreadi diverg from the possibl form and norm of a develop democrat state in the transit period it is therefor necessari to accept this fact as an object exist realiti and second to tri and find a method peac and the one most accept for the state of transit to one of the more prefer form of authoritarian this assum that new qualiti will be demand of the repres of the authoritarian form of rule leader of the nation rather than of a parti staunch defend of the state and it interest rather than leader of reform a builder rather than a destroy in other word a major revis of the prioriti and valu which have been domin in the last few year the list of these charact qualiti could be logic extend to includ a serious chang in the disposit of polit forc the transform of recent alli and friend into polit oppon and the obvers the attract of broad strata of profession and specialist not commit to ani one polit parti or movement it may happen that instead of authoritarian we could end up with incess struggl intrigu by differ group parti and junta and attempt coup with the state and the nation at stake ani such struggl which has becom an accept form of exist for these leader and a part of their essenc will inevit and for a long time to come hinder and delay the stabil of the situat in the countri and will weaken our might the countri earliest possibl extric from the crisi and the gradual format of durabl democrat foundat of a civil societi are import for russia becaus real democraci is possibl onli in a societi where there are no mortal threat against the state and the nation 2 improv of the feder structur prevent of region fragment what should russia be like follow the disappear of the superpow the soviet union from the world map it former constitut call it the russian feder but is this realli true a genuin feder is possibl onli when two or sever state are unit and as a rule it is base on last integr without the right to seced the autonomi of a union state compon is guarante insofar as it doe not threaten the state uniti precis this principl was use in form the major of feder state exist today the unit state switzerland canada germani true enough some other state also style themselv as feder argentina brazil mexico venezuela india and spain for exampl essenti howev they are unitari state with a certain amount of autonomi for their provinc pseudofeder in the classic sens of the word world experi has shown that a durabl feder state is possibl onli when it is form by autonom state keen to unit by dint of various vital import reason more recent histor exampl alreadi prove that ani attempt to creat a feder out of immatur nation and territori format inevit engend instabl and disintegr which swift lead to the collaps of newli form state or the format of a unitari state the soviet union was a feder onli in name proclaim by it constitut but in essenc was in our view a typic pseudofeder it is well known that a treati between a seri of republ was conclud in 1922 but in the strict jurid and legal sens not a singl one of the compon agre to the union was a state as for the rsfsr russian soviet feder socialist republ as one of the contract parti to the creation of the ussr from the veri begin it was also a pseudofeder both in form and in it inner composit the conclus of the feder treati in it present form did not solv the problem either with whom did the feder compon conclud the treati with the feder state structur to be precis if they repres a singl state it emerg that the russian it numer largest peopl compris more than 80 percent of the popul are dispers among the feder compon sinc their own statehood is not even mention furthermor tatarstan and the chechen republ did not sign the feder treati while the stanc of a seri of republ and region as regard the distribut of power is threaten the russian feder uniti it is fair to ask is the newli emerg russia not a wors variat of the same old pseudofeder it has to be object note that ever sinc the collaps of the russian empir the ethnic russian have been gradual lose their statehood this is the fundament question of our communiti develop in view of all that has been said abov will russia be abl to becom a genuin feder state the fatherland histori contain sever exampl of attempt to impos a feder unif of territori dure the kievan period right until the invas by the golden hord dure the suzdal muscovi period dure the time of troubl and in 1917 right after the februari revolut it is of cours possibl today to blame the soviet power for fail to take everyth into consider when form the sovereign republ but the main point is that mani peopl acquir or restor their statehood precis thank to the soviet power the pull toward integr and uniti of the peopl of both russia and the former ussr stem from numer factor the territori which they inhabit eurasia throughout the mani centuri of their exist these peopl have on mani occas unit within state format and have produc uniqu cultur and singl spiritu area they perceiv eurasia as their motherland contin whose fate is insepar from the fate of each one of it peopl experi show that whenev the eurasian ethnic group have fail to reach accord their land have becom easi prey for aggressor the struggl for eurasia repartit could disrupt the world geopolit equilibrium and caus a global catastroph anoth common featur of russia peopl is the high polyetnn natur of all newli form state onli six of the multitud of russian peopl claim more than 50 percent of indigen popul in their republ the chuvash account for 69 percent the tuvinian for 64 percent the komi permyak for 60 percent the chechen for 58 percent the buryat in aga buryat autonom okrug for 54 percent and the ossetian for 53 percent the averag indigen popul in all russian feder republ is 32 percent and even less 10 5 percent in autonom okrug it is simpli imposs to divid all this into some sort of state format the follow conclus suggest itself russia peopl are destin to live in one state feder in spirit and form so what are the way to solv the nation state question in russia there are two main danger appar in the possibl develop of nation process today the first is the uncontrol explos of russian nation as a natur defens reaction to the threat of russia fragment and to the insult of nation digniti take the form of the russophobia and chauvin typic of some former union republ and of individu nation region in russia itself but the establish of nationalist dictatorship is no solut the lament experi of such dictatorship and regim in a seri of state which emerg on the territori of the ussr offer convinc proof of this territori and state collaps is as a rule the price that has to be paid for the triumph of nation idea the second danger lie in the attempt to turn russia back to it prerevolut state structur divid it into guberniya in practic term this would mean the forc colon of nation republ the right which non russian peopl have acquir can no longer be withdrawn or curtail without tragic consequ for them and for the russian nation russian or ani other nation will not onli lead inevit to the destruct of russia integr but will also render the statehood of these veri peopl just a pipedream the ideal way to a genuin feder state is to conclud a full blood feder treati between the republ russia kray and oblast as feder compon must enjoy equal right with the republ with a possibl subsequ establish of new integr format guberniya laender the more extens the level of self govern the more last will be the real integr between feder compon includ the russian region the comprehensivess of this integr elimin the problem of the russian nation possibl self dismember in the event that kray and oblast are elev to the level of republ thus feder could be found simultan on the nation state nation territori and territori principl which would be most in line with russia specif featur there is need to constitut enshrin the right of nation group and the guarante of cultur autonomi in this process it will be import to sensibl distribut power between central and local organ of power and administr sinc the two organ of power parliament and govern combin all the origin featur of a multin state in the person of deputi and member of the govern they would appear to personifi to a larg extent the compon of the feder and their peopl and then the center authoritarian within the limit of it power would be accept with understand on the other hand authoritarian in the form of a presidenti republ in russia specif condit could spark off conflict which would be diffitul to overcom and in the event of the adopt of decis which may be disadvantag for some of it compon it may even prompt nation agit and protest nonetheless experi show that at critic moment in histori authoritarian as a temporari measur may be necessari and furthermor justifi the format of a genuin feder russian state will offer an opportun to reviv the larg lost tie with nearbi foreign countri the time and extent of this new rapproch of peopl from the former ussr will depend primarili on russia stabil and prosper this will happen sooner or later and when it doe the eurasian contin will see the emerg of a new communiti of free peopl and state qualit differ from all other in the past main due to the genuin feder principl underpin it build if oblast even enlarg one ural republ far east republ and so on were to be given the right to have their own parliament constitut embassi and so on this would run contrari to both intern experi and common sens ani sovereign of administr oblast in today condit will lead to the feder transform into a confeder in light of the current weaken of power this would be the quickest way to the state collaps with all the ensu econom and social consequ which would be extrem serious for all evid of this can be seen in the consequ of the soviet union collaps a strengthen of separat is also possibl even if compon do not formal seced from the feder someth which can alreadi be notic today what attitud should be taken toward the strive of the leadership of some sovereign republ to take advantag of the feder state weaken so as to expand their right still further and acquir a special status in the feder someth like associ member practic has convinc confirm that ani excess expans of compon right lead to a weaken and even the collaps of the feder case of secess from the feder by joint accord of all interest side are isol the state of singapor from malaysia other attempt secess have usual been put down by forc the sonderbund in switzerland the southern state in the unit state biafra in nigeria and so on and even if they did succeed on occas this was the result of militari oper against the feder the separ of bangladesh from pakistan in 1970 natur this way to preserv the state uniti is unaccept to us the state laender or provinc compris feder abroad usual exercis onli the right which have been either vest in them by the central power or enshrin in the constitut on the basi of agreement between the compon there is a tendenc toward curtail the scope of these right they do not enjoy independ in intern affair there are numer instanc when decis by the suprem court of such feder direct indic that their compon are not sovereign canada australia in nigeria and with a view to block ani ethnic separat the state territori has been reshap in such a way as to give them a nation heterogen popul mix neither the constitut nor the feder treati of the russian feder make provis for the compon right to seced from the feder and self determin is exercis within the framework of a feder state which is not bound to uncondit grant to a republ popul the right to separ even if such a demand has been back by the major of the popul in a referendum ani such referendum is unlaw and it result can have onli a polit not a legal signific the threat to seced from the feder which can be heard everi now and again run contrari to both the constitut and the feder treati therefor they have no legal effect and in our view ought to be resolut cut short bear in mind the vast advantag which the republ have alreadi gain thank to their membership of the russian feder their leader ought to abandon their attempt to further expand their right to the point which is tantamount to secess while the legitim right of republ and oblast ought to be cover by addit treati with the feder the forc of law is better than the law of forc the law enabl it use the extent of feder compon right is determin not through barter or some sort of deal result in their curtail or expans it is clear predetermin by the demand stem from the principl of self determin it is impermiss to expand the right of compon at the expens of the interest of other nation and all peopl of the feder which also enjoy these right the principl of self determin protect the interest of all peopl and curb nation egot this is precis whi it remain the basi of nation polici both in the russian feder and in the world communiti life has prove that ani reject of the feder on a nation basi is in our countri at least imposs today further advanc toward the feder can take the form of more effect protect of individu nation right educ of peopl in a spirit of cooper and solidar use of two or even three offici languag the strengthen of legal and so on 3 elimin of the seat of interethn conflict the present status of interethn relat in the russian feder

reshap the exist ethnopolit area it is obvious that this develop lead to disintegr of all polit social and technolog tie contemporari yugoslavia is an exampl the second model is associ with the reintegr of totalitarian this violent way of deal with the nation problem can take the form of militari nationalist regim ethnojunta the most negat consequ would stem from the establish in russia of a nationalist regim with the ensu restor of a neo imperi system throughout the geopolit area the third model is the sole peac altern presuppos a democrat develop ethnic tension is eas through the build of feder state in a seri of former union republ on a democrat rather than a nation basi in this process tie between the independ republ could be built accord to the model of permeabl and toler sovereignti the desir to prevent an econom collaps in post soviet state and a complet break of technolog tie between them and to eas pressur by the russian factor in former union republ will intensifi in the face of the threat that nationalist regim may be establish it would be possibl within the third model framework to halt the catastroph disintegr of the union econom area and to prevent the violent arm dismember of the singl ethnic area on the territori of the former ussr in our view it is from these posit that the russian state posit on the question of the russian diaspora in nearbi foreign countri must be elabor the ussr disintegr has shift the russian nation problem onto a new plane in the imperi union the russian play the role of the ethnic integr compon of union statehood at the same time an expans of the russian ethnic habitat occur within that state framework more than 50 percent of migrat flow in the ussr involv the movement of person of russian nation for the first

come up against intoler and extrem bloodi war accompani by thousand of victim are rage in differ part of the former soviet union it can hard be expect that peac prosper and tranquil will come to russia or the other nis in 1994 thus accord to data of the us depart of defens defens intellig servic there are forecast of 12 potenti arm conflict on the territori of the former ussr it is estim that

that of their famili and friend is becom an increas topic problem for russian wherea this problem worri 31 percent of muscovit in may 1993 this figur had alreadi risen to 42 percent in septemb the economi is aggrav the situat and it is still hard to expect ani swift and major chang for the better here inde accord to imf data virtual all basic indic in the nis had declin by an averag of one fourth in comparison with 1989 1990 while consum price increas 1 284 6 percent in 1992 in 1993 the volum of gdp will declin by 13 7 percent and price will increas by 940 6 percent in russia gdp declin

academi of scienc nation econom forecast institut the restor of the protect and reproduct function for russian is the sovereign state basic task in what form should these function be restor on a new basi on the basi of democraci and market relat howev commit to democraci and market relat by itself is not a state idea which can unit multin russia in a unifi state the birth of specif method of transform just like of a state idea is pain nowaday have to fight through the complex of the past and the contradict of the present the basic criteria in this process could be the minim of social loss the spiritu humanist and moral orient of transform and the balanc of the interest of the world communiti and of the russian feder peopl today just like in 1991 russia is face the task of how to realli becom sovereign an analysi of the past two year show increas clear that not a singl one of the nis includ russia was prepar either polit or econom or psycholog for sovereign exist the end of 1991 saw the format of 15 protost without border armi monetari system infrastructur state or nation interest full blood economi and so on it ought to be conclud that even today not a singl one of these state is full blood in this sens consequ in 1994 just as in the two preced year their develop will be determin by the follow block of problem a complet the format of sovereign state with all state attribut b creat an effect system of mutual relat between the nis c join the polit militari econom and other system exist in the world open presuppos meet the other state halfway establish new mutual relat with them and expand the sphere of these relat convers sovereign of each nis and it separ from the union would mean draw away from it former neighbor in the communal state a certain step up of autarki breakdown of exist tie and alien this contradict determin the logic of mutual relat between the nis which develop in two opposit direct first there was an increas notic manifest of interst relat establish of custom regim and border most republ the baltic countri ukrain kyrgyzstan moldova georgia azerbaijan belarus kazakhstan are introduc either nation currenc or ersatz money on the basi of autonom emiss the financi system is be structur balanc of payment and trade are be determin the former ussr foreign debt asset and liabil are be divid debt account is be establish and so on second integr feel are grow or at least the desir for an earli break is weaken in most former republ except latvia and estonia and part lithuania and turkmenistan nonetheless today it is still prematur to talk of integr or disintegr what we are observ for the time be is the coexist not of the nis but of real author at differ level in these nis for exampl how is it possibl to treat as part of russian kazakhstani relat the tripartit polit econom union of kazakhstan tatarstan and bashkortostan which was sign in august 1992 and under which bashkortostan ceas deliv oil product to russian depart in 1994 it will be necessari either to make effort to place russia relat with the nis on the firm basi of intern law or to creat suprast structur with power of author it is more than like that both form will develop in the immedi futur the format of civil relat between the nis will be influenc by the follow factor the incomplet disintegr of the ussr as a result of which the subject of interst relat have not been final defin it is possibl that their number may be either increas if separat intensifi in russia moldova georgia ukrain and so on or reduc if the process of integr are intensifi two fundament differ principl are clear manifest the nation territori separ into autonom republ and nation territori format and the region separ into pure russian region analysi show that the russian feder disintegr will hard end up as a sovereignti bandwagon of autonom format the indigen etnnic group repres even a relat major in onli 11 out of the 31 nation territori format separatist mood are intensifi in proper russian region in the far east the ural kuban siberia this has not been observ either in the nis or in east european countri the follow forecast can be made for 1994 retent of an economi with a price structur out of kilter with world price in 1993 russia suppli product to the nis at price equival to 30 40 percent of world price while purchas from them at price equival to 70 percent of world price and consequ russia had a posit balanc of about 750 billion rubl in trade with the nis in the first six month deterior of the situat of etnnic russian in the nis have becom an ethnic minor there the situat is be aggrav by the fact that virtual all the nis be multin have opt for the nationalist idea in strengthen the state lukewarm attitud of the world communiti primarili of the g 7 countri toward individu nis and the structur of mutual relat prevail in the post soviet area it ought to be note in this context that first in 1992 1993 the major of nis lost their illus about western aid but certain hope remain that some would be integr within the ec while other would draw closer to asian countri and would enjoy their support second there is a steadili grow econom depend on the west and third there is an increas clear manifest tendenc by the west to pursu main it own interest in relat with the nis for exampl squeez russia out of the arm market and other technolog market increas purchas of energi sourc from russia at the expens of deliveri to nearbi foreign countri and so on sever system of collabor between the nis will be form in 1994 in one way or anoth prioriti is be given to the problem of structur the geopolit area with the aim of boost stabil in the region and the manag of polit process 5 way to form a civil societi term like civil societi and citizen have been increas activ use in our vocabulari recent wherea in the past these term were virtual unencount in the mass media and the word citizen was use primarili by law enforc organ at best it was taken to mean the jurid unit of the state system civil societi becam the topic of studi back in the late 17th and earli 18th centuri in the work of hobb lock and hegel these thinker perceiv the possibl of a relat autonom social life exist outsid state control there are two approach toward the civil societi in world scienc today 1 as a packag of social relat counterpos to the state in other word everyth that cannot proper be describ as state power polit and bureaucraci 2 as a form of exist for a bourgeoi market democrat societi we support the first approach civil societi is a system

this process will be extrem protract and veri pain these are the condit of a civil societi vital activ all it member must own specif properti and the right to util it and dispos of it as they see fit thus the foundat could be provid by privat which will lead to the creation of self organ structur of small and medium busi independ of the state the exist of a develop and rich social structur reflect the divers of the interest of differ group and strata life has confirm that poverti and an undevelop social structur have alway provid a breed ground for dictatori regim the social base of a civil

high skill worker and some worker from the servic sphere the middl stratum in develop countri compris 60 70 percent of the popul it is the middl stratum which not onli ensur scientif and technic

countri the build of a democrat societi presuppos the narrow of the sphere of state regul of citizen vital activ rather than the opposit civil societi is the suprem stage and most modern form of human communiti progress is associ with the wither away of the state with it be absorb within a civil societi 6 the status of crime and russia secur it is no accid that these two idea have been juxtapos for a long time the concept of the struggl against crime in the countri was offici built upon the wither away of crimin phenomena dure the process of socialist and communist build the struggl against it was assign main to law enforc organ in other word it was base on repress crimin law method the prevent of crime which was discuss at such length was never proper launch this soft approach toward crime as a phenomenon without ani deep econom and sociopolit root onli drove the problem deeper the law enforc organ were forc to manipul statist by artifici inflat or deflat the real indic crime in russia reach an unpreced scale in 1992 about 28 million crime were commit and this figur includ a more than 40 percent rise in the number of premedit murder and an increas in the number of assault and robberi by a factor of 16 the number of crime per 100 000 member of the popul increas from 1 467 to 1 857 in other word an increas by virtual one third this trend persist also in 1993 but the number of record crime hard reflect the true pictur accord to some expert estim recent there have been some 10 12 million crime commit in russia each year the statist do not includ 80 percent of embezzl case 90 percent of fraud case and the overwhelm number of rape case some 352 000 person have been kill or maim by crimin dure the last four year more than 172 000 person have been kill in road traffic accid and fire these figur are compar onli with war casualti the crimin world is becom more profession and is acquir modern technolog and weapon the rise crime pose a real threat to nation secur and the polici of implement of reform it is perfect obvious that crime like a mirror reflect the general condit of our societi and primarili of it foundat the economi organ crime is becom a special danger for societi in the period of polit and econom chang in the countri the russian mafia is becom more cruel and more brazen than it counterpart abroad more than 4 000 origan crimin communiti have been expos in russia includ over 1 000 with intern and interregion link one out of everi four group is protect by corrupt functionari in differ structur accord to expert estim these relat involv up to 40 percent of entrrepreneur and two third of all commerci structur so far the effort to combat this grow threat have fail to produc ani tangibl result this threat has not even been legisl defin therefor we feel that the best possibl definit is contain in the un secretari general report a organ crime is the activ of associ or crimin individu or group unit on an econom basi these group are high reminisc of gang dure the feudal era which exist in mediev europ prior to the emerg of the state econom benefit are gain by the suppli of illeg servic and good or of legal servic and good use illeg method b organ crime presuppos conspiratori crimin activ an hierarchi of structur and coordin of the plan and execut of illeg act c organ crimin group strive to establish a monopoli or an almost complet monopoli on the suppli of illeg good and servic to consum d organ crime is not limit just to pursuit of obvious illeg activ or the suppli of illeg servic it also includ sophist type of activ like money launder via legitim econom structur and manipul effect with the help of electron mean illeg crimin group infiltr mani profit legitim type of activ e the crimin organ within group use cruel method like threat violenc and corrupt these method can be either sophist and refin or convers gross direct and blatant they are use to gain econom benefit through the establish of monopoli on the suppli of illeg good and servic or by infiltr legitim type of activ and corrupt offici thus whenev person involv in organ crimin activ start engag in legitim commerci activ they normal bring into it the method of violenc and intimid there is an expans of crimin organ in russia and this is precondit primarili by the growth of sociopolit instabl and the weaken of state structur in the countri at a time when the new democrat institut are still weak the new categori of crimin activ includ the illeg sale of weapon in condit of instabl both in russia and in nearbi foreign countri the volum of illeg weapon sale has increas also as a result of ethnic and nationalist outburst northern caucasus georgia azerbaijan tajikistan the theft of and trade in stolen car the theft of cargo carri by railroad and motor vehicl transport the embezzl and illeg export of histor and cultur valuabl crime commit with the help of electron mean fraud associ with credit card and other financi document the illeg dispos of danger wast the trade in human organ the launder of illeg earn money the embezzl and illeg export of raw materi energi sourc and rare earth and nonferr metal the larg scale product of and trade in drug insur fraud money forgeri smuggl fraudul bankruptci accord to expert estim the illeg circul of drug in the countri amount to 50 60 billion rubl a year while more than 15 million russian citizen regular use drug for nonmed purpos an intens process of fuse general crimin activ and econom crime drug traffick and corrupt is under way in the countri there is no doubt that the negat effect of organ crime on our societi is grow and affect all it structur at individu collect and state level be a cynic form of lawless which malici violat citizen right and constitut guarante in this context a special danger is pose by corrupt and it consequ the take of illeg advantag of state offic to gain person benefit is a breed ground for crimin group whose leader consid the payment of sundri bribe to offici as one form of invest their fund we have at present a fine tune system of briberi in the credit financ sphere the trade network transport and the organ engag in foreign econom activ licens and privat go briberi rate have been establish for alloc of land parcel reregistr of enterpris evas of militari servic assist in conceal revenu from taxat avoid of custom regul with impun and other illeg oper therefor the corrupt of offici from law enforc organ and other state institut engend among the public profound mistrust in the author and undermin peopl faith in the law and the state organ crime is manifest a grow desir to infiltr the countri economi argument have been heard recent claim that the invest of illeg earn fund in the legitim economi would help it stabil but this is noth but a myth world experi show that organ crimin activ destabil all econom sphere and disrupt the natur effect of market forc the revenu of organ crimin group are suffuci high but these fund are withdrawn from normal circul all this give urgenc to the elabor of specif long term measur to combat organ crime crimin group continu to activ penetr societi social and polit life while pursu their object they are now influenc both elect campaign and the legisl process by corrupt politician and offici organ crimin group are also tri to extend their influenc on the mass media thus a process of organ crime evolut into an antisoci system claim leadership in the economi and in polit is now under way in russia some conclus the uncheck spread of crime in our countri is a consequ of the overal weaken of the state and it power structur the solut of this problem is a statewid task wherebi the actual plan of struggl against crime must becom part of a program for strengthen and develop the russian state base on nationwid accord of cours the specif activ to curb and uproot crime must be conduct and improv in parallel with all measur to strengthen russian statehood but must be implement much faster and more effici there must be no delay in elabor and implement this plan the present condit in russia and the cis countri are creat a situat which is uniqu in human histori and typic onli of the former ussr republ in the light of the specif econom and polit aspect of their histori the contemporari period of transit and the futur prospect organ crime and corrupt are most danger by dint of their destruct long term consequ for the individu societi and the state the accumul of vast wealth by individu and clan in the world of organ crime inevit lead to the need to polit protect their interest henc the desir to control power in the state bribe high rank offici and promot the recipi of bribe to higher posit russia and the cis countri are experienc a multipl of establish crimin communiti which either have or are in the process of establish a financi base for the attain of their goal major arsenal of weapon hierarch structur far reach conspiraci and rigid disciplin with vertic subordin and the use of terror even includ the physic elmin of peopl organ crime reli on general crimin activ and corrupt is begin to permeat all cell of societi and the state organ extend to vital import center and sphere the economi financ scienc and technolog cultur the arm forc and so on therefor the plan for struggl against crime must be specif gear without overlook a singl one of these sphere organ crime recogn no border it is increas becom not onli interregion but also transnat and therefor the struggl against it requir the pool of the world communiti effort the primari task is to creat a firm legisl basi enforc respect for the law and ensur the law implement by all citizen social associ and state structur primarili by the law enforc organ themselv for this purpos it is necessari to adopt the most radic measur even though they may be unpopular russian will support them if they perceiv that this is not just anoth campaign but a state polici which realli ensur the secur of the individu and societi section ii ii format of genuin spiritu principl and valu of the russian peopl 1 need for a nation idea dure the most critic period of our fatherland histori the nation has been save thank to the vast reserv of the russian peopl spiritu strength a most import role here is play by the russian idea the russian idea compris primarili orthodox spiritu which is distinguish by it refus to ration faith and it accept of god with the soul with love and with a selfless percept of beauti it is underpin by the concept of conciliar sobornost as the unif of peopl for the sake of the orthodox faith reviv and the fatherland prosper the russian peopl commit to the idea of statehood is histor establish onli the moral author of state power is capabl of contain the anarch quest for the kingdom of truth within the confin of the evolutionari path anoth key aspect of the russian idea is the univers of the russian nation charact in other word it toler for and accept of other idea and tradit it abil to coexist with neighbor peopl in all probabl this qualiti is exploit more than ani other by those who would like to dilut the univers love for one neighbor into abstract univers human valu there has been a long press need to start talk about statehood on a state level by dint of it uniqu geopolit situat russia has an opportun to take it proper posit in the communiti of the 21st centuri and turn into a realli high develop world power one of the mistak of our govern the presid and his entourag is the fact that they hard ever discuss this with the peopl the nation must regain it digniti clear perceiv it histor prospect and acquir confid in it futur and it own strength it is necessari for the idea of statehood to becom state ideolog and polit practic and ultim state polici all citizen state institut and branch of power must support the idea of statehood by all possibl mean the great russian philosoph vl solovyev emphas individu human be and entir nation alik face the task of complement each other without lose their origin but on the contrari express it to the utmost the true uniti of peopl is not homogen but pannat spirit in other word interact and solidar by all for autonom and full life by all these are truli sacr word call for uniti everyth that has happen over the last few year is at time reminisc of the flight of troop abandon behind them to the vagari of fate 25 million captiv russian and russian speak compatriot who have sudden found themselv in alien countri nowaday dub nearbi foreign countri now draw parallel with the ussr russia itself is alreadi at break point the question of it integr and it futur face us with utmost urgenc there are quit a few time bomb along the path which russia has taken the unequ status of peopl without their own statehood and primarili the russian peopl the centrifug tendenc stem from the nation econom separat of some feder compon the growth of religi nationalist separat administr border are be reshap at the will of irrespons politician and are acquir the status of state border which histori and the peopl will hard accept scientist and politician ponder these problem today singl out sever path and sever model of develop they includ dictatorship on an imperi scale the emerg of numer ethnojunta and enclav spontan or artifici provok outburst of russian nation lead to the reviv of uniti by forc and uproot all separatist tendenc militari intervent by other state artifici creation of a separ russian republ and enforc colon of the etnnic group and nation inhabit the countri territori and yet some time ago the russian thinker i ilin warn those who would dismemb russia dream that after the bolshevik fall the citizen of unit russia will again slide into chao and anarchi will decompos their state with impun and with total disregard for everyth will set up as mani new statelet as they fanci each one of these new format have it own armi currenc and diplomaci this is whi they want to see the russian nation group discard the exist of a singl russian peopl and state and take advantag of the postbolshevik chao bring about univers arbitrari and collaps they dream of turn russia into a multipl of piti and strateg impot pigmi thus leav it open to conquest and enslav by western and southeastern state the guid idea of pannat spirit unifi reconcil extrem along russian line and creat condit for peac democrat develop can lead to russia deliver reviv and futur prosper one of the main obstacl in our view is the fact that today nation state structur of the russian feder doe not guarante the

regardless of race color sex languag religion polit or other belief nation or social origin and class or other status this should be the basi when form the structur of a state system guarante equal for all russian a breakup of the russian ethno is now under way or rather it violent split with the format in former union and autonom republ of russian nation minor at time account for up to 50 percent of the popul and this in itself is alreadi fraught with catastroiph conflict ani attempt to concentr in russian communiti the million of peopl who have end up as refuge in their own countri or

scientif avenu which are a matter of nation and worldwid pride at the same time there has been a sharp deterior in the alreadi inadequ provis of materi and technic backup for scienc in this regard we have alway lag behind industri develop countri and while scienc in the west was retool the lag from which we suffer has turn into a gap which is difficult to close by the late 1980s the fix asset of

the general crisi in russia scienc the econom declin in 1991 1993 has virtual elimin our countri instrument make it has prove to be unprofit there is no foreign currenc to purchas import instrument the inform backup for scienc can be said to be at almost zero level and russia scientist appear to be cut off from the world data bank more than two third of poll leader and associ of lead academ

the cultur problem is far broader than the problem of the present polit power of econom reform and of state reorgan the nation must find the strength and method to comprehend and resolv it regardless of what the author might do especi sinc cultur is more viabl than all polit regim ideolog and state it is a question onli of the price and method of cultur self preserv as a condit for the nation

the past and bring the fatherland cultur back to the mainstream of world develop soon enough took a special path again this has prove to be the path of level the fatherland cultur polit has onc again stealthili and on the quiet assum the function of cultur decid onc again on the latter behalf what from the past is suitabl for the civil societi model and what has to be excis cauter and ridicul the

doe not in ani way guarante the flourish of creativ nowaday mani peopl repeat the old truism poverti is the worst form of slaveri creativ peopl are becom hostag of commerci the naiv polit faith of mani intellectu in politician has prove fatal how mani notabl figur are now silent have been traumat by the fact that they perceiv as beacon some politician who prove to be noth but decept will o the wisp at the same time in a situat wherebi we are more than like not onli to experi a buildup of catastroph tension in all sphere of societi life but also to see the peopl driven into apathi and listless right up to the point where the desir and actual will to live are dull and societi is paralyz becaus noth is sacr and mandatori for peopl in this situat we are begin to see the emerg of a stratum of peopl with the qualiti and function of a new intelligentsia the intelligentsia is not affili to ani polit stream it doe not serv either the state or the parti or the church or even the peopl intellig as a human qualiti doe not speak on anyon behalf but it own base on the theoret principl of knowledg the theoret natur of the new intelligentsia judgment doe not at all mean that it is aloof from the realiti of life now for exampl it cannot adopt an indiffer attitud toward the russian govern in this regard the intelligentsia doe not fit anywher within the rang of viewpoint held by various polit group and various social strata of the popul from a sounder point of view it can be seen that a chang of govern and of author in general will inevit result in replac the immatur inconsist at time simpli foolish and clumsi democraci but democraci nonetheless with a quasi democraci this is the ground on which intellectu determin their attitud toward the govern today but from the fundament posit the present situat call more for understand rather than for approv or condemn to comprehend and to announc it conclus to societi this is the function of the new intelligentsia politician intellectu parti and movement want success a member of the intelligentsia want the truth by it veri natur the new intelligentsia need more than anyth els the fullest possibl democraci and it is the one that can util it best of all this mean that it is capabl of be a kind of regul of the degre and form of democraci the new intelligentsia is also the bearer of optim in a societi of

statehood is just one centuri older than the russian orthodox church if we take as our start point the date when christian was adopt as the state religion of rus by kievan grand princ vladimir in ad 988 nonetheless it was this step that larg promot the caus of russian state build simultan with christian rus also adopt byzantin law which had incorpor all the best point of roman law which had been further fecund by the church conciliarist experi over the centuri the state import of the church for rus dure the kievan period of it histori was larg determin by the fact that to a consider extent the church was also the judiciari as a matter of fact right until the conciliar code was compil in 1649 church rule often fill in the gap in state law compris the princ jurisdict it is understand that this great import of the episcop judici power was base primarili on it moral author dure the pre mongol period the metropolitan and bishop often had to reconcil princ at time of civil strife essenti the orthodox church at the time play the role of a most import factor of nation uniti let us recal that dure the sad day of the octob 1993 crisi it was the orthodox church that again took on this histor role and it is not to blame for the fact that the voic of reason was not heed it is necessari to dwell on the follow fact grand princ ivan danilovich kalita of muscovi invit metropolitan petr of kiev and all rus to settl in his capit the foundat of the cathedr of the assumpt of the holi mother of god were laid in the kremlin this made moscow the perman center of the russian orthodox church give it at the time the signific of a nationwid center the 25 year dure which the russian church was rule by prelat aleksiy 1354 1378 were the time of russia unif sobiraniy dure the minor of grand princ dmitriy ivanovich the head of the russian church was de facto ruler of the grand princip of muscovi his mission to the golden hord produc a lengthi respit from devast raid and when in 1380 the tatar warlord mamay move against rus it was grand princ dmitriy of muscovi who have been bless by the vener sergiy radonezhskiy succeed in bring togeth a unit russian host to deliv the land of russia from destruct russia histori offer numer instruct exampl of state organ in parallel with the monarch natur of power in the major of russian land dure the period preced the format of the unifi moscow state we can also see the experi of the lengthi exist of the novgorod republ where the three branch of power governor posadnik the administr archbishop spiritu leadership and a larg proport of judici procedur and princ protect from extern danger had their origin in the express of the peopl will gp fedotov the remark russian thinker from our centuri perceiv novgorod the republ of holi sophia as he describ it as the prototyp of russia futur democrat structur underpin by the primaci of christian valu but no matter what attitud we may adopt toward russia histori follow the unif of rus under the author of the grand princ of muscovi it is necessari to admit that the orthodox church continu to play an import role in the consolid of russian statehood the 17th centuri prove to be especi import the time of troubl immedi follow the reign of bori godunov which was mark by a seri of disast and main a devast famin again brought forth the orthodox church as the most import factor of nation self awar without which it would have been imposs to pursu state build in russia thus the church bless of the nizhniy novgorod resist made it possibl to preserv russian statehood in 1612 in 1613 the holi synod in other word the episcop of the russian church and lead repres of it clergi launch the initi of conven an assembl of the land to elect a head of the russian state this assembl at which the estat of the russian land were repres was an origin form of represent of the peopl unknown in the rest of europ after all the repres of the estat gather at the assembl of the land not to play polit game or exact privileg from the suprem author but to answer the question of how the russian state should be structur at that time the elect of mikhail the first czar from the romanov dynasti was condit by the fact that his father the prestigi boyar fedor romanov who had been forc to becom a monk by bori godunov and later becam metropolitan filaret of rostov and yaroslavl patriarch of all rus in 1619 1633 was an oustand spiritu leader of the build of the emerg russian statehood it is no accid that thereaft and throughout the reign of mikhail fedorovich assembl of the land were conven by the suprem author virtual everi year to ensur that it initi could be back by the church author and becom an express of the peopl aspir a special import in the caus of state build attach to the 1649 assembl of the land which compil the conciliari code which laid the foundat for the codif of russian law when peter the great start implement the transform of russian statehood on the principl of enlighten absolut he assign a special role to the church administr have abolish the patriarch and halt the conven of holi synod as the suprem organ of church power he show concern for form a perman suprem administr of spiritu forc which was name the holi govern synod in parallel with the govern senat which promulg imperi law on behalf of the suprem power and was also the suprem judici organ in the countri the synod if the monarch was unabl to exercis his right and duti exercis suprem power in the countri until such time as the legitim claimant to the throne was sworn in as head of the russian state it must be especi note that the russian church hierarchi play an extrem fruit role in lawmak activ in which it was brought by the suprem state power also in the 18th centuri later on when a repres organ of the peopl the state duma emerg in russia in 1905 it was no rare occurr to see among it deputi bishop and clergi of the russian orthodox church elect main by the peasant strata

patriarch of all russia and the principl of conciliar in church life it open coincid with prepar for the constitu assembl which was intend to establish new principl of russian statehood in this context the local assembl had a work section on the legal status of the orthodox church in the russian state which base the document it elabor on the fact that the orthodox church is a most sacr object for the vast major of the russian peopl and therefor the state must give it legal protect and patronag the countri histor fate dure the postrevolut decad develop in such a way that the orthodox church was not onli depriv of it tradit histor role but under the slogan of it separ from the state was also subject to the most blatant persecut that was a time when it paramount concern was the problem of surviv in an atmospher of artifici implant milit atheism but despit everyth the russian church manag to surviv and with the passag of time even to accumul a certain amount of social potenti the word crisi is nowaday one of the most frequent use word in the mass media but let us ask ourselv what sort of crisi is russia experienc now econom it would be strang that a countri with such natur and industri potenti would be incap of swift deal with it polit the multiparti system which is capabl of produc a serious struggl for power is still at it embryon stage as it were in our countri nonetheless we are inde at a stage of crisi at present and this crisi is moral the main question face russia now is what should be the moral guidelin of it futur state build this question has to be answer by the peopl themselv it would be appropri to recal the tradit form of dialogu between the suprem power and the peopl by conven an assembl of the land which could compris authorit repres of all social and profession group and the tradit religi confess in russia this assembl would not claim state power and would not compet with the exist repres organ it will not adopt ani act for mandatori execut but it will be abl to identifi the sore spot in our peopl life today on which those who have been task with state build in russia should focus attent in the first place as regard the particip of the russian orthodox church in this assembl this will not mean that it is regain ani state function or privileg but be an authorit social institut in the countri today it will thus fulfil it purpos and will help the russian peopl to preserv their ident and creat their state the govern and the new feder assembl are call upon in the veri near futur and joint with the russian orthodox church to compil a program for the restor and refurbish of cathedr church and monasteri an end should be put to all attempt at religi invas from outsid no matter how plausibl their motiv might appear missionari

product but on the other hand it has intensifi inflat and has led to the stabil of the flaw structur of product with which we are live today the govern took the path of detail a select structur polici which presuppos choic from option which have not live up to expect but our countri ineffici economi make it veri difficult to pick a sector which can be painless abandon the select of structur polici is also base on financi lever the uncondit and effici util of limit financi resourc presuppos their target util and rigid choic of prioriti at the same time the proclaim prioriti essenti extend to all

account for 70 percent of capit invest if we add to this the invest in hous construct the govern intend to control about 90 percent of all capit invest the implement of this program will lead not to

enterpris the new russian currenc will be gradual transfer to the central bank of the russian feder it will be convert into dollar at the rate of 1 1 the old and new rubl could circul in parallel at the same time the russian feder govern ought to launch a larg scale program to combat unemploy the labor forc be releas could be channel into the build of highway railroad and airport the new rubl will be initi concentr around export enterpris enabl them to recruit the most skill personnel this will serv as an incent for other enterpris hold foreign currenc to repatri it and convert it into new

passion have been rage in societi over the last few year about the right to privat own land and turn it into a commod to be sold and purchas this most complex question ought to be serious examin the

collaps of the ussr togeth with other polit social militari and other factor not direct associ with financ has aggrav this packag of problem severalfold there is no doubt that all these negat factor and their impact on the financi system will persist also in 1994 at the same time there are also the mistak and error commit recent which call for special mention the last two year have shown that the overcom of the slump in product and the acceler of structur chang in russia nation economi cannot be guarante exclus by the mean of monetari and credit polici furthermor such an approach is flaw in it veri foundat in the condit of inflat the capit of enterpris and bank are be swift devalu while credit oper are be essenti curtail even though the indic without ani adjust for inflat speak of an appar growth of credit oper and foreign currenc on balanc sheet if they were to be adjust for inflat they would be sharpli reduc the main caus of inflat are the sharp declin of product the arbitrari price set by enterpris in condit of monopol and commod shortag the budget deficit the breakdown of econom tie with enterpris in former union republ and cema countri and the export of russian commod at dump price these are the factor that lead to an imbal between the money in circul and the commod avil for purchas error in the implement of econom reform and the super rigid monetarist credit polici togeth with confus in calcul have intensifi the slump in product and fuel inflat the main lever for hold inflat back ought to be the credit support for viabl enterpris if enterpris do not receiv credit to meet product cost and cover defer payment they would be altogeth unabl to function and due to mass product stoppag inflat would be mani time greater in condit that encourag incess price increas and declin of the rubl purchas power it is imposs to achiev normal commod money circul includ the mainten of balanc between the total price of commod in circul and the total amount of money releas into circul what should be the specif measur that would make it possibl to satisfi the commod market at price accept by the major of the popul one of the strateg solut is to restrict the amount of money in circul last year this result in a huge total of reciproc nonpay price went up and the enterpris money evapor but credit emiss is still be curtail by whip up interest rate the rubl purchas power is fall uncontrol becaus price are rise without restraint the imbal between the valu of commod in circul and the total amount of money in circul is widen in a normal econom process money serv as a technic mean of payment when exchang for commod if there is no money commod money circul is slow down and disrupt sinc commod product is curtail although everyon cite the need for credit emiss to be held back by the central bank commod produc enterpris are in debt this is confirm by the correl of the growth of price and of money in circul over a two year period the former increas by a factor of between 100 and 1 000 while the total amount of money increas onli by a factor of 10 to 15 while commod produc are cut back and curtail product the budget deficit is grow at a mad pace each year but how are the state inordin rise expens to be cover if the enterpris revenu are fall and consequ budget revenu from taxat are reduc the differ approxim 20 trillion rubl will have to be cover by money emiss this reveal the main caus of inflat budget expenditur are begin to exceed the total valu of commod produc for circul but we cannot avoid deliber and control inflationari expenditur on invest and the product of commod produc even five year ago the countri would have need trillion of rubl to replac worn out equip and thus ensur simpl reproduct this account for 50 to 60 percent of all fix asset in product at today price the amount of money need would be 1 000 time greater without restor the fix asset we will be unabl to build a market economi and solv social problem meanwhil invest in the last two year have been scanti furthermor a sizeabl proport has been devalu becaus the invest period span sever year invest in product have been reduc by a factor of about five compar with the minimum that is necessari enterpris are consum their depreci reserv let alon their profit this is yet anoth consequ of irrespons and the fals percept of econom freedom evid we should not count on the foreign credit that have been promis therefor in order to reviv the economi we will be unabl to manag without inflationari credit emiss but a credit emiss that is accur verifi and control it must be note that in a healthi econom system high interest rate are set in order to reduc inflat in our own condit today high interest rate prompt a faster pace of price increas and further devalu of money fast growth of commod product can be achiev by lower interest rate while acceler the turnov of fund and provid target credit for the economi this mean an econom effect for both creditor and commod produc this is the way to extric ourselv more swift from the grip of inflat but we will chang noth in our life today without solv the general question of financi and econom polici without establish firm rule of the game it is after all no secret mani peopl are in favor of a market without rule primarili middlemen trader and dealer as well as some commerci bank with their high interest rate for credit fund by their borrow from the central bank which itself set the tone in this sphere the rule of the game in the market today can be establish onli by general agreement between all side this is normal behavior in develop countri the destruct of what has alreadi been creat will continu without such an agreement without ani organ principl the monetari credit system the dispar between the bank system model in russia and other countri is the main caus hinder their integr in a singl financi area the model appli in russia are substanti differ from the model of the world bank busi and encourag the specul commerci accumul of capit rather than it invest in product suppli commod to the market the second import reason hinder the integr of the russian and the world monetari credit system is the underdevelop of modern long term form of settlement in russia in these condit the attempt to elabor the best possibl cours in credit polici and reform the system of settlement in the nation economi is perceiv by the central bank of russia as a prioriti task the object of the bank of russia monetari credit polici are enshrin in the basic guidelin of monetari credit regul in 1993 ratifi by the suprem soviet and in the 24 may 1993 econom polici statement by the govern and the central bank both document set the main task of slow down inflat which devalu the popul money incom and save deform product and trade and distort econom guidelin for particip in econom relat proceed from the premis that the rate of inflat depend on the rate of money suppli it ought to be expect that after a certain time lag credit restrict should result in a slow down of price increas but inflat stood at 20 percent in june 22 percent in juli 26 percent in august and 23 percent in septemb dure the first nine month of 1993 wholesal and consum price increas by a factor of 73 and 63 respect thus the basic approach toward the curb of inflat has prove useless the rise price of energi sourc of gas in februari and of coal in juli remain the main factor of inflat the monopoli status of individu group of produc provid the main caus of the acceler increas of wholesal price and after a brief interv of consum price as well inflat in russia is expect to reach 900 to 1 000 percent in 1993 as a whole the state of the monetari credit sphere remain veri complex it is not onli instabl in the economi but also uncertainti as regard the state budget that hinder ani forecast of the futur dynam of growth of the money in circul and consequ ani effect regul of it level in order to ensur a stabl reduct of the rate of inflat the central bank action ought to be back by an appropri budgetari and taxat polici the ineffici distribut of central credit is fraught with the danger that a new crisi of nonpay might develop larg scale financi inject might be requir in order to avoid it and this in it turn will lead to an expans of unsatisfi effect demand and higher rate of inflat the graviti of this threat is prove even more graphic by the fact that 40 percent of central credit receiv by enterpris are use by them to cover current debt it is necessari to enhanc the effici of supervis and control of the activ of commerci bank when financ region program it is necessari to util the potenti of credit partnership and the advantag of mortgag credit and to creat municip bank as regard target state credit these fund ought to be primarili channel into the implement of specif project associ with the develop of market infrastructur at region level the most import prerequisit for an effici credit polici and the improv of the payment and settlement system is to preserv the common econom area and the unifi monetari credit and bank system within russia framework settlement between cis state one of the most complex problem concern settlement with the cis state mani of which have either switch or are in the process of switch to their own monetari system the regul of interst settlement is hinder by the rubl uncertain

consider for their polici aim either at preserv the singl econom and currenc area or at withdraw from it the agreement between russia and belarus on the unif of their bank system could serv as a

and must encourag and stimul coomod produc not in word but by lower the tax liabil of those who boost product and by give preferenti credit while the bank should amend the normat for the format and util of these fund the bank must stimul and encourag them to boost the volum of invest in product if we were to admit today that commod produc must be support these specif amend must be enact in current legisl and ani addit law that might be need must be adopt a major mistak is be commit today attempt are made to restrain inflat by virtual noth but monetarist method by rais the base rate and rigid limit the credit for enterpris and yet the rubl strength depend main on the status of materi product and the balanc of the state budget so far the economi in russia has not been function as a self tune mechan therefor it is of cours a mistak to appli all the method which oper in a develop market economi in these condit a moder tough credit polici would be the most appropri it must be tough but nonetheless we have no right to depriv the healthi nucleus of the countri economi of credit overnight there is the especi urgent question of the concept of the further develop and build of our nation bank system russia has approxim 1 800 commerci bank 88 percent of which are small and medium bank with a registr capit of up to 100 million rubl their interest must also be taken into account after all there is no uncommit money in russia no such money is held by the enterpris and organ which are the main founder of bank the econom market condit center under the russian feder council of minist govern conduct a studi of the busi activ of russia commerci bank there were 173 bank take part in the poll 79 small 46 medium and 48 larg one an analysi of the repli show that the major of

their reserv none of the bank has ani intent of reduc it staff number while some even expect to increas their staff nonetheless about 40 percent of banker report possibl cutback in their servic for state enterpris 72 percent believ that the financi econom situat of their client in the state sector will deterior more than one third of bank do not expect their deposit base to be boost by state enterpris almost all bank report that they do not plan ani cutback in credit for commerci structur in 1994 in this process they will give prefer to short term credit the commerci bank are strive to expand the sphere of their oper but the invest of the bank own fund in commerci enterpris is a high risk oper that could lead to a reduct of their capit avail and the emerg of difficulti with liquid and solvenc furthermor in individu case the bank use for such purpos not onli their own fund but also fund attract from their client thus expos not onli themselv but also their depositor to addit risk in this context the bank of russia plan to submit a propos on amend to bank legisl as regard limit the proport of the bank own capit be util and the format of regist capit by other nonbank legal entiti we need to work on a law on bank and bank oper and the central bank and in all likelihood it will serv a dual purpos mani of the administr measur today are essenti antimarket antientrepreneuri

amend becaus it is make the russian nation currenc depend on the demand for and suppli of foreign currenc on the dollar of the russian market the strengthen of the rubl will also be serv by the imposit of order in foreign econom activ which incur major loss of foreign currenc but even here the govern still retain unjustifi import subsidi and increas duti and tax which rais price still higher and fuel inflat now it is alreadi perfect clear that the period of transit to the new economi will take year bear this fact in mind the govern and the central bank must elabor a long term econom and

financi stabil lay the foundat for growth of invest but for the short term it can be confid forecast that there will be a further reduct of invest in the nation economi which in the condit of high degre of wear and tear or obsolesc of a sizeabl proport of fix asset could lead to a declin of technolog disciplin accid substandard output and breakag of technolog link among the question of foreign

section iv iv protect of the interest of russian speak popul 1 the contemporari status of russian the status of russian today could becom the most probabl caus of local civil war peopl in a seri of new state have move from word and slogan to actual deed latvia and estonia for exampl beneath the banner of protect the indigen popul have start introduc restrict on the right of the nontitular popul primarili via legisl on citizenship let us recal that about 40 percent of the popul in latvia and estonia are russian speaker with 10 percent in lithuania while the total number of russian speaker main russian in the baltic countri approach 25 million now they all are an ethnic minor there are about 950 000 estonian and at least 600 000 foreign live in estonia at present this separ was effect on the basi of a jurid act adopt by parliament the decre bring into forc the law on citizenship as it stood on 16 june 1940 in other word the day when the red armi enter the republ the resid qualif is two year with anoth year befor citizenship is acquir the law adopt a rigid approach toward repres of the nonindigen popul who are alreadi resid and have spent mani year work for the benefit of estonia now they have to undergo the two year resid qualif period and a further year on probat and must pass examin in the languag and their knowledg of the republ histori and cultur under the law more than 15 million peopl who are automat depriv of citizenship in the baltic republ could find themselv outsid the polit process their interest will not be repres by anyon even the previous elect to latvia suprem soviet demonstr the radic politician obvious desir to squeez russian speaker out of the polit process by simpli manipul the organ of elector district they ensur that the indigen lettish popul repres just over 50 percent won two third of seat in the suprem soviet under the new citizenship law the russian speak popul in latvia and estonia will not be repres at all in the organ of state power there is a sharp reduct of televis and radio broadcast from russia it is plan to legisl depriv major russian communiti in the baltic countri of the right to acquir higher educ in their nativ languag a unilater curtail of the network of russian secondari educ is under way the offens against russian cultur and the russian languag is one of the avenu of massiv pressur on the russian speak popul of the donbass account for 50 75 percent of the total popul in differ rayon moreov the fact that this offens is carri out on such a massiv scale and with impun make it possibl to describ it as ukrain state polici in a region with it own histori cultur and real bilingu the task of level the nation cultur situat in west ukrain and the donbass by forc has been set at state level this is prove by numer fact all the educ establish are sharpli and groundless reduc the number of studi period for russian languag and literatur while the studi of the russian languag is altogeth rule out at teacher train institut nonspeci faculti thus the lugansk teacher train institut russian philolog faculti has been persist instruct by ministeri circl to delet from it curriculum the practic train in folklor and dialectolog gather exampl of folk art and russian dialect the reason given is that there are no region where russian cultur has develop in the donbass even though year long expedit prove someth complet differ russian folk song tale poem and so on are widespread in the region and so are russian dialect associ primarili with the histor proxim of the don host there is a notic trend toward the creation of unequ condit for tuition the number of pupil at class taught in the ukrainian languag is lower than that of pupil in class taught in the russian languag by a factor of between three and five but the teach of a foreign languag from the first grade is introduc main in class taught in the ukrainian languag and so are the new and promis cirriculum in general the new form of educ establish are also gear to instruct in the ukrainian languag in lugansk onli high school for exampl class studi languag and literatur in depth are gear almost exclus to the ukrainian languag psycholog pressur is exert on lectur teach their student in the russian languag and incent are offer to those who teach special subject onli in the ukrainian languag this natur produc a drain of skill specialist at the same time peopl are deliber keep silent about the fact that the union republ thank to effort by the entir former union and the russian feder decis contribut creat modern sector of the nation economi use technolog that was at time more advanc than in the russian feder itself the best forc of the entir countri were thrown in to ensur higher and faster develop rate for the former union republ economi thus creat more favor prerequisit for the format of product and social infrastructur actual there rather than in the russian feder the nation intelligentsia activ influenc the self awar of the peopl perceiv the russian as the most substanti obstacl to the republ sovereignti and to the manifest of nationalist ambit the status of russian in kazakhstan is indic in this regard the introduct of a discriminatori law on languag in the republ prompt a huge wave of dissatisfact among a larg proport of the popul russian and russian speaker depriv of ani real opportun to studi the kazakh languag in the past are unabl to activ particip in the various sphere of societi life product educ scienc manag the servic sphere and so on the present languag tuition system fall short of the demand pose by life dissatisfact with the law is also express by 40 percent of kazakh who are not fluent in their nativ languag the discriminatori natur of the state program on the languag is boost by the polici of state publish hous thus under the subject matter plan for literari public the republ ana tili publish hous should have publish 79 titl the plan includ the public of nine book in the russian languag and nine in the russian and kazakh languag these are dictionari the remain titl 61 book in all are in the kazakh languag the proport is ident at other publish hous and yet it is emphas that the republ is multin and that kazakhstan has sign the human right charter the situat prevail in the educ system is no better secondari school are increas often convert and are switch to tuition exclus in the kazakh languag furthermor this is be done without augment the educ premis thus overload the school where tuition is in the russian languag no russian german ukrainian or other school are be open at all prosper enterpris are under attack by the nationalist mafia follow sever attack there are neither russian nor german left ani more at the pravda sovkhoz the best in the republ here is a typic case there was an explos at the ust kamenogorsk nuclear fuel plant beryllium product unit and 120 000 person suffer as a result a session of kazakhstan suprem soviet take into account the separat of ust kamengorosk resid who demand bilingu refus to proclaim the oblast an ecolog disast zone the galvan of the cossack movement is encount sharp reaction kazakhstan contain the land of four cossack host the ural orenburg siberian and semirechensk cossack organ are not be regist by the kazakhstani author at present while local court have firm rule that there are and there will be no

will be punish the result of inequ are obvious more than 200 of the kazakhstani parliament 360 deputi are kazakh and so are 23 of the presidenti council 30 member even though kazakh constitut signific less than one half of kazakhstan popul academician sartayev advis to kazakhstan presid declar kazakhstan land must belong to the kazakh forget that back in the 1920s the union leadership decis on the creation of the republ of kazakhstan spoke open of transfer to it a seri of russian oblast there have been numer attempt to insult the russian peopl heritag name that have been russian sinc time immemori are dsiappear from geograph map the church at the villag of kotelnikovskaya has been burn down the monument to yermak the great has been barbar destroy all russian name are be systemat elimin in kazakhstan guryev and other oblast while guryev itself has been renam atyrau the falsif of histori is becom increas blatant russia conquer and enslav kazakhstan and so on s akatayev leader of the

are allow onli to work in kazakhstan keep your nose out of manag the question of citizenship ought to be resolv in earli 1994 the republ russian speak popul will have to make a choic either to accept citizenship and legal lose ani hope of help from russia or reject citizenship and be depriv of all polit and econom right therefor a sizeabl proport of the russian speak popul is inclin toward the idea of migrat to russia especi sinc russia has alreadi adopt law regul the legal status of refuge a sizeabl proport of the russian popul live on the territori of former union republ no longer compris first generat migrant and has with perfect justif consid these republ to be it motherland thus more than one half of russian in the baltic countri have been born there approxim two third of them in latvia either are nativ of the republ or were brought there as children the major of the remain one third arriv in latvia not of their own free will but were post there on the republ request as specialist in the nation economi or were order to go there as offic they restor the war torn town and villag rebuilt the plant and factori or perform their militari duti their children and grandchildren were born there fear for their nearest and dearest and uncertainti about the futur are forc russian to leav the baltic countri and moldova where the declar of human right is crude trampl and there is overt discrimin against the russian speak popul huge mass of peopl in these region believ that they have been abandon to the whim of fate and that russia is incap of uphold their interest migrat process in the central asian and transcaucasian republ depend on the overal status of interethn problem and ani interethn clash threaten to bring forth an exodus of the russian popul thus the protect of the right and legitim interest of the russian diaspora in nearbi foreign countri is the onli farsight long term polici the strateg task along this avenu is to achiev guarante live and work condit for russian outsid the russian feder which not onli would rule out ani encourag of their departur but also would realli creat prerequisit for the preserv of their nation tradit languag cultur and nation self awar we perceiv this prospect as the develop of econom cultur and polit trend aim against ani attempt to establish reactionari ethnocrat regim on the vast space of the former union it is of cours hard possibl to reli on object reintegr tendenc for reviv that which has collaps under the weight of accumul contradict and gross error by shortsight politician there is no subjunct mood in histori there is howev an altern to such a develop of event but it is lament it is first the loss of econom independ by the newli form state includ russia follow the disintegr of the singl econom area and the nation econom complex which was unifi until the recent past their distinct western and their transform into underdevelop appendag of major western countri with a mafia crimin domest econom and polit structur it is second the intent or unintent flare up of inter nation or interethn conflict either as a result of the exacerb and deterior of the socioeconom situat and the impoverish of broad strata of the popul or due to the insolubl of question pertain to nation state belong of various territori militari properti and other categori of former union properti if the gravest of consequ for all our peopl are to be avoid it is imposs to ignor in polit the thousand year old trend toward ethnic and ethnocultur develop and collabor as a result of which a special type of eurasian civil start develop a long time ago across the space of russia and it associ territori the preserv of one own state ident today is a question not onli of human digniti but also of polit wisdom all these chang will inevit have an impact on million of russian and their relat in russia it is natur that such a turn of event will inevit prompt a social explos includ and let us have no illus on this account in russia itself and will becom a power factor for the develop of interst conflict pretend not to realiz this mean direct encourag such a develop of event 2 polit aspect a legitim way out of the situat from all point of view could be provid onli by restor of the common econom cultur and legal area uncondit remov of trade barrier introduct of benefit for member of the new econom and defens union adopt of common citizenship in the ninth year of perestroyka and after three year of democrat russia lack a clear foreign polici concept there has been no definit of russia prioriti or a concept

effort must focus primarili on russia allianc with the former union republ which have a larg proport of russian and russian speak popul they are primarili ukrain kazakhstan belarus estonia latvia uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and moldova this will make it possibl to solv the problem of almost 90 percent of ethnic russian and of mani russian citizen who are resid in these state it is in russia nation

toward integr via coordin there is an impress that out of the entir packag of problem on whose solut the cis ought to be work attent today is focus onli on two aspect the suppli of russian raw materi

settl the issu of citizen right are hard ever on the agenda the cis today certain need an organ capabl of coordin humanitarian question and eas the pressur of state border on the collect and individu right of citizen of ani nation the cis collect organ could also coordin the process of reform it is hard to reviv our econom mechan while differ part of the cis implement diverg concept of transit to market economi like for exampl when the western republ adher to the genuin sensibl limit of initi privat while russia is engag exclus in macroprivat the destat of harbor and airport oil and gold field

russian and european experi alik show that a real and dynam foundat for the re creation of a singl humanitarian econom and defens area can be provid by the interest of ethnic minor detach from their

the other tag recent attach to the nation which succeed in realli ralli the peopl on one sixth of the earth surfac 4 problem of migrat without a forecast of the true extent of migrat it is difficult to determin what financi resourc will be requir to compens refuge and forc migrant for the damag they have suffer and to provid facil for new settler the number of job that will have to be creat for them the real burden that will be impos on the social infrastructur at place where migrant will concentr and so on the return of russian from former ussr republ and the migrat of repres of non russian peopl to russia began long befor interethn tension reach the stage of open conflict and becam a bargain chip in polit struggl even back in 1979 1988 the posit balanc of the migrat to russia by russian who had former activ resettl in other republ was in excess of 300 000 the growth of the scale of migrat was also affect by the outflow of nonindigen peopl from region where non russian titular ethnic group had concentr in russia itself the northern caucasus the volga valley the siberian transbayk region and the northern belt of the feder in essenc these region show the selfsam symptom of discrimin against repres of nontitular ethnic group as in nearbi foreign countri among the advers consequ of mass migrat realli great import attach to the growth of social stress there is a signific deterior of the social awar of migrant themselv who have lost their former status and quit often the prospect of social success there is also dissatisfact among the resid of town and villag where they live unfortun the help given to forc migrant or refuge by the local organ of power and popul is clear inadequ the attempt by migrant to acquir a social nich in the new local come up against serious object difficulti the level of social tension has increas wherev refuge are concentr as soon as they have appear this is note both by the migrant themselv and by local resid the social and psycholog atmospher in which refuge find themselv is also indic by the result of a poll of the popul in 13 russian feder region when ask what polici do you support the answer were distribut as follow as percentag of the number poll accept citizen of all former ussr republ regardless of their nation 36 percent accept onli russian by descent 51 percent do not accept anyon 11 percent did not answer 2 percent one out of everi 10 person poll is against the accept of migrant while one half of those poll are inclin toward divid refuge and migrant into our peopl and foreign these stereotyp of mass and individu awar cannot be ignor they were graphic demonstr in practic in saratov and volgograd oblast dure the discuss of the question of settl german there and re creat a german autonom format in the volga valley the local popul unwelcom attitud toward migrant will intensifi as the shortag of foodstuff hous and so on worsen this can alreadi be seen at present respond of the all russia poll were ask what will be your attitud if refuge which may appear in your region are alloc hous out of turn are given job and are help with money from the state budget the answer were as follow 1 attitud toward help with employm nt posit 58 percent negat 15 percent difficult to answer 27 percent 2 attitud toward help with money posit 56 percent negat 19 percent difficult to answer 25 percent 3 attitud toward help with hous posit 29 percent negat 33 percent difficult to answer 38 percent the acut of the hous problem in russia where the number of peopl wait for hous is in excess of 9 million was clear manifest by the fact that less than one third of those poll are inclin to support the polici of prioriti hous alloc for forc migrant this indic of potenti conflict rise sharpli when the ethnic composit of migrant doe not coincid with the titular ethnic group at their new place of settlement in other word mass migrat is fraught with a chain reaction of interethn conflict the symptom of which can alreadi be seen specif they take the form of grow nation and attempt to initi pogrom against peopl of differ nation or religion in oblast which have taken in larg number of migrant there are differ forecast about the migrat of russian to russia the number of potenti migrant could includ virtual all 25 million russian live in nearbi foreign countri some 4 5 million peopl in the next 5 10 year this is the maximum size of the migrat flow which could be prompt either in the event of exacerb of interethn relat or as a result of the start of combat oper on the territori of former union republ accord to feder migrat servic data over the next 12 18 month we can expect between 650 000 and 12 million peopl to arriv in russia from nearbi foreign countri 300 000 400 000 from ukrain and belarus 250 000 550 000 from central asia and kazakhstan 40 000 100 000 from the transcaucasus and 25 000 45 000 from the baltic countri the mass migrat of russian from ukrain and belarus to russia and of ukrainian and belarusian to ukrain and belarus can happen onli in the event of militari conflict between the republ although in ukrain for exampl there are even now forc prepar to instig this process the situat with russian is even more complex in kazakhstan where there are about 6 million of them one fourth of all russian live in former union republ outsid the russian feder there is a larg flow of russian migrant from kazakhstan this trend is grow it is possibl to forecast three avenu and consequ three period of the migrat of russian to russia an activ migrat of first and second generat russian is expect from turkmenistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan azerbaijan uzbekistan and kazakhstan between 30 and 50 percent of the russian speak popul intend to emigr from there some 18 20 percent of russian intend to leav latvia estonia lithuania moldova georgia and armenia up to 11 percent of russian express desir to leav ukrain and belarus accord to poll result about 2 million russian intend to move to russia today becaus they feel persecut along nation and linguist line both now and in the futur the forc migrant from union republ are main engin technician skill industri worker teacher and physician in other word strict urban peopl who will be unabl to settl in the larg citi becaus of resid permit problem they cannot buy or build hous in town becaus the law forbid it this is whi mani of them perceiv their situat as hopeless there is hard ani need to comment on the polit view of present and futur migrant or their attitud toward the new polit and econom realiti which have turn them into outcast there are six special and transit recept point for refuge open and function on russia territori there is discuss of the possibl of set up similar point and region migrat servic in everi oblast the committe for migrat affair proceed from the premis that this is not onli a calam but also to a certain extent a benefit for russia the govern is begin to realiz that the recept and settlement of migrant will requir larg invest but those return to their histor motherland are almost the most enterpris skill and industri part of the nation a public committe for the settlement of forc migrant is function in just under one year it has process about 1 million person and has help 20 000 but the work on migrat problem is fragment there is no coordin at state level and resourc are be wast mani categori of migrant have found themselv altogeth outsid the sphere of state regul it is clear that the feder migrat servic will not be abl to cope with the swell flood of

obvious promot the further harmon of interst relat there also is a press need to conclud interst agreement on human right with all former union republ monitor of their fulfil could be carri out at both state and public level the status of econom relat with various state must depend on the observ of these intern agreement and the principl of intern law it is expedi to support the creation of

is not aim against other peopl and state russia path lead through peac solut of problem and mutual cooper to univers and just peac 5 problem of russia econom mutual relat with cis countri the rate of the slump in product and inflat continu to grow in cis countri in 1993 the govern of not a singl cis republ succeed in halt the process of econom declin on the whole the total volum of industri product in the communiti was reduc by 20 percent in compar price over the year the share slump was not affect to ani larg degre by the differ natur and pace of econom reform in differ countri in the condit of transpar border and unifi money circul within the rubl zone the lack of coordin in econom activ hurt the financ of neighbor the imbal in reciproc deliveri has alreadi evolv into an imbal in the intern settlement of cis countri on the whole it is possibl to agre with the opinion of world bank associ k mikhalopoulo and d tarr the situat as regard trade and payment in the former soviet republ was distinguish by chao which reflect the exist of a seri of problem the disorgan of the credit monetari and payment system was at the heart of these problem the main problem is that the reduct of interrepubl trade will promot the further declin of the volum of output and incom therefor polit strategist will have to creat mechan for the transit period which would help the new state to restor the effect flow of trade and avoid further serious breach of this flow in the short term support in the longer term the restructur of their economi and it integr in the world economi after all the sharpli increas depend of each cis state on the extern market becom a condit for the function of their economi as a matter of fact these realiti are onli just be realiz and taken into account in the econom practic of cis countri on the whole as 1993 has shown the step up of the economi extern depend will continu this depend will be most graphic demonstr in the sphere of satisfi the cis countri energi need sovereign has undermin russia potenti as energi supplier let us add for object sake that cutback in the rate of oil extract start four year ago accord to estim by russia ministri of fuel and energi oil extract drop by a further 50 million tonn in 1993 in other word will reach onli 340 million tonn if this pace of reduc the extract of black gold is maintain then in the veri near futur the fuel and energi complex will be work to meet onli russia own need which today stand at 240 million tonn oil export increas more than threefold but this increas was accompani by a reduct of deliveri to cis countri by an averag of 50 percent in this context russia could be suspect of wage a cold war against ukrain and the baltic and central asian countri but such an approach would be base on inertia of thought fact prove whether it is advantag for russia to deliv oil product to the former republ russia deliv it output primarili raw materi which are competit on the world market to nearbi foreign countri at price equival on averag to 30 40 percent of world price and acquir from nearbi foreign countri output at price equival to about 70 percent of world price moreov in mani instanc russia often fail to receiv ani payment at all for it export for exampl have deliv to nearbi foreign countri about 50 million tonn of oil to a total valu of 65 billion by way of payment it receiv machineri and equip worth onli 700 million but russia extern econom depend was also increas and has almost trebl have reach 14 15 percent of gnp this is more than in india and japan let alon the unit state extern depend demand addit foreign currenc resourc for the economi function natur some of the sourc are gas oil and oil product come back to the idea of cold war against ukrain it is appropri to recal one contenti problem last year ukrain sold abroad at world price of cours 8 million tonn out of the 33 5 million tonn of oil it had receiv from russia accord to some estim the amount earn from this deal is equal to for exampl the cost of build a major intern airport at say novosibirsk capabl of earn an annual profit to the tune of 700 800 million russia economi today bear the heavi burden of addit export and import expenditur associ with transit charg for cross the territori of neighbor state but the safeti of good in transit is not guarante not even by ukrain of cours the press cite numer fact about russia debt to other cis republ but the overal balanc is this russia had a posit balanc of about r750 billion similar trend will also persist next year even though the govern has taken a seri of measur to put an end to nonpay apprais the situat in russia econom tie with nearbi foreign countri it can be said that 1993 saw the start of sober up from euphoria in the cis it is of cours prematur to conclud that the balanc of centrifug and centripet forc show that the latter are stronger but this awaken coupl with disappoint and lost illus has also brought in a certain proport of common sens section v v the creation of favor intern condit for the implement of reform in russia 1 exist realiti in order to elabor russia strategi in the sphere of nation and intern secur it is necessari to analyz the posit it occupi in the world and the essenc of it intern interest as determin by the profound chang of the last few year there are four main factor make up the system of russia polici guidelin at least for the 1990s the first is the fact that the soviet union has disintegr thus put an end to the world bipolar structur there has been a radic chang in the geopolit role play by russia which has becom a compon of the world communiti russia has inherit from the ussr 75 percent of it territori 51 percent of it popul 60 percent of fix product asset in term of valu and 76 percent of enterpris produc mean of product it account for 90 percent of oil extract 73 percent of gas extract 63 percent of electr generat 80 percent of crude oil export and almost 100 percent of natur gas export it procuc more than one half of the gnp produc in the ussr in 1990 but russia is not just smaller than the ussr in size it has found itself in a fundament new environ to the west and to the south where the former soviet republ lie furthermor some of them have been profound hit by domest instabl they are extrem suscept to extern influenc and are in conflict with one anoth the paradox is that formal these are foreign countri as far as russia is concern in fact howev they remain insepar link with it both by their common histor past and by the multitud of live econom cultur social and psycholog bond the second factor russia is experienc a most profound econom and sociopolit crisi whose solut still lie far into the futur at the same time by dint of it size and of the polit and strateg legaci inherit from the ussr russia remain one of the world lead countri it will not be at all simpl for russia to find it place in the intern arena russia new leadership bear the burden of a difficult twin task to creat a new system of foreign and domest polici ture it into a catalyst of radic market reform and at the same time to overcom the burden of problem inherit from the past the third factor the russian feder as a genuin democrat republ russia no longer has a plan economi but it still has not acquir a market economi the unitari state has collaps but the best possibl balanc between central and local power has yet to be found furthermor the feder today face the threat of disun and fragment into separ princip final the fourth factor is associ with chang in the surround world we are wit the onset of a more tradit but also a much more complex time of multilater diplomaci intricaci of contradict and coincid of state interest shift coalit and limit polit goal the threat of a univers war is declin but there is a grow danger of local conflict fraught with escal of combat oper in various region all this indic that the mainten of peac in the futur will requir activ work by intern and region organ to ensur collect secur as well as joint peacemak action by the power proceed from what has been said abov what are our fatherland main foreign polici prioriti at present russia has three interlink suprem foreign polici prioriti the first is to ensur polit stabil in the countri prevent war and settl arm conflict on the territori of the former ussr both within and between individu republ primarili by polit mean the second is to prevent the emerg of hegemon power in europ south asia and the far east which would strive to extend their influenc to region in the former ussr where the situat is unstabl the third is to preserv the status of a great power occupi a special posit in the world geostrateg structur the main point for russia is to ensur polit stabil and to prevent and settl conflict across the former ussr should instabl and potenti conflict there grow further this would threaten both russia territori integr and it econom and democrat reform the maximum desir task is econom and polit integr on the basi of equal right voluntari and mutual advantag for cis countri primarili russia ukrain kazakhstan and belarus if the desir prove unattain then the vital import minimum task for the russian feder is to prevent the creation of a hostil coalit russia is proceed from the premis that the helsinki principl of the inviol of border must provid the foundat of mutual relat between the former ussr republ ani revis of border would be permiss onli via peac talk sanction includ the use of forc would be permiss onli in the event that a countri leadership pursu a polici of genocid toward ethnic minor and this is recogn and defin as genocid under un rule germani turkey japan china and other are potenti capabl of pose the threat of region hegemoni to russia in the 1990s of cours nobodi is accus the aforement countri of current act along this avenu but a sober forecast of the shift balanc of forc and of the geopolit situat make it mandatori to consid the possibl of chang in their polici which are not even contempl at present the unit state is russia most import partner in counter region hegemoni the remain center of power are still not capabl of realli influenc the situat in hot spot be they in the near east angola or yugoslavia the caucasus or afghanistan russia is plan to pursu this prioriti use differ method in differ region in europ for exampl the guarante for prevent ani militari polit expansion by lead state is perceiv in the develop of european integr and the stregnthen of the csce as an organ of collect secur and collect respons to ani potenti aggressor in the past the ussr use to advoc the simultan disband of nato and the warsaw pact organ wpo not onli has the nato bloc not been disband but is is actual build up it might this organ cannot be smooth transform into a european secur structur we believ that a stabil of the situat in the russian feder on the basi of market economi and the develop of democraci will creat the need for a fundament new intern organ possibl on the basi of util and develop element from the structur of the ec the west european union nato and the csce and with particip by russia the unit state and canada the russian feder polici in asia minor malaya aziya and south asia could take the form of direct includ militari resist to outsid interfer by agreement with the republ under threat the natur of the multipolar world adjoin the transcaucasus is much more complex russia partner here is object iran and turkey in south asia the mainten of a certain balanc between them is in line with russia interest despit the fact that the west would obvious give prefer to turkey as a member of nato the mainten of the us militari presenc in japan is in line with russia interest in the far east in the event of withdraw by the unit state and of china headlong econom and militari strengthen japan reaction could onli take the form of acceler remilitar a clash between the two huge power over korea taiwan hong kong or southeast asia could also involv russia in the conflict ani sharp chang of the balanc of forc in favor of china or japan and the emerg of hegemon aspir in one of the two power could pose a direct threat to russia far east it is obvious that russia need to retain it posit as a great world power this mean russia particip in the un secur council as one of it perman member and it role in other intern structur it also mean particip as far as possibl in the mainten of peac and the repuls of aggress includ along the line of peacemak forc within the framework of the secur council the csce and other and genocid termin oper sanction by the unit nation and region intern organ russia advoc activ prevent of the prolifer of nuclear and other mass destruct weapon a tougher regim to control the deliveri of missil and missil technolog and the elabor of agre quota and restruct on the arm trade as a whole the problem of russia militari strateg pariti with the unit state deserv special mention it will be necessari to continu the mutual balanc reduct of russian feder and us strateg nuclear forc on new term here we need a transit from mutual deterr through the abil to deliv a crush counterstrik on the aggressor to joint manag of strateg stabil this is whi talk will constitut the sphere of special mutual relat and mutual interest between russia and the unit state 2 nation interest let us examin russia specif nation interest from the viewpoint of intern secur retain the great power status this is russia natur right vest in it thank to it econom potenti the success it has achiev in scienc cultur militari might and so on guarante eurasian stabil whenev the eurasian balanc of forc has been disrupt russia has tradit been the main victim therefor the desir by ani one state or coalit of state to domin eurasia will not be in russia fundament nation interest nor can our interest be serv by attempt to isol russia squeez it out of the black sea and the baltic sea reduc foreign econom commod turnov chang it structur and so on ensur polit and econom stabil in state all along russia border this is a key interest for ani power but the problem of prevent the emerg of conflict zone along the border is especi import for russia which has the world longest land border and with it complex relat with neighbor which are root in the past parri and prevent potenti threat the world in which we are live now is a world of power partnership and power rivalri within the framework of rigid durabl structur despit the chang which have occur in the last few year especi the end of the cold war the improv of relat between the unit state and russia the rapproch to a certain extent between east and west europ and so on more sophist principl of power balanc and power collabor still remain the foundat of contemporari intern relat indic like econom scientif and intellectu potenti play a greater role in the system of state might but the militari compon still domin the structur of interst power real militari nuclear missil confront on a global level remain onli between russia and the unit state for the time be the continu of nuclear confront between our countri is object and inevit in the forese futur furthermor the grow nuclear missil potenti of the prc and west europ also pose a militari threat for russia in the 1990s final russia cultur secur and it origin are threaten by the west liber individualist ideolog to the exent that collectiv still domin awar and think and today russian realiti at the region level it is necessari to proceed from the fact that in the event of exacerb of the domest crisi virtual all of russia neighbor could potenti rais sundri territori claim although the econom cultur and other categori of secur are not obvious link with militari secur mani arm conflict have start with mistak commit in nonmilitari sphere therefor the prevent of threat to russia must be activ wage across the entir spectrum this is russia main nation interest 3 foreign polici we deem it import to singl out the follow basic object and guidelin for defin the strategi of russia develop and behavior in the world communiti of peopl the russian feder is constant present in the arena of world polit life it is a differ matter that russia domest situat and it geopolit environ at present do not favor the pursuit of an activ global polici and it region interest will call for the greatest of effort in the next few year the possess of a mighti nuclear potenti doe not chang the situat either for the first time in mani year our countri is in a situat wherebi it doe not face ani definit or in ani way signific extern militari threat territori disput involv countri which will certain not resort to militari forc for their solut provid of cours russia remain a unit state all this is except advantag for concentr the countri effort on the solut of the domest task concern radic transform and the problem constant emerg in mutual relat with cis countri relat with germani at least over the last two centuri have occupi a central posit among the prioriti of russia foreign polici but the experi of the 20th centuri with it two world war the cruel battl without preced in histori and the huge sacrific and destruct suffer by both side would seem to indic the irreconcil of the two countri interest true enough the period between the two war produc a whole rang of mutual advantag econom and even militari technic cooper that was the period when the averag german realiz that the situat in germani develop well whenev it relat with russia are good russia need a new east asian and pacif polici it backbon must be provid by relat with china as it main partner not onli in the region but also in the broader global context the posit potenti in the histori of russian chines relat is much more power than the negat both countri interest in the preserv of each other integr is a most import factor of russian chines collabor the complex of the problem of the korean state unif also prompt china and russia alik in the direct of a unifi approach toward maintain the immut of world war ii result in the far east both countri are reliabl partner in the caus of uncondit observ the yalta confer decis on the far east in other word confirm outer mongolia status and the fact that the kuril island and south sakhalin belong to russia it is possibl to defin the follow long term interest of the secur of the russian feder preserv general stabil in the world capabl of resist local arm conflict elimin the seat of tension close to the russian feder territori and fraught with the explos of arm conflict maintain normal relat with all state primarili with european and asian state and elev these relat to the level of partnership strengthen and develop the peacemak potenti of the unit nation the csce and other with a view to the earliest possibl polit settlement of conflict threaten to evolv into arm clash the further deepen of the process of disarma offer an opportun to reduc the russian arm forc to the minimum level necessari to ensur extern secur and honor the russian feder intern commit restor the russian feder intern prestig as the legitim heir of the former soviet union and a great power recogn by the world communiti the fewer the forc be divert extern the faster will the establish of russian statehood proceed in the condit of the world deepen interdepend this can happen if the intern situat remain stabl for a number of year on end without arm conflict capabl of shake this stabil at the same time it is imposs to rule out the probabl of local conflict flare in region where there are confront along religi nationalist or other line unfortun these region lie along the former soviet union southwestern and southern border it is in russia interest to elimin ani local conflict develop in the world by polit mean and as swift as possibl this is whi the russian feder must support by all possibl mean the polit peacemak potenti of the unit nation the csce and other intern organ it is in our interest to follow joint with the other power the path of deeper reduct of armament and arm forc guid by the principl of suffici for defens sensibl reduct of russia arm forc and armament will not onli eas the econom burden but will also make it possibl to util the high technolog potenti of defens enterpris for the russian economi recoveri when determin the size of the arm forc russia need it is also necessari to consid it commit for the mainten of univers peac russia medium term interest includ normal and stabil both it domest situat and the situat in it immedi environ the cis countri yugoslavia and afghanistan they includ normal and stabil relat with cis countri reach agreement with them both on the coordin of common polici and on specif action in the sphere of mutual secur elabor and introduc a system of collabor with nato countri strengthen tie between cis countri in the defens sphere achiev an accord accept to russia on settl the question concern the southern island of the kuril chain so as to lift the barrier to the develop of relat of cooper with japan agreement with the prc enshrin the fact that the side have no reciproc territori claim normal relat with the afghanistan pakistan iran triangl with a view to elabor an agreement on mutual recognit inviol of border and establish of cooper includ in the defens sphere but without in ani way infring upon the close relat with india establish normal relat with all state which will emerg in the place of the former yugoslav feder special attent must be given to conflict flare both within and between cis countri includ arm conflict there is no time to be lost therefor the task of normal and stabil relat with the cis countri cannot be put off and must be includ among medium term task awar of the communiti of interest in ensur collect defens will be an import factor of the develop of centripet forc the next two to four year will be especi import for the russian feder futur it will be virtual imposs to resolv the task of econom reviv without elimin conflict and their potenti sourc proceed from this premis it is possibl to defin the follow short term interest of the russian feder secur termin interethn conflict in region adjoin the russian feder caucasian border reach accord on an econom area within the framework of the former soviet union and the appropri border regim between state implement the accord concern the state border secur regim along the entir perimet of the former soviet union reach accord between the russian feder and other cis state on question of protect against nuclear attack and of strengthen the intern regim for the nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the sober up which is occur in cis state in the econom sphere and the grow awar of the consequ of the breakdown of econom tie indic that this avenu could success serv the solut of the task of ensur russia general safeti and secur it is obvious that in order to organ a singl econom area it will becom necessari to solv the question of border regim both between cis state and along the former soviet union perimet unless this is done it will be imposs to avoid econom sabotag close the extern border otherwis the russian feder border will also be penetr halt the rise of crime and especi of organ crime and so on the most vulner sector of the russian feder border lie in the region of interethn conflict it is therefor in our nation interest to extinguish all interethn conflict along the caucasian border and achiev the restor of peac and tranquil there in today condit it is imposs to ensur the secur of border between cis countri without help from the arm forc from the polit viewpoint it would be disadvantag for russia to becom the first to introduc arm protect of border with cis countri it would therefor be expedi to begin with a general accord on border regim what will be the natur of border the extent to which arm forc will particip in their protect and so on it would be expedi if the new state were to use their own forc to protect their border this appli especi to the southern border this section of the border has been close in russia interest but it is unfair for russia alon to bear the respons and cost it is in the cis state nation interest to receiv guarante against nuclear attack the likelihood of which has to be taken into consider in today world the russian feder is in a posit to back up such guarante at the same time howev we are interest in have all cis state join the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the nuclear power today are interest in strengthen the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon and rule out ani access to them for adventurist and irrespons politician furthermor joint action by all nuclear power in this sphere promot the develop of relat of trust between them which is also in line with the russian feder interest 4 threat to the preserv of state stabil and secur measur for their neutral the idea of superpow status base upon unrestrain militar was the primari caus of the soviet union defeat in the cold war and it subsequ collaps the russian feder return to such a polici would pose the greatest threat to it statehood and secur as for the extern threat it natur has chang wherea previous the arm threat origin primarili from the west there is no worri origin from this direct at present at the same time it would be prematur to rule out militari danger from the southwest in the event of ani protract of the arm conflict in yugoslavia capabl of involv neighbor countri the conflict religi aspect is especi danger becaus we are talk about three faith with adher in mani countri includ the russian feder romania could also produc a seat of tension or rather an outburst of romanian great power chauvin which has not abandon the idea of re creat a greater romania incorpor moldova and the dniester region land should this happen ani such action by romania will inevit prompt reaction in bulgaria the dobruja question in hungari transylvania and even in russia the dniester republ a danger seat of militari threat could develop in the region adjoin the caucasian and central asian cis state islam fundament compris mighti forc and in today situat it nurtur the hope of creat a bloc of islam state under the auspic of pakistan iran and less like turkey such a bloc will inevit tri to includ in it orbit azerbaijan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan it cannot be rule out that it might attempt to influenc kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan as well when evalu this danger it is necessari to take into account the chang natur of mutual relat within the triangl of the russian feder the arab countri and israel the normal of the russian feder relat with israel and the latter susten through emigr from russia coupl with the fact that the russian feder has to a certain extent distanc itself from libya and iraq are provid ground for grow anti russian feel in the arab countri final it would be a mistak to complet rule out the possibl of militari pressur from the southeast or from china should this happen demograph pressur will not be the onli factor in oper elabor of nation consensus on foreign polici question it is an axiom that a state is strong through the uniti of it citizen posit state have overcom the difficulti face them most easili when there has been a communiti of view among their citizen it is import to make the major of the popul awar of the benefit and even the inevit of russia present cours of friend relat with all countri while reduc the volum of it extern commit primarili those impos in the past for ideolog reason continu of the cours of achiev accord on disarma question the widespread differ of opinion on whether the cours of achiev accord on further reduct of arm forc and armament is advantag for russia are to a certain extent harm to the elabor of nation consensus on foreign polici question the time has come to abandon propaganda declar like the complet ban and withdraw of nuclear weapon and to take a realist point of view a certain quantiti of nuclear potenti is a guarante of secur both for the russian feder and the cis state in addit it is necessari to aim both now and in the forese futur for a ration regul of the balanc of the nuclear missil potenti of russia the unit state britain franc and china which remain the stabil foundat of the contemporari world order this regul ought to be implement through deep cut of nuclear arm the strengthen of the regim of nonprolifer of mass destruct weapon and missil technolog and the creation of a global system for the world communiti protect against nuclear missil attack as propos by us the switch to this point of view will facilit talk with the other nuclear power includ talk on the most ration level of nuclear deterr it is also import to emphas that we are hope for understand of our desir for real nuclear disarma by ukrain kazakhstan

take into account the object reduct of the role play by militari strength as the main instrument for protect russia nation interest the foremost task now is to creat a system of collect respons by cis state and by state former ussr republ which have not join the communiti for the mainten of peac in the region the earliest possibl resolut of conflict on it territori and the elimin of seat of arm confront russia could initi the creation of a region secur council which in it activ would implement the un idea of collect secur it is well known that the breed ground for ethnic conflict is creat primarili by violat of human right the trampl of ethnic minor interest the insult of nation digniti and the most acut problem of protect the right and interest of the russian popul in nearbi foreign countri it is necessari to jurid formul guarante of legal defens includ the right to hold dual citizenship this would be promot by the creation of an intern commiss for the scrutini identifikatsiya of nation legisl there have been forecast of the inevit of ensur collect secur by forc and use peacemak forc in hot spot on the territori of the former ussr without ignor the role of the unit nation and the csce it has to be clear realiz that the conflict are occur within the zone of russian interest this is admit by the parti to the conflict themselv when appeal to none other but russia proceed from this fact it is necessari for the unit nation and the intern communiti to give russia peacemak forc a mandat to oper in the region conflict zone under un auspic and with the status of blue helmet one of russia most import foreign polici object is it particip in the strengthen of eurasian secur russia cannot accept the tendenc toward nato expans via the admiss of east european countri to the bloc this approach is akin to the build of a new movabl berlin wall this would requir the solut of mani question both pure militari and econom the strateg group of russia troop in the west now is such that the potenti admiss of former wpo countri to the north atlant bloc would necessit it radic restructur involv huge econom expenditur let alon ani other loss the countri nation economi will incur the format of a collect secur system must be switch to a new track by propos the disband of nato and the format of a new broader and more open structur with particip by russia and the east european countri possibl through the csce the posit experi accumul by the csce must be extend to other region in the world on the basi of russian interest primarili to the asia pacif region by galvan it foreign polici in the asia pacif region russia could initi the launch of a process similar to the csce in this region and the hold of a summit confer follow the helsinki model one of the stage of this process could be the conven on russia initi of the first asia pacif interparliamentari confer in for exampl vladivostok two specif initi are propos to hold talk to defin quota for the arm trade and to creat a perman confer of arm export countri within the framework of a new intern organ to be set up in the place of cocom coordin committe for multilater export control there is full justif for place ecolog issu among the seri of intern secur problem the conclus of an intern convent on liabil for damag dome to the environ as a result of the nuclear arm race could be an effect measur for the mainten of intern ecolog secur two main trend domin the west polici at present a to use all possibl mean to push russia into copi the western primarili the us model regardless of ani consequ for the countri and the popul b to prevent russia from take full advantag of the west modern technolog achiev and drive it main toward the product of raw materi fuel and semimanufactur in other word to sink the countri in backward in the third world mani peopl believ that ani expect that the west and the unit state will help the reviv of a mighti and independ russia are at best naiv the west is increas lose it interest in us becaus first we have lost our former econom and militari strength and second we are no longer claim to be creat a social altern to the west at the same time as can be seen from b clinton speech in the long term and by attract resourc for it modern from germani and japan and possibl from franc itali and britain russia could weaken competit between the western power in the econom sphere it is also worth note the question of reviv the bipolar system but on a complet new basi the idea of form a second pole is certain not the product of abstract imagin or a specul project the shortcom and danger of the monopolar system make it necessari to consid the altern idea of a second pole the us monopoli as the sole world leader could tragic destabil intern relat by it veri natur the bipolar system offer a more stabl basi for cooper between the center of world polit it will enabl the third world countri china and russia to protect their common and individu interest in a more or less organ way and consequ to guarante the greater effect of their effort the creation of a second pole could also strengthen militari polit stabil in the countri adjoin it and could becom an instrument for settl conflict without the west interfer a serious motiv for this could be provid by the need to protect nation cultur asset to counter the expans of western mass cultur and at the same time to pool effort for the shape of competit nation cultur on the basi of the peopl own vital valu and the renew of their tradit equal collabor between all cultur could serv as a counterweight to the hegemoni of western mass cultur which is be implant final a substanti justif for form a second pole is provid by the quest for a new type of civil to replac the domin industri capitalist one whose exhaust and crisi are increas obvious and univers recogn this object could attract sympathi for the second pole among mani progress stream in the west which are concern with the quest for a new way of life collabor between the two center would most probabl lead to posit chang in the natur and content of the first pole activ and give it a more realist orient even the actual discuss of the problem of creat a second pole could lead to favor albeit partial posit chang in our opinion bipolar will acceler the process of form a global system on the basi of the balanc of interest and becom a step in that direct all of mankind includ the atlant center is interest in creat the second pole becaus it offer a program for extric from the crisi be experienc by the whole world although the second pole is need part as a counterweight to the first their relat need not be antagonist but could be built on the principl of cooper includ cooper between the unit state and russia a return to the bipolar model of the world is not the onli possibl option the multipolar system also has it advantag in ani case it is import to ensur that this system guarante stabil and russia occupi in it a posit befit the status of a great power 5 disarma problem russia did not inherit ani militari polit alli from the ussr it is object unabl to maintain the mighti arm forc which the soviet union had in mani direct the paramet of russia defens were move far beyond the limit of it state border now the countri either has no such paramet or they have end up be unusu close to it central region the end of the great confront between the two superpow did not lead to the triumph of the principl of nonus of forc in intern affair as proclaim by the unit nation or to the disband of militari polit allianc creat or so the explan went to parri the soviet militari threat moreov the sole remain superpow display a notic stronger desir to impos it will wherev it feel that us interest exist includ the baltic countri there is no need to explain that if russia intend to solv it own problem guid by it own nation interest it must be strong in everi respect includ by no mean least in defens question we have the full potenti to do so this doe not run counter to the long term peacemak guidelin proclaim by russia presid in his januari 1992 messag to the un secretari general the principl of effect global and region militari polit stabil declar in this messag also presuppos measur for mutual disarma this is precis whi russia offici took over from the ussr the baton of reduc the militari potenti of state and eas the level of intern tension it confirm the commit under intern treati and agreement to which the soviet side was a parti and also sign in januari 1993 the russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start ii thus the track taken by russia in the sphere of the disarma process is in line with the one which the ussr follow dure the last year of it exist but the differ militari strateg condit in which russia now find itself demand of it the elabor of new concept and approach toward the solut of problem concern the arm limit and reduct nuclear disarma problem the salt i and salt ii soviet us agreement in the strateg arm limit sphere were underpin by the principl of equal and ident secur which was agre by the side it main criterion was the ensur of militari strateg equilibrium this in the side opinion not onli coincid with the secur interest of the partner in the talk but also promot the stabil of the world situat but the last soviet us treati on the reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start i contain provis make it possibl to bypass this principl if necessari the treati shortcom includ not onli the univers known notion count of weapon which total negat the side initi proclaim intent to reduc their strateg potenti by one half but also a seri of provis place the side in unequ condit for exampl the treati impos stricter limit on land base icbm which have tradit been the foundat of the ussr and now of russia strateg might at the same time the most liber interpret has been appli to reduct requir for heavi bomber in which the unit state enjoy a threefold advantag there is absolut no justif for exclud from the treati effect the strateg sea launch cruis missil which are object more advantag for the unit state the soviet side simpli fail to obtain agreement from it partner at the talk that the abm treati should be observ while the start i treati is in forc consequ the unit state retain the possibl to chang the strateg potenti to it advantag by implement the sdi program the start i treati has still not come into forc despit this a new now russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens weapon start ii was sign in januari 1993 follow compar brief talk but this treay is not flawless suffic it to mention it provis on the procedur for the convers of icbm and submarin launch ballist missil from multipl warhead to singl warhead and the reorient of 100 us heavi bomber for the perform of nonnuclear task the start ii treati provis potenti offer the us side an opportun to re instal more than 4 500 nuclear warhead on strateg deliveri platform within the briefest of time frame bear in mind that the total number of nuclear warhead the side may hold after the reduct should not exceed 3 000 3 500 unit russia run the risk of find itself in a situat wherebi the unit state have for some reason denounc the start ii treati could veri quick doubl it strateg nuclear potenti under the term of the treati russia should it wish to do the same would not be abl to boost it potenti by more than 900 unit the same way nonetheless russia has ratifi the start i treati and has express redi to ratifi the start ii treati with all their shortcom and posit aspect at the same time it is perfect clear that the process of the limit and reduct of strateg arm will be continu at some stage it will be join by other nuclear power on what basi should these talk be conduct what should be their ultim goal the question of complet elimin of nuclear weapon will hard be rais in the forese futur the other nuclear power are not rais this task even as an idea the agenda will evid includ the question of arriv at some maximum level for strateg nuclear arm to correspond with the so call minimum nuclear deterr back in the past the ussr express readi to support this idea and to discuss and agre it strateg mean and basic criteria it might possibl be use to repeat this attempt nevertheless regardless of whether this concept will be discuss on a multilater or bilater with the unit state basi russia will have to determin what in it militari strateg posit should be meant by minimum nuclear deterr and this should be the subsequ guid principl when elabor posit for talk on strateg nuclear arm and on nuclear arm in general this will help prevent ani reduct of russian nuclear forc below a certain critic limit it would not go amiss to also apprais the extent to which this criterion correspond with the start i and start ii treati when accpt the concept of minimum nuclear deterr at the talk it is necessari to bear in mind that this decis will inevit necessit the examin either in parallel or joint with strateg nuclear arm of the question of tactic nuclear arm especi if they are deploy so as to reach target on the other side territori includ ship base weapon as well as the uncondit observ of the abm treati limit of convent arm forc and their armament the consist process of disarma must certain becom the normal polici of ani peacelov state in the post confront period furthermor the outbreak of interethn and other region conflict testifi that the reduct of the potenti of convent arm forc and armament is a task as import as that of reduc strateg and tactic nuclear potenti the continu of talk on convent arm forc and armament is especi topic for russia it is necessari not onli becaus it is becom increas difficult to man and maintain such larg arm forc but also becaus we will have to honor committ under the 1990 treati on convent arm forc in europ the parti to which was the soviet union and not russia this is not the same thing therefor strict speak follow the disappear from the militari polit arena of one of the collect parti to the treati the wpo and later on of the ussr new talk ought to be held on the reduct of convent arm forc in europ and a new accord ought to be reach take into account the sharp chang in the situat in this import region of the planet on 8 juli 1992 russia ratifi the treati under which it also commit itself to the stage by stage reduct of the numer strength of it armi and navi from 28 million to 21 million men by 1995 and to 15 million men by the year 2000 at the same time the nato state did not embark on ani limit and reduct of the numer strength of their arm forc and firm refus to take naval forc one of the most import compon into account when determin the militari strateg balanc enjoy undisput superior in naval armament capabl of deliv strike against land base target carrier born aviat sea launch cruis missil nato was unwil to lose this imbal this posit is most typic of the entir western approach toward talk on the limit of convent arm forc in europ it envisag the elimin of imbal but onli in those categori of armament where the wpo enjoy the advantag it is clear that ani potenti futur talk cannot leav the question of naval armament outsid the scope of agreement especi as regard armament design to strike against land base target the veri fact of the accept of commit under an accord elabor for anoth state the ussr and for differ militari strateg condit realli goe beyond the framework of ordinari common sens which indic that russia ought to accept and honor onli commit which have been thorough and specif elabor for the russian condit otherwis the situat may reach the point of absurd as it did in 1993 dure the withdraw of troop from germani and the attempt to deploy them in the north caucasus militari district it emerg that russia could not do this without breach sever provis of the treati it had ratifi it also emerg that russia cannot show ani concern for it southern flank as it see fit sinc it is constrain by limit under this treati much has been and is be said about the principl of suffici there is hard a singl state in the world which would declar that the militari organiz develop of it arm forc is guid by the principl of insuffici or supersuffici therefor the term of simpl suffici is meaningless the term defens suffici or suffici for defens would be more appropri to the concept of russia defens polici but the mean of even this term demand thorough elabor onli when this term has been given specif content in line with the russian state militari doctrin it can and must provid the basi of posit for subsequ talk on arm limit 6 the need to improv the mechan for manag militari organiz develop ani polit program of the leadership need a finetun mechan for their implement otherwis they will remain noth but wish think in the sphere of militari work we are still nurtur the illus that we are talk onli of a partial reduct of the arm forc and a partial switch of the militari economi to the manufactur of nation econom output and that the actual mechan for manag militari organiz develop can remain basic the same fundament document in the defens sphere are be implement with difficulti there is no doubt that the basic provis of the militari doctrin will creat the necessari prerequisit for the organiz develop of de facto new arm forc for russia for the reliabl protect of it interest for the elabor of long term militari technic polici for the creation and further develop of qualit new forc and for the train and educ of the personnel the militari doctrin approv by the presid basic ensur that russia will honor it intern commit on the reduct of armament and arm forc and the mainten of peac the specif applic of the militari doctrin in the sphere of the militari economi is defin in the presid special edict no 1850 of 11 novemb 1992 wherea onli certain clarifi remark can be made as regard the doctrin militari and militari technic aspect there are doubt aris as regard the econom mechan this is becaus attempt are be made to retain the old method of manag and adapt them to the complet differ socioeconom condit now develop in russia under the former administr edict system of manag when all element of the econom organ were not onli subordin to the state but also belong to it the main mechan of manag were program and plan five year annual and so on the plan ratif was follow by the implement of the principl that the plan is law and must be fulfil at all cost at time it was wreck more often than not it was fulfil but the mechan function now the situat has chang radic complet differ law oper in the market economi even the law on defens adopt in 1992 enshrin that the state order in other word the plan issu from abov call for mandatori fulfil onli in wartim financi and econom incent should be use in peacetim the budget and the taxat system becom the main instrument of manag it is therefor anachronist for the militari doctrin in it section on militari technic and econom foundat to reli on elabor and implement of long term up to 10 15 year program for armament and militari equip on the basi of state defens order financ by the state attent must main be given to a comprehens substanti and balanc defens budget it is the budget that bring togeth the contradictori interest of various depart involv in the solut of task concern the countri defens suffic it to recal the august septemb 1993 outburst of passion surround the budget at the highest level in russia this is whi the budget need independ expert apprais it will help the practic implement of the doctrin militari polit provis and it is through the budget that civilian control will be exercis over the activ of the power depart this is whi repres of various nonstat institut advoc a public discuss of the defens budget comprehens control and prompt account for it fuilfil the basic provis of the militari doctrin also contain other weak point which prompt critic by the opposit inde a seri of provis need clarif and amend to the extent that life and russia militari strateg situat will chang challeng and potenti histori main lesson is that we won world war ii but lost the leadership race which is run accord to econom rule have lost it superpow status russia slid headlong to the rank of develop countri and now even of regress countri for the first time in the last 40 year we are not threaten by the perman danger of global militari conflict but the domest instabl the chao the devast in the economi and the mental of loser pose an equal threat to nation secur the fundament new polit realiti of which our countri citizen are becom pain awar is that for the first time throughout it thousand year histori russia has becom a depend countri it depend at least on foreign creditor the dollar rubl rate of exchang foreign aid and invest import deliveri and raw materi price on the world market the russian feder foreign polici is no longer fulli autonom intern bank and agreement are larg tri to dictat even our domest polici we are virtual without alli in the world on the other hand there are fewer extern enemi too russia has join the system of multipolar coordin of intern secur the situat is signific wors within the area of the former ussr interethn conflict have flare along the border the former militari polit and econom allianc and institut have been destroy new one have either not been creat or are not function the nation pride of great russian has been denigr the choic that societi and the state now have to make is not free either today we have to choos from a veri limit number of option either russia will remain a fulli depend countri or it will remain partial depend or russia will strive for full independ have decid this crucial issu for ourselv we will be abl to choos the sole scenario for the further develop of event it appear that onli the second option is the most realist it presuppos develop base main on relianc on our own strength but with a high degre of extern aid but our futur freedom in decisionmak will be limit in proport with the degre of depend to paraphras w churchil famous sentenc it can be said about russia that we no longer have ani friend we have onli partner whether we like it or not this world is base on respect for the strength of author and the might of the state unfortun we cannot expect the former respect without have the former might consequ the most import task of russia leadership over the next few year is to restructur the economi modern fix product asset and reduc the energi and materi intens of product the econom financi polit and militari might can be boost onli on this basi onli a program for steadi econom growth over the next 10 15 year can ensur signific progress in the russian economi success reform democraci is fragil all countri that have travers the long path of nurtur genuin democraci know that a young democraci unless it is legal econom and sociopolit protect is as a rule doom to degener this is the mortal danger at present all this is aggrav by the fact that the new structur of life we are build in russia is still far away from genuin divers the social base of reform remain narrow the shape of a genuin middl class the foundat of futur stabil took the wrong path from the veri begin the restor of our domest viabil in the sphere of product invest technolog educ and energi is the most import task for ensur both domest and extern secur stabil and independ this is the basi on which the new nationwid ideolog should be formul the govern local administr and feder assembl deputi must realiz we are live in a chang and chang world the independ state economi can no longer remain strict nation differ between domest and foreign polici are fade in our relat with cis state it is import to convinc demonstr the role of destruct econom nation and cooper with them in the quest for peac way to resolv ethnic crise threaten stabil in russia europ and the world it is also necessari to be awar that have fail to organ our own effici product of competit good we are forc to import them from abroad thus creat addit job over there rather than at home and doom our own worker to unemploy and poverti the opposit also appli this is whi the major of social problem and crise in 1994 will be associ with the economi and with domest and foreign polici the realiz of this is alreadi halfway to solut and the adopt of correct decis is halfway to success the other half will be determin by russia citizen their mood new incent for labor disciplin and entrepreneurship respect for the law and faith in reform hundr of correct law may be promulg the world best constitut may be adopt but we will not extric ourselv from the system crisi unless man feel the need to live and work better the central problem in 1994 is to restor the prestig of state power and creat an effect mechan for the law oper and for monitor the fulfil of adopt decis nation secur begin with reliabl protect of russia citizen against ani attack and infring it is necessari to radic review the attitud toward this question becaus the problem of human right stand right behind it whi should the assassin of one us citizen in ani countri immedi result in inevit and effect sanction while the assassin of russian offic in georgia and tajikistan goe unpunish the state might was not creat in order to remain inact the experi of the latest mass oper to impos elementari order in the capit and the countri show that the popul will understand and support ani action by the author to put an end to crime this doe not in ani way contradict the norm of democraci moreov it ought to be born in mind that the author of the russian feder govern feder assembl and presid is larg determin by the qualiti of our idea valu and leadership and the competit of our good in the world market rather than by superior militari might we will have to solv the budget deficit problem curb inflat strengthen the regim of save and increas capit invest we also need a taxat system and a legisl system capabl of boost product rather than hinder it the lost height in the sphere of health care educ vocat train and social secur must be regain step by step follow the disintegr of the former econom tie there has been a sharp deterior of the condit of the russian infrastructur as a whole and target invest will be requir there the follow problem will be inevit exacerb in 1994 inflat will evolv into gallop hyperinfl the rise price of energi sourc will produc a domino effect a race in price of foodstuff commod and servic there will be a further slump in product and a seri of sector will come to a halt on a nationwid scale there is a threat of social explos in the further growth of the strike movement whose particip will increas often and in parallel with econom demand make strict polit demand the govern resign the presid impeach societi corrupt will reach an unpreced scale the rise in crime will take main the path of grow number of econom crime and gangster like format demograph regress higher mortal rate reduc life expect declin birth rate pension and declass element will die off on a massiv scale unless effect chang are introduc in tax legisl the gap between the richest and the poorest strata of the popul will widen and will exceed all world indic we can expect a signific increas in the number of russian speak refuge from nearbi foreign countri to russia which will signific complic the social atmospher in mani region the govern will have to firm appli econom sanction against neighbor state where the right of the russian speak popul are violat new seat of interethn conflict will possibl emerg 1994 will see a higher proport of privat trade free enterpris and the privat sector of product in general but the bank system will have to be made more flexibl and effici with a view to encourag the develop of product rather than redistribut potenti econom progress in russia in 1994 will depend larg on the restor at a qualit new level of region and intern tie partnership and cooper as nation currenc are introduc in a seri of cis countri and the singl rubl zone is be destroy it is forecast that they will be swift devalu against both the rubl and the dollar russia could be swamp by the flood of russian bank note be sent back this could be wors than the size of ani emiss in term of it inflationari consequ there will be a need for emerg monetari reform and the introduct of a new rubl back by the intern russian bank fresh attempt may be made to seced from the feder and the separat of it compon may be step up russia today has been bled almost dri and it cannot continu to act as a selfless donor for nearbi foreign countri sole on the strength of the inertia of the proletarian intern ideolog it can be forecast that there will be a tenfold increas of the number of attempt to illeg export commod and raw materi from the russian feder in 1994 the govern will inevit face the problem of build hundr of border checkpoint along russia new state border with all former union republ includ cossack detach and settlement and a firm reject of border transpar full scale consul and embassi will have to be open and a larg number of bilater treati and decis will have to be adopt in contrast with the major of govern organ and institut we are forc to forecast someth which has been disregard hitherto russia is approach an ecolog disast it is necessari to prompt introduc in russia tough standard of environment qualiti and sanction for their violat even includ crimin liabil russia talent have alway been and still remain one of it categori of nation wealth the so call brain drain abroad has reach unprecend level at present the nation scienc cultur art and literatur have been shunt to the preipheri of state interest it can be said not just about oil and gas field but also about the russian talent that by silent back this antin polici we are sell off our grandchildren heritag and depriv them of prospect for their intellectu and spiritu develop russia success in the explor of space have alway been and still remain a matter of nation pride it is necessati to adopt a target program for the long term preserv of scienc intens product unit and space reasearch to encourag privat and foreign capit invest in space research and to creat new job if we miss the opportun to adopt radic decis about the futur of scienc and space research their degrad will becom irrevers and this in it
