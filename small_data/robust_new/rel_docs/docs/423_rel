whose member and follow ar known by the symbol of the letter l made by separ the thumb and the index finger the lscg wa establish as a polit parti on 26 januari 1990 it is differ from other five valid parti in that sinc it establish it ha been advoc a montenegro constitut as an independ state perov consid the lscg a parti of polit discontinu in montenegro perov we ar veri proud of the fact that in our histori there wa no parti that we could us and add to our polit project can be reduc to onli on sentenc whose element should be consid as thei interact here is the sentenc free individu free nation independ montenegro liber civic democraci unlimit privat properti and a free market therefor we ar a parti that want to shape the polit public opinion of montenegro in that sens we notic all asset of montenegro it enviabl cultur and histor heritag it extrem favor geopolit posit it except natur and potenti natur resourc accord to our estim if montenegro function as an independ polit and econom entiti all those potenti could make it on of the richer area in the mediterranean in three to five year we consid ourselv privileg and thank god for have put us on such a divin land we want to chang the cours of montenegrin histori especi that of the post world war ii era whose develop concept have been destroi montenegro friendship with budisa ogurl there is a certain lack of clariti regard the real polit power of the lscg some hold you ar realist the strongest opposit parti while other point at the montenegrin parliament sai that you actual repres by onli 13 deputi perov let me tell you the truth on 26 januari 1990 we had 57 member and todai we have more than 19 000 member and that figur can best be appreci in the light of the fact that without refuge montenegro ha about 620 000 inhabit we mostli gather intellectu youth modern peopl we base our idea on a sentenc of our great ancestor marko miljanov who said that he who defend himself from anoth man is a hero and he who defend anoth man from the evil inher within himself is a man inde the liber union todai hold 13 out of the 85 deputi seat in the montenegrin parliament let me remind you that in 1990 on the basi of the elect held in decemb we onli had on deputi in the parliament which then had 125 deputi and that both the first and the second elect in montenegro were undemocrat a farc for we mean much more for the polit life of montenegro then on can conclud from the number of seat we hold in the parliament ogurl be a leader of the strongest opposit parti in montenegro how familiar ar you with the situat in croatia and to what extent could you be compar with budisa s hsl croatian social liber parti hsl croatia s lead opposit parti perov i think our program orient ar veri close otherwis we have veri good contact with the hsl we had contact befor the war as well and to our great pleasur we manag to preserv them regardless of all past and present conflict i can sai that mr budisa and i have a veri friendli relationship we do not recogn the fry ogurl and what ar your relat with the so call fry do you admit to live in yugoslavia at all perov we simpli do not recogn the fry as a countri we did not go to the feder elect and we do not intend to in the futur either let me explain why the fry is a result of an invalid referendum held here in montenegro and the qualiti of that referendum is best describ by the fact that it from pass the parliamentari decis of the vote apparatu of the democrat parti of socialist dp on hold that referendum to put vote slip in ballot box there were onli seven dai therefor in just seven dai peopl had to decid on the state statu of montenegro which is not a seriou deadlin in other state not even regard some municip problem let alon regard those pertain to the state we think that the referendum stole the countri of the montenegrin and we did not want to take part in it work i will tell you a stori that describ the situat to peopl who ar not veri familiar with mani montenegrin qualiti thi is the stori to recogn the fry would be the same as when for exampl somebodi steal 5 million dollar from you open hi own bank with the monei appoint himself director and offer you whose monei he stole the posit of a clerk in that bank and you accept the offer hope that us the intern legal organ of the bank you will get hold of your monei some dai the dp who promot that theft want to convinc us that the job of a bank clerk is great thei refer to it as be an equal in the fry we think that the posit is unaccept we think the citizen and the intern commun must hear about that theft and try to achiev justic i e to return what wa stolen milosev demand acquiesc ogurl doe montenegro have ani state attribut at all in thi situat perov no it onli ha minist lekic who think he is a minist and a prime minist who think he is a prime minist and the presid of the republ who think he is presid but we should look at it from a differ angl the rule parti the dp doe not exist at all it is a small interest group that becam veri rich thank to war profit and the black market and thei realiz that milosev s iron grip is no longer in their interest now thei ar try to distanc themselv from milosev s regim for he is no longer satisfi with the level of their sycoph until now thei were kneel befor milosev and now he demand acquiesc i e for them to kneel and be down on their elbow that is a littl too much to demand even from them and thei ar try to present to the world the fact that thei ar still on their knee as a kind of democrat effort and so on consequ by mean of minist lekic and presid of the republ bulatov who suddenli becam a peacemak although he organ war time persecut in montenegro thei ar try to present montenegro as someth differ which it realli is but not becaus thei want that but becaus civic opposit in montenegro is an import factor for foreign polit repres minist lekic and presid bulatov ar the democrat face of an essenti antidemocrat power ogurl how do you interpret demand to abolish the montenegrin defens ministri and foreign ministri perov the defens ministri wa abolish at the request of the armi and becaus local author did not serious resist and as to the foreign ministri it will abolish itself anywai i think that in the next coupl of month mr lekic will not be abl to go anywher from the airport in tirana for nobodi will want to have him the essenc of antidemocrat author is most obviou in it relat to the opposit where that space for the opposit is be persist narrow as well as the space for the media peopl ar arrest for be member of certain parti thei ar maltreat follow by secret polic their telephon ar tap that is all a reflect of those author that actual function in legal and polit provisori situat for montenegro is definit not a state we and the serb ar not on ogurl you ar probabl bother by the fact that europ and the world think serbia and montenegro ar on for i suppos that montenegro is not a recogniz separ entiti perov ye that is a great injustic to montenegro inde it is not done on purpos for thei seem to be interest in the real situat when thei consid montenegro thei look at the statist and the result of the elect thei do not want to hear our explan that those were undemocrat elect ogurl let us get back to the countri you do not recogn doe the feder assembl exist at all perov the feder assembl is a circu that entertain slobodan milosev and hi wife mirjana markov who write homework for politika and duga that bodi make no decis whatsoev all decis were made in milosev s studi or in some other room the feder assembl wa destroi the moment seselj join that bodi belgrad journalist stojan cerov recent wrote a wonder sentenc describ the situat in the parliament he said that ever sinc mr seselj appear in the feder parliament that bodi look like a cellar with a broken sewag pipe it look no better todai ogurl is it a coincid that late on hear the montenegrin demand their own church new agenc airlin compani perov that is not a coincid regard the montenegrin autocephal church justic prevail that dai at cetinj the montenegrin orthodox church ha again becom autocephal which it wa for 300 year and it becam obviou that the serbian orthodox church ha been an intrud in montenegro sinc 1920 when the then regent of yugoslavia and later king aleksandar karadjordjev abolish the montenegrin orthodox church against canon law and annex montenegro to serbia sinc that time the territori of montenegro ha been expos to the assimil process of belgrad elect no the peopl have not yet suffer enough the process of impos greater serbian idea on the territori of montenegro gain momentum after risto radov becam the metropolitan bishop for that man is tell the montenegrin everi dai that thei ar the result of communist balkan broz josip broz tito fabric that thei do not exist as a nation and so forth when peopl realiz that thei could not baptiz their children in ani of 660 montenegrin church if thei want to baptiz them as montenegrin but that thei can onli regist them as serb of serbian religion that wa the final straw the same hold for marriag ogurl you live under sanction i have been here onli four dai tell me how do you manag at all perov peopl still have some suppli left mani famili have somebodi work abroad but the fact is that you cannot do much even if you have german mark for there is noth to bui shop in montenegro have noth on their shelv except for perhap two or three item until just a coupl of month ago street dealer would exchang german mark todai that doe not help becaus price ar sky high on kilogram of someth that cost 5 or 10 german mark dm in the west cost dm30 in montenegro that is horribl ogurl do you want parliamentari and presidenti elect in montenegro now perov no peopl have not suffer enough yet given some time the montenegrin will have to decid which wai to take the road to total destruct which is immin in thi situat or thei will realiz that it would be best if thei themselv decid about their destini we think that the onli wai out of thi situat is to demand polit sovereignti for montenegro for montenegro is suffer under sanction for on reason onli becaus the polit author were so close to milosev s regim there ar some sign from the west that if montenegro becam independ sanction would be lift from it after lift sanction we would be a littl below zero and i am convinc that due to the compar advantag of montenegro and the fact that it could be save by a rel small amount of monei montenegro could recov even with the present destroi infrastructur ogurl you ar accus of want to sell montenegro to the italian veri cheapli perov well those imput come from belgrad and go to belgrad we definit do not want to sell ourselv to anyon but we would like to commun with the world if that were in our interest why can we not sai that we will see who offer more we know what belgrad ha given us and what it offer a fairi bring joi from lovcen ogurl tell us you opinion of an event that happen two year ago when dubrovnik wa fierc shell what do you think about that hundr kilomet long black spot on the conscienc of the montenegrin perov i will tell you what i think the entir dubrovnik oper except for some goal reveal by gener kadijev in hi book the war as i see it had a much deeper mean for montenegro and the idea behind that oper wa to discredit montenegro on a global level and the oper manag to do that consequ for on year the entir planet wa abuzz with rumor that the montenegrin were shell dubrovnik destroi it and plunder and so forth that is true but on the other hand it is also true that sever statement and interview that slobodan milosev gave to the world press confirm what i have said ask what he thought about the event in dubrovnik he alwai repli he had noth to do with that that thei should ask the author in podgorica inde the author in podgorica were not respons for the mobil but thei did noth to stop that campaign and then in an interview i told mr bulatov he should realiz that those who aim their gun and cannon at dubrovnik ar madmen and that wa insan polit and that as the presid of montenegro he had to commit himself and choos between the glori of dubrovnik and what it stand for in a slavic world and the glori of kadijev s epaulett so if he should decid on dubrovnik and that would not be a dilemma for ani normal man i told him he should kneel befor those peopl who were badli manipul and try to get them back to the border of montenegro howev he opt for the glori of kadijev s epaulett for the role of a pawn he went to the battlefield thei took hi pictur while vojislav seselj person review some troop the final result of that campaign wa that the tradit montenegro all the stori of courag braveri moral and so forth were lost on that dubrovnik battlefield and thei can never be told again we feel veri badli about those horribl event not onli becaus of the suffer of the inhabit of dubrovnik and konavli in montenegro we organ a vigor anti war campaign which unfortun wa not broadcast we stage sever ralli and the on in cetinj wa the biggest of all with 15 000 peopl i realiz that the montenegro in my heart wa save the moment those 15 000 peopl start sing a fairi bring joi from lovcen dubrovnik forgiv us the result of that antiwar campaign wa that not a singl attempt at mobil in montenegro succeed and if it were not for us the consequ would have probabl been much wors dozen of peopl return from the battlefield threw their weapon awai and accept the polit messag of the liber union so that in a wai dubrovnik becam a catharsi of our movement on the other hand we must do everyth to apolog to the croat and to croatia and especi to dubrovnik and konavli and that god will on dai the montenegro i have in mind will do it best to help dubrovnik heal it physic and spiritu wound and that our two nation can start commun again not an inch more not an inch less ogurl what border do you want for montenegro as a countri perov the present on our postul is that the present border of montenegro ar the border of montenegro as a state and we consid them a realist express of montenegrin polit militari and diplomat power or impot throughout histori our motto is not an inch of our territori more not an inch less ogurl and what about prevlaka perov we know to whom prevlaka belong todai it obvious belong to the republ of croatia under unprofor unit nation protect forc command and we have alwai said that those two and a half kilomet of rocki land ar not worth the death of ani montenegrin let alon those 200 unfortun young men who di in vain for someon s unreason goal prevlaka would be worth fight for if thi were 1852 but that becam complet nonsens when fighter airplan were invent howev you must understand that propaganda in montenegro wa such that goebbel wa a real amateur in comparison the entir histor milieu wa reconstruct everyth croatian wa pronounc ustashi peopl were total mislead and it wa all ad to a veri incomplet and bad educ system in which histori lesson boil down to event from 1941 onward and peopl had no idea about the deeper strata of their histori ogurl in a wai the croatian public is interest in the destini of the croat in boka kotorska perov the croat in boka kotorska especi in tivat were under enorm pressur we must sai that and we ar inform that some of them left in the meantim which we in the liber union frown upon we ar try to do everyth to protect their human right in montenegro let me tell you becaus we support the croat we were accus of want to see boka kotorska belong to a greater croatia due to the fact that our member ar also albanian and we protect the albanian we ar accus of want a greater albania for defend the muslim we were accus of be a part of the teheran plot against the heavenli nation and for be montenegrin it is obviou we ar anti serb and so forth howev exactli becaus our parti is thi open thing ar turn to our polit advantag we must not be satisfi with that for todai montenegro is face destruct

howev there wa a seriou chanc of my be liquid befor i enter the courtroom consequ object polit interest wa outweigh by other factor garmaz so you have decid to us the trial over the event in parliament to put the author on trial seselj ye i am go to us thi trial to put slobodan milosev and hi wife mira markov on trial garmaz why mira markov seselj mira markov ha all the power in serbia slobodan milosev ha prove to be a henpeck husband with hi wife order him around and make all the decis she is just like elena ceausescu that is the main reason also she is the lead ideologist of the leagu of communist movement for yugoslavia a veri danger polit parti which is actual a terrorist organ that ha alreadi commit heinou crime in these part garmaz but the leagu of communist movement for yugoslavia is not in power seselj it is not in power but thei ar veri influenti for thei ar front by the wife of the presid of the countri the parti organ the well known kidnap of sandzak muslim from the train garmaz can you prove that seselj of cours i can it wa organ in belgrad and mani peopl were involv includ some 10 militari truck which were park in front of the train you see someth like that which happen a year and a half ago in view of the involv of so mani peopl and so much equip cannot remain a secret thei carefulli plan the crime so as to blame it on radovan karadz at a suitabl moment at which thei did not succe furthermor we announc yesterdai that the leagu of communist movement for yugoslavia particip in arm the muslim in certain part of bosnia herzegovina garmaz why would the

be a seriou countri garmaz you have recent state that the croat will creat a fourth yugoslavia seselj that is not exactli what i said the fourth yugoslavia will first of all be creat by the west with the help of those balkan politician who accept that option milosev ha alreadi accept a new yugoslavia for he is count on the unit state to accept him as the head of the new yugoslavia that is where he

FBIS4-55493: bfn interview with biljana plavsic vice presid of the republ of srpska by branka andjelkov in belgrad date not given woman in the middl of the road text for some peopl she is the serbian empress for other the biggest mistak the serbian leadership ha ever made biljana plavsic vice presid of the republ of srpska doe not want to give up radic we ar not in a posit to make compromis she sai if peopl s vital interest ar at stake my attitud ar not radic in the neg sens of the word mr plavsic ha no intent of withdraw mani of her statement which in the serbian republ ar often consid neg becaus as she sai the problem li onli in their interpret we talk with mr plavsic in her offic in the bosanka resid andjelkov in the view of mani peopl the crisi around gorazd and the nato involv mark the begin of a new attitud of the west toward the war in bosnia herzegovina how would you assess the new polit situat as far as the serbian side is concern plavsic if serb ar not obedi there will be bombard again thi will happen if we do not do what thei want accord to western criteria we were told thi veri clearli by the latest ultimatum sinc we agre with these rule of the game by agre to withdraw our weapon from the sarajevo front it is too late now the west explain the attack on gorazd with the fact that gorazd wa a safe haven but thi is senseless becaus the unit nation ha not done anyth to protect the safe haven in bosnia herzegovina thei were not demilitar the muslim armi wa suppli with weapon without ani control the un protect forc even help them thi mean that the west did not have ani justif for that attack if there is ani new ultimatum for other unprotect area we should refus all compromis andjelkov do you believ nato will get involv in event in bosnia herzegovina in the futur too plavsic thi time it look like the unit state had not made a mistak by not give in to 1 300 000 serb in bosnia herzegovina we realli gave them a chanc to show to their peopl that their threat were effect if thei continu to us threat for protect and unprotect area it is quit clear what should happen it ha been clear for a long time alreadi what should be done but there ar peopl who do not seem to know thi we shall certainli be bomb sooner or later the west doe not know howev that the serbian peopl in the war region ar alreadi complet resist to threat thei do not respond to them ani longer and when you ask them about bombard the onli thing thei sai is thei should start at last let them drop these bomb a threat that is repeat again and again lose it impact with time i can sai onli on thing thei do not know the mental of the serbian peopl at all the serb cannot be scare andjelkov wa the action in gorazd necessari howev do you not think that the negoti process would be differ had there been no gorazd crisi plavsic it wa gorazd s turn after sarajevo had there been no crisi in gorazd there would have been someth els we can expect continu pressur the west ha now ask for a four month ceas fire let me remind you that bosnian presid alija izetbegov ask for the same thing befor and you know why he want to strengthen hi armi in these four month he doe not need these four month in order to reach peac anywai let us assum that thei need four month to carri out polit negoti to reach some kind of peac some kind of agreement if we show resist dure these negoti thei will us threat again but we must not respond to them we shall certainli find ourselv in the situat in which we shall simpli have to do our job no matter what kind of threat thei make andjelkov where is thi lead to plavsic nobodi want to realiz that there is a war in bosnia herzegovina thi is a veri special war but it is still a war there is the attack war faction and the other which defend itself and i want to repeat that we were attack by the croatian muslim coalit our live the exist of our peopl were at stake in everi war there must be on parti that lose and on that win whenev it is said that it must not be mention that somebodi ha won thi war thi goe beyond common sens how can an armi be stimul to defend itself if it is forbidden to win there is no logic in it andjelkov if nato becom involv in the conflict in bosnia herzegovina it could easili happen that the serb lose accord to the war theori you have just explain to me plavsic it is veri difficult to make predict if we ar isol it doe not mean that we have to lose i think that vietnam wa a big loss for the unit state and thi is not the onli exampl we have alwai known why we ar fight we have alwai defend ourselv we have alwai seem to be in somebodi s wai as if we had built a hous in the middl of the road you fight in a complet differ wai if you know that you will not exist unless you defend yourself thi is the best possibl motiv apart from that there is a great sens of respons in the unit state for everi human life lost without good reason if 10 us soldier had lost their live in our territori clinton would be endang especi becaus he is alreadi under pressur becaus of the latest scandal in the unit state andjelkov what is the present attitud of the republ of srpska s leadership doe it support war or peac plavsic sinc the london confer we have been search for a solut to achiev peac we want to achiev peac but not at ani price we do not want peac if it mean that we have to give up territori we do not want peac if the digniti of the serbian peopl is lost we cannot do thi peac can onli be achiev if the three side sit down at the negoti tabl and start negoti it cannot be negoti howev as long as there is no peac andjelkov what is your attitud then plavsic peac peac and peac we ar offer peac which should be follow by negoti andjelkov do not you think that becaus of gorazd you ar farther awai from peac now than befor plavsic i do not think we have lost anyth we even won someth at gorazd our civilian popul that fled in august 1992 ar now return to their home in gorazd the unit nation said that the serbian armi had to withdraw to a 3 km ring around gorazd so that civilian ar protect now if thei protect the muslim thei have to protect the serb too whatev is good for these peopl who return to their home in gorazd sinc gorazd belong to them is good for us too thi make us hope that peac can be achiev andjelkov ye but without russian help it seem what wa the reason for russian envoi vitalii churkin s sharp word to the serb is it perhap your statement that the reason for such a larg number of serbian plane in the air wa an air show plavsic i am afraid that i shall be too sever as far as churkin is concern it ha been clear to me sinc the veri begin that churkin is a man who ha onli on task which wa assign to him not by russia but probabl by the unit state we have been veri cautiou toward churkin from the begin and it is good that the serb have not given him their confid we have learn in thi war that there no ar histor friendship as for exampl with franc or russia there ar onli interest the present russian polit is directli link to the monei russia recent got from the west if thi sum is distribut to the russian popul it mean that everi russian citizen got 5 it is horribl to lose the digniti of the largest slavic state and peopl for onli 5 such thing happen though the serb ar the strongest when thei ar alon and now we ar realli alon yulii vorontsov russian perman repres to the unit nation had been veri firm in hi attitud that the serb should not be bombard but after russia receiv financi help he said that the nato ultimatum could be us as a threat to the serb there is no reason why churkin should sai that the serb lie that thei sai on thing todai and anoth tomorrow we ar shock and astonish it is clear that a politician can be shrewd and us even li everi politician act like that secretari of state warren christoph sai on thing in the morn and a complet differ thing in the even why doe churkin blame us even if what he said is true if you take a look at the polit line drawn by serbian politician you can sai that it is veri consist and clear how could we deceiv mr churkin that much in on night and two dai he spent with us as if he were a saint and can therefor be shock all thi is veri transpar andjelkov were there differ dure the latest meet between un special envoi akashi serbian presid milosev and republ of srpska presid karadz regard the relat between the serbian presid and the presid of the republ of srspka plavsic i do not think that there were ani differ in the basic attitud there have been perman consult between the leadership of the republ of srpska and the serbian leadership but no decis have been taken i would like to point out that it is onli the republ of srpska that can decid the jahorina assembl prove the same thing when the vanc owen plan had to be decid on consult had preced it but the final decis wa taken by parliament or better said in a referendum it wa opposit to the attitud of the serbian leadership andjelkov there ar rumor about your disagr with milosev plavsic it is clear that my attitud which ar pure serbian nation attitud cannot compli with milosev s attitud he ha on pedigre i have a differ on i can listen to hi argument i commun well with peopl who have a differ opinion from mine but it seem that other cannot commun with me becaus i have a differ opinion i disagre with the previou regim the biggest problem wa that you had to think in the same wai as everybodi els that regim depriv the peopl of the possibl to express their opinion openli somebodi who support thing like that must be complet differ from me therefor i cannot think like mr milosev he is milosev and i am biljana plavsic it wa realli a low blow by milosev to manipul my quotat of a statement a wound soldier made in connect with the vanc owen plan in the follow wai there ar 12 million serb if 6 million die the other 6 million will live honestli it is a shame to manipul a statement like that and who is the person

sure know that i am a monarchist and i believ that everyth that can bring the serb who ar otherwis prone to divis togeth should be veri much cherish person i believ that a monarchi is on of those

polit success of vuk draskov can also be view in thi wai becaus mani peopl think that hi sometim lyric and romant sometim epic and rhetor speech ar not welcom in polit which requir more realiti although it seem that surrealist polit ar the most success in serbia what would the polit world look like if we were alwai realist depriv of certain natur color perhap like a feast in the form of a pill which might contain everyth but is tasteless those who have never heard of the good man from mancha don quixot who got himself into troubl when he decid to give up hi quiet life and becam a wander knight speak and write about vuk draskov without much understand ignja will all thi struggl of your pai do you think that you ar sometim tilt at windmil like the famou wander knight draskov the most profit thing for me would be not to get involv but write my book howev i do not think that i have the right to be so selfish there is no more import aim than to remov the present leadership to save the peopl and the state it is a difficult and unpleas task howev sometim it seem a vain job but we must be persist ignja some time after the elect it seem that the opposit had a chanc sinc the socialist parti the former communist did not have a major in parliament it came to a breakup within the opposit howev were you surpris draskov i would not be sincer if i said that i had been surpris in last year s elect campaign i warn opposit support that their vote for chang could be us against it i told them that there wa no risk onli if thei vote for depo or for the spo serbian renew movement ignja do you want to sai that mani peopl fell into a trap who set it draskov it wa notic that on of the opposit parti oppos everybodi and everyth even itself it did not onli oppos hatr and war but the spiritu and mental empti anoth opposit parti built it imag on hidden and half public date with the socialist parti but sinc it love wa not return it wa offend and express it feel by offer to flirt with pale a third opposit parti ha not even had a polit strategi of it own it plai the role of karadz s polit repres in serbia thi parti is practic the bureau of the srpska republ of bosnia herzegovina in belgrad ignja do you want to sai that these three opposit parti cheat the peopl who vote for them draskov peopl who vote for them wast their ballot the spo remain the onli consist democrat power of resist and hope it must be admit howev that we also had our kalab world war ii chetnik chieftain which is the onli thing that surpris me mihajlov s behavior is unbeliev it cannot be excus ignja ye i know but you have forgotten to sai which three opposit parti you ar refer to draskov if thei cannot be recogn base on what i said it is superflu to mention their name i am not against name these parti i just oppos their polit activ ignja i think that the democrat parti of serbia dss is a real opposit parti but that it will not meddl with the rule parti draskov perhap not with it but there is a rule parti on mount jahorina locat of bosnian serb assembl too thi is the leadership that ha disgrac us in front of the world for thi reason it is oppos by the spo but the dss approv of it god forbid that pale get the chanc to annex belgrad and serbia accord to them and accord to their repres in serbia their center is neither belgrad nor topola nor takovo but jahorina ignja why is your parti so close link to the new democraci parti draskov new democraci is on of the founder of depo thi parti obtain four seat in the 1992 elect three in the serbian assembl and on in the feder parliament i have to sai that there have been no problem whatsoev between the spo and the new democraci parliamentari member if you ar not acquaint with parliamentari issu you cannot tell which depo repres come from the spo and which from the new democraci parti the behavior of thi parti eas the pain inflict on depo by kostunica after he obtain 20 seat in parliament it wa the behavior of thi parti that made the spo hope that it effort to unit all the democrat and opposit power under on umbrella in the depo ar not all in vain ignja the depo umbrella howev began to leak dure the first rain to the delight of the socialist parti is all thi a coincid draskov there ar rumor that mihajlov attend a special cours where he wa prepar for betrai and break up depo thi is not true he wa blackmail he own a privat compani and the new democraci parti is noth but a chain of sever dozen larg and small privat compani peopl earn big monei by invest littl or no monei at all and when thei were face with the choic of either retain their compani which meant coalit with the socialist parti and joint govern with them or to stai loyal to the spo which would have meant the liquid of their compani and probabl a seri of arrest thei chose the first option ignja these ar perhap onli assumpt unfound suspicion draskov alreadi in januari 1994 the socialist parti leader prove to mihajlov that their threat were seriou in bor ignja as soon as bor is mention on must immedi think of tomidza sainov and sokolov junior draskov on of the new democraci leader bosko nicic wa arrest in bor he too had a privat compani he wa arrest although he wa not guilti and there were no reason for hi detent but the aim wa to give an exampl to the big boss of what would happen if he did not give in he gave in and nicic wa releas from prison on bail new democraci allegedli propos him as sokolov s deputi ignja the parti of privat entrepreneur want to have it man in the polic leadership pure grotesqu draskov the most import thing in all polic state is to be in the good grace of the polic and it boss ignja you want to form a govern of nation uniti and salvat you have not succeed in form a govern of nation uniti but you have achiev a govern of salvat peopl ar enter it in order to save their head draskov if you ar good and obedi you can have everi posit if your ar not you can end up in prison although you ar innoc you and your famili can even be murder and your compani destroi sicilian law ar effect here but thei cannot make the polit disgrac and betray commit by new democraci appear less tragic there ar businessmen in the spo too mani of our member have been confront with seriou threat for four year but none of them ha respond to ani of these threat yet nobodi ha given in ignja you want to enter the govern of nation uniti yourself ar not you try to convinc yourself now that the grape ar sour draskov the idea of nation uniti and of a govern of nation uniti wa born in the spo in 1990 we especi insist on it in the spring of 1991 after the demonstr on 9 march 1991 dure my first encount with milosev i remind him of that idea and told him that he wa late in accept our idea i insist on a consist implement of thi idea ignja thi mean draskov noth els than that the chief of state ha to respect the will of hi peopl milosev told me on that occas natur the opposit will get 12 out of 25 ministeri posit but it cannot count on the posit of the prime minist or minist of intern affair the presid wa veri gener in offer seven to eight ministeri post to the spo ignja the public wa not inform about the detail of thi agreement can you tell us more about it now that a lot of water ha gone under the bridg draskov ye i can i told milosev that the opposit should have a major in the govern sinc it won a major in the elect in term of both the number of vote and the number of seat in the assembl i ad that the offer to particip in the govern of nation uniti had to be submit to all parliamentari parti the presid frown and said that there wa no place for fascism and primitiv in the govern of nation uniti he probabl meant seselj s parti it wa your parti which promot thi fascism and primitiv the spo ha had a veri critic attitud toward it sinc it veri begin i said thi is not true milosev answer ad that thei had onli support certain patriot action organ by the radic parti but that thei had never been will to give seselj s parti ani ministeri posit although he had often ask for thi ignja you have to admit though that thei did not attack the radic parti until seselj start destroi their govern at the begin of last autumn draskov ye thi is true i went on to point out that 600 000 peopl vote for the radic parti a polit fact that cannot be ignor these voter have to be as respect as those who vote for the democrat parti of serbia but thi parti did not want to particip in negoti about the govern of nation uniti milosev wa happi to be abl to sai that he invit kostunica who howev refus to come he also ad that the radic parti wa invit too ignja he invit tomo nikol not seselj draskov thi doe not matter the radic parti refus the invit to cut a long stori short i insist on an opposit major in the govern i also want all parliamentari parti to be repres in the govern and a spo member to becom the chairman of the feder parliament but the serbian presid did not accept ani of these propos ignja can you repeat hi word draskov he wa astonish that i refus seven ministeri posit ignja i am not sure but it seem to me that the minist of intern affair is nowher as respect as in serbia draskov in polic state the minist of the polic is the whole govern in the negoti of which i have just spoken milosev did not even mention the possibl that the communist parti a minor parti led by hi wife that did not get a singl seat in parliament could be repres in the govern there follow talk with mr minic and mr zoran andjelkov and thei did not mention thi possibl either it is clear to me now that milosev and these gentlemen were veri skill in hide their strategi from me the stori about the govern of nation uniti wa onli on of their fals method to bring communist into the govern formal speak four of them ar communist but in fact all 30 of them ar thi mean that the communist parti is the rule parti sinc the socialist parti of serbia is the disguis branch offic of the communist ignja mira markov the communist parti leader recent propos that polit parti should not be activ dure thi crisi period draskov i have address thi issu in parliament the aim of thi propos is clear under the pretext of nation uniti all polit parti should be abolish except for the communist parti which mean that we would return to the on parti system ignja thi sound absurd draskov thei see polit as the theater of the absurd the strategist of thi evil intent ar not interest in the price that serbia will pai for it the embargo wa primarili introduc becaus of the tragic fact that serbia is the onli countri in europ that support the communist world and which insist on reviv the communist leadership in the kremlin the sanction will remain effect as long as the communist rule in serbia ignja i did not want to interrupt you as you were speak veri quickli i think that the opposit leader ar not awar of the role that thei have to plai some of them seem not to have recogn who their polit enemi is the serbian polit scene doe not look like that in england franc or germani where a polit rise or fall doe not chang the polit life on the whole we had communist rule for 50 year the opposit that is not abl to disassoci itself from thi system will disappear from the polit scene becaus former communist and present socialist ar obvious do everyth to preserv the socialist system in serbia serbia is still a socialist countri as the problem of ownership ha not been solv yet draskov the onli hope for serbia is a democrat opposit but the coalit between the socialist and the communist parti want to destroi thi hope through the obscur project of nation uniti thei do not care for the serbian peopl thei ar not interest in serbia the onli thing that thei ar interest in is to preserv their communist leadership ignja is it true that thei want to preserv yugoslavia draskov yugoslavia wa broken up by gener and offic member of the communist parti the stori about greater serbia enabl them to keep their posit at that time these peopl ar now preach a reviv of yugoslavia becaus thei think that the greater serbia stori is worn out apart from that mani peopl ar nostalg about the former yugoslavia destroy ar becom founder master of war ar becom master of peac thei might even support the restor of the austrian hungarian monarchi if thei thought that the communist parti could profit from it ignja the fear of commun which ha admittedli lost an ey alreadi ha start circul around all the serbian territori draskov the communist parti rule everywher from belgrad to knin milosev told me give us as mani peopl as possibl for the diplomat servic sinc it is horribl more than horribl he said that but he did not ask for anybodi although i accept the propos and wa readi to send the cleverest peopl to repres the cultur and spiritu heritag of our countri probabl the most import diplomat posit and thi is the posit of the head of the fry bureau in zagreb wa given to a communist parti member thi is a thorn not onli in our side but also in zagreb s ignja the chairman of the democrat parti state onc that the opposit did not have a man who could rival milosev in the elect he wa consequ prais by milosev that littl djindjic is not bad when you came out of milosev s offic you look more than happi you paid him two compliment charm and witti and he return by state that your behavior had improv late peopl almost start cry draskov he also gave me a good grade in behavior last autumn three month befor we met as far as my compliment ar concern i would pai them again i think that nobodi is as power and superior as an innoc victim i enter and left milosev s offic with the feel that my own power is superior to hi that is why i paid compliment to him apart from that he is realli a witti and charm head of state who look you in ey and tell you the joke that he ha no influenc whatsoev on the televis and that he doe not even watch televis ignja the democrat parti chairman goe even further and claim that anticommun in serbia doe not pai what doe pai should we wait for the vizier s eleph to die a natur death in 100 year draskov djindjic is perhap right when he sai that polit parti cannot profit from an anti communist attitud in a communist serbia domin by communist televis but the poverti in which we live thi prison is the best proof that serbia cannot profit from commun ignja will the opposit show enough merci to the peopl to those two third who did not vote for the communist to chang at least some import law although now after the betray by new democraci thi also seem to be imposs draskov if djindjic seselj kostunica and agoston do not realiz that all of us have to be on side in parliament in order to chang the law on televis the elect law and the law on elect list it is senseless to particip in ani futur elect we ar confront with the problem of the new democraci parti which ha join the other side and is now prevent us from chang these law there ar mani democrat in the new democraci presid and it main committe so i hope that these peopl will soon take over the parti and pull it out of it collabor with the communist ignja why have thei not been expel by the depo council draskov there is no depo council we us to have such a council in the begin in the meantim all the polit parti that us to be depo member have left the coalit onli the spo and new democraci have remain in depo thei were join by the citizen allianc in the last elect it is imposs to convok the depo council now ignja thi sound logic but how will you go into the next elect draskov the spo will probabl particip in the next elect as the spo we have us up all our reserv for turncoat ignja but thi will be a new situat is it riski sinc peopl have got us to depo draskov we can count on 800 000 voter but our aim is to break the 1 million vote barrier ignja the serbian opposit is onli interest in a major in parliament everyth els is a minor issu draskov the easiest wai to reach thi democrat major is to vote for the spo we do not reli either on the kremlin or on pale we reli on serbia ignja time pass and you could be consid the presidenti elect in three and a half year sinc milosev cannot be re elect draskov ye accord to the constitut milosev cannot be re elect he is alreadi the former presid unless he chang the constitut or the peopl ignja you have recent said and nice weather is come too some peopl for exampl the inform minist link thi to the struggl for polit power outsid parliament in the street will there be demonstr on of the constitut right and a democrat aspect of a state draskov of cours there will be demonstr there must be demostr the spring doe not break up the winter onli with the sun but also with rain and wind 
FBIS4-9633: bfn interview with krasimir karakachanov secretari of the intern macedonian revolutionari organ union of macedonian societi vmro smd by valeriya veleva place and date not given skopj cannot plai on our nerv indefinit excerpt mr karakachanov three year after our recognit of our western neighbor s independ ha bulgaria manag to state it prioriti in macedonia the former yugoslav republ of macedonia fyrom karakachanov macedonia itself should be a prioriti of our foreign polici not onli from a pure emot viewpoint three war were wage to liber macedonia in which bulgaria sacrif 200 000 peopl up to 1944 bulgarian foreign polici wa orient in the direct of macedonia join bulgaria the idea wa to unit the bulgarian territori in a singl state in the name of the bulgarian nation todai the realiti ar differ bulgaria ha no interest in new conflict in the balkan for the sake of macedonia and for thi reason our polici is aim at preserv the new state s sovereignti and territori integr if we look at the situat pure pragmat our shortest road to the adriat that is the sea rout to europ pass through macedonia and albania to develop thi rout would make us more independ and enabl us larg to elimin the excess effect of the aegean port on our economi greec is conduct an extrem emot polici regard macedonia and the embargo it impos provid no guarante that we mai not be elimin in the same wai in certain futur circumst were we to defend a thesi that greec doe not like from the polit viewpoint veri good relat between macedonia and bulgaria might counter the athen belgrad axi which ha tradition been aim against bulgaria form as far back as 1913 it exist to thi veri dai and it ha alwai tri to nullifi bulgaria s effort to becom a factor of influenc in the balkan veleva doe thi mean that part of the kei to our two state surviv is for them to combin their effort karakachanov if a democrat regim is establish in macedonia on with a sincer attitud toward bulgaria and if both countri conduct a common balkan polici thi would be of mutual interest threaten by greec and serbia at present macedonia is isol in addit on should not forget the claim of the consider albanian minor in macedonia it is no secret that certain circl in the albanian popul there ar work for the secess of western macedonia so you can see that macedonia itself ha an interest in have bulgaria as a good friend the two of them togeth can becom an influenti factor in the balkan veleva despit thi on cannot sai that the relat between us dure the last three year have been brilliant karakachanov there ar two reason for thi first the bulgarian politician either do not appreci these interest that bulgaria ha or thei ar not interest in them at the moment macedonia is rule by peopl who were in power in tito s time the same parti the same figur thei ar close to the belgrad regim not onli ideolog even after macedonia declar independ thei sought altern for restor yugoslavia accord to the izetbegov gligorov plan todai no on can deni thi see the weak of bulgaria s balkan polici certain macedonian politician ar permit themselv to behav quit arrogantli and provoc at time passag omit veleva what is your comment on the statement by zhan videnov leader of bulgarian socialist parti bsp that the recognit of macedonia wa a tactic step by the filip dimitrov govern and that the serbian danger is a myth dream up by bulgaria karakachanov thi is not the first time that zhan videnov ha made an overhasti statement about macedonia and vmro intern macedonian revolutionari organ thi show that either he ha not given up hi parti s internationalist complex or he is not familiar with the problem even if we suppos that the sd union of democrat forc recogn macedonia dure the presidenti elect campaign to win the vote of bulgarian with a nationalist frame of mind why did the bsp not do it why did it not win these dividend the big point is that bulgaria won dividend by recogn macedonia not who did it and for what reason our politician should final realiz that there must be a measur of ethic in polit if a macedonian question exist todai if a larg part of the macedonian popul is confus and doe not know it own histori and root thi is due onli to the stupid polici that bulgaria and videnov s own parti ha follow from the time of the war in 1946 thi parti commit an act without parallel even in other communist parti it forc a part of the bulgarian peopl to renounc their origin and the bulgarian state forgot about the bulgarian in vardar and aegean macedonia todai the recognit of macedonia ha restor the trust of mani peopl there in bulgaria it seem that videnov want to pai obeis to yugoslavia or to the new democraci parti in greec even now some circl within the bsp claim that some kind of macedonian nation is a realiti i ask myself is the bsp realli follow a nation polici that is adequ for the situat in the balkan look at the serbian press even now it talk about macedonia as if it were southern serbia promin serbian politician even milosev s own wife ar work to integr macedonia into serbia veleva macedonian presid kiro gligorov start hi visit to sofia todai the albanian head of state sali berisha will come after him and later miltiadi evert leader of the greek new democraci parti will visit us what can we expect from thi activ foreign polici that bulgarian presid zhelev is follow karakachanov the vmro smd intern macedonian revolutionari organ union of macedonian societi ha long agit for a more activ bulgarian polici in the balkan the meet between gligorov and zhelev should demonstr to the macedonian side onc and for all that bulgaria s intent ar onli good thi indic that bulgaria will continu to toler skopj s provoc and the unnecessari tension in the region sali berisha s visit is also a good sign for us as for the leader of the new democraci parti it is clear that we must rais the issu of the bulgarian in aegean macedonia if these visit ar onli reflect in
