befor i enter polit when i spoke to you my dear compatriot in the languag of a writer i quot churchil sai that the road we have chosen demand blood toil tear and sweat from all of us the world can be proud of estonia becaus everyth we have achiev in our 76 year ha been achiev with hard work and patienc sweat and toil but without a drop of blood be spill as is characterist of a law nation todai stand here befor you in thi histor hall i can assur you that our major difficulti ar behind us but that new trial await us these too we will overcom if we unit our forc and abil instead of fragment them if we soberli assess how much ha been done and how much is yet to be done and what is most import no matter how mani differ opinion there ar between our polit parti and in ourselv that the estonian s calm confid and friendli desir to cooper must rise abov all thi and unit us into a republ of estonia of which we can be proud 1 the estonian nation and it peopl the constitut adopt by referendum declar the steadfast will of the estonian peopl to safeguard and develop their nation a nation which is found on liberti justic and law a nation which defend intern and extern peac it would now be an appropri time to sai that cultur is polit and polit is cultur cultur is polit becaus it is primarili in cultur where the nation ident becom appar ident is a necessari element a substanc which is difficult to describ but from which nation ar born polit is cultur primarili becaus the ultim aim of polit is to defend the individu to assist the individu to determin and deepen the characterist of a person the primari characterist of a person is the phenomenon that a person doe not exist outsid a cultur the estonian peopl have therefor creat a nation for themselv the suprem power of the state is held by the peopl the state must secur the develop of all the peopl as well as the opportun of everi person for self fulfil the mechan for thi is determin by the constitut as the separ and balanc suprem bodi of state power the riigikogu the govern of the republ the court system with the presid of the republ as the balanc factor dure the last year the suprem bodi of state power have been form and have begun oper the riigikogu ha done an enorm amount of work and to date as we heard in the speech by the speaker of the riigikogu mr ulo nugi at the flag rais ceremoni thi morn the riigikogu ha adopt on fifth of the bodi of legisl and ha therefor creat a work legisl basi all the compon ar there but the total of thi is not yet a state at least not such a state which ha the usual characterist of european nation and so we ar confront by a paradox problem the estonian peopl who have been liber from a coloni yoke have more ideal more willing to sacrific in the name of freedom than the peopl of welfar state who lack our tragic histor experi despit thi there is an increas in a skeptic attitud toward the riigikogu and the govern demean law and order the polic in particular ha becom almost a competit the mental of the soviet era serf worker which we have thrown out via the door is now creep in through the window the attitud of it s the master s rope let it run loos citizen do not understand the balanc between their right and oblig at thi stage my dear compatriot we should ask is thi the wai to build the estonian nation 2 post communist nightmar let us try to soberli analyz the reason for thi problem my learn colleagu in the west see the reason for the collaps of the soviet totalitarian regim in the command economi thei sai thi system wa bias toward the armament industri of the soviet union and simpli collaps due to the excess burden thi simplifi explan is onli partial true rather it is complet erron the soviet totalitarian regim wa taken to the extrem it command not so much the economi but peopl abil to think the creativ of peopl the ceil for peopl s creativ wa determin by the low ceil of the politburo s think prowess the most tragic result of thi wa the complet and final liber of peopl the liber of peopl from their heaviest burden the oblig to think to make independ decis and to bear the respons of their decis in restor our nation and economi we must also simultan restor the citizen who think and voluntarili take respons becaus democraci can onli be base on such a citizen and onli a think citizen comprehend the unavoid danger of belittl the estonian nation econom success itself doe not guarante the secur of the nation and follow on from thi doe not guarante the continu exist of a state of the peopl their languag and cultur and therefor the continu exist of the world estonian societi is current resolv the problem of it own re organ a process that onli few western academ can appreci the transit to democraci and a free market economi is like a leap across a crevic the feet no longer rest on the steep cliff edg but thei have not yet land on the other side thi instant of unsupported thi moment thi frighten uncertainti ha brought about chaotic phenomena in our societi and if these tendenc persist thei could open a pandora s box 3 let s restor order i see crime as the prime domest threat perform in the theater begin at 5 pm becaus peopl ar afraid of walk on the street in the dark even dure daylight peopl ar afraid of walk in the park peopl ar afraid of countri road peopl ar afraid of a knock on their door estonian do not feel secur in their own countri thi is onli on step awai from a nostalg long for the past and of alien from the state when we prefer to peek out from behind the curtain in the even if

pleasur to be abl to speak to thi distinguish forum on a topic of concern to all of us name cooper and secur in the baltic sea region howev we in estonia believ that secur in our corner of the world is integr to european secur in a wider sens we ar at the frontier of democrat and free market think preval among our closest neighbour with whom we share a shorelin at the same time we share a border with a veri unstabl giant to the east the well known russian democrat yurii afanasyev express hi doubt about the giant s futur in yesterdai s herald tribun when he wrote that todai a struggl for power is under wai on order is leav and the other ha yet to arriv the nois of the time again resound as it did in 1917 in thi context sweden s prime minist carl bildt eloqu express the need for ad secur in thi our region in hi address to thi forum last novemb when he said and i quot it should be obviou that a pattern of develop in which all the nordic countri becom part of an emerg european union eu thu make the three baltic state part of it near abroad also in a pure geograph sens will strengthen secur throughout the baltic and north european area end of quot i could not agre more and would go a step further by submit to you that secur in the baltic sea region is a prerequisit both for stabil and for extend prosper in the whole of europ in make thi argument i will highlight three area of particular interest first our secur concern at home second recent domest and foreign polici develop in russia third the role of the baltic sea region in a transform europ and fourth the ongo transform of western econom polit and secur structur in estonia the highlight of the summer is usual st john s ev on the 24 of june a holidai which the teuton knight borrow and christian but which is actual deriv from the pagan celebr of the summer solstic thi year howev the highlight of the summer is like to fall on 31 august when the last occupi soldier is due to leav estonian soil we have reason to believ that thi will in fact happen despit russia s failur thu far to hand over a timet for the withdraw of the remain 2 700 troop the withdraw albeit reluctantli is continu slowli but sure and peopl all over estonia ar mark the dai remain on their calendar i do hope that despit the unreason and irrat stanc adopt by the russian deleg at the present round of negoti russia will abid by it intern commit to withdraw it troop when that happi dai arriv we believ our secur will be greatli enhanc howev even after the last activ servic soldier and offic ha left we will still have plenti of reason to be vigil on primari reason is the presenc in estonia of some 10 000 retir and reserv former soviet offic who were demobil befor august 20 1991 thi number is roughli five time the size of our own fledgl defens forc and these person tend to be gener young and vital men as thei did not retir becaus thei were too old but becaus thei were demobil with perhap a prospect of futur activ duti we have 50 40 and even 35 year old militari pension in estonia some of them serv in special unit and were train to take care of swedish leader should a war break out becaus we ar not assur of their loyalti to estonia their presenc repres a substanti domest secur concern for thi reason my govern ha taken a human but firm stand on the issu we have made substanti concess by allow all those demobil befor the reinstat of independ in 1991 to appli for resid permit a special interministeri commiss will consid these applic on a case by case basi needless to sai those who were demobil after august 1991 will not be permit to appli for resid permit otherwis everi singl uniform russian offic in estonia could take off hi uniform and retir without leav the countri germani for instanc would hardli toler the continu presenc in it eastern part of retir former soviet soldier on other worri as far as domest secur is concern is our border with russia the argument over whether the 1920 tartu peac treati remain in forc ar well known russia continu to control territori that by the term of that treati actual belong to estonia ani suggest by russia that estonia is the on claim territori is patent fals and demonstr a weak understand both of histori and of intern law i will speak later of our hope for intern mediat in thi question in the meantim howev the russian feder ha in recent week unilater begun demarc the administr control line that run between russia and estonia put up barb wire fenc and station sentinel at the line when nobodi realli quit know where thi line run thi we cannot accept it repres a unilater action that is in direct violat of the oblig undertaken by csce member state that allow for border chang onli as a result of bilater negoti solut we ar ask russia for an explan of thi action within the csce context but i wish to speak of pure practic border matter as well the line run between estonia and russia continu to be altogeth too porou allow the illeg transfer into estonia among other good of drug radioact metal and weapon not to mention refuge these contraband good and refuge ar gener destin for further transport to point west we ar grate to sweden for have alreadi help us beef up our border regim but clearli much more need to be done we especi need to improv coordin between the agenc in estonia and sweden that deal with these problem becaus as we all know suppli stem from demand and we have to tackl the demand end as well i turn now to my second point that is develop in russia and how thi affect our secur dure the last two month the campaign of accus and outright threat from russia ha spiral dramat to name just a few let us rememb russian presid bori yeltsin s new year s greet to hi peopl in which he said that in the new year russia would begin pai special attent to compatriot live abroad then came foreign minist andrei kozyrev s address to ci ambassador in moscow impli that the baltic state were part of the near abroad follow by sever bellicos statement by defens minist pavel grachev about how russia would not withdraw it troop on mondai 28 februari even on the ev of our current round of talk with russia with the russian deleg alreadi in tallinn and our own negoti team drive through the snowi countrysid to where the talk would be held the latest attempt at intimid wa file with press agenc thi wa a russian foreign ministri offici s statement that russia would not keep to the final withdraw date alreadi agre upon the exact word of thi statement wa tell it said and i quot that the alleg that russia ha pledg to withdraw it troop from estonia befor august 31st thi year ar unfound end of quot as you can imagin thi latest statement did not help start the current round of talk on a construct note not to mention that it repres yet anoth setback in the withdraw process neither doe the continu refus of russian offici to acknowledg estonia s occup in 1940 help to creat an atmospher of trust between our countri and peopl a new russian foreign ministri draft program introduc earli last month by russian foreign ministri deputi spokesman mikhail demurin mai explain some of these action thi detail draft program appear to be a comprehens plan to reinforc russia s state primari foreign polici goal of protect the interest of ethnic russian abroad to thi end the draft program forese the us of variou polit econom and sociocultur mean includ import benefit and bank assist for busi outsid russia that ar run or domin by ethnic russian and the establish of a power broadcast network to spread moscow s word in introduc the program demurin told report that the plan wa devis becaus and i quot diplomat measur ar not enough end of quot it seem to us that the draft program ha been compil in a hurri by a number of state agenc and ministri with veri differ mandat becaus the draft is uneven and at time even intern contradictori in it approach for instanc we all understand that ani state ha the right and duti to protect the interest of it citizen live abroad but the russian foreign ministri draft speak of protect it ethnic compatriot not citizen thi polici of differenti peopl by ethnic is a stanc which estonia doe not accept as civil behaviour but which paradox is a posit that russian offici often accus estonia of assum thi repres a danger to estonia it repres a danger to sweden and it repres a danger to europ the baltic sea region ha attain a far greater signific than it had for the past 70 year or inde sinc the hanseat period we ar again a major trade area a vital part of a new europ russia is again an open market trade is again flow through the baltic state to russia and from russia to the world transit to thi great market is of vital import to us and estonia as a trade nation want to do everyth in it power to improv on all our econom prospect the baltic sea ha the potenti of regain it role as a major free trade area that it occupi dure the hansa the council of baltic sea state wa call into be to respond to a new need for cooper in our area and i can tell you that it ha proven a great success onli last week did our region s transport minist meet in kaliningrad with the particip of that vital overmilitar region s offici to discuss the improv of transport network in the baltic sea area but thi new activ again chang our secur environ for trade can onli prosper in an atmospher of mutual trust of mutual respect we have to reconcil all our conflict interest to togeth becom an essenti an integr part of the prosper european famili for thi to happen howev all european countri have to accept european rule and that includ russia when the council of europ wa found follow the second world war it founder had a vision of a europ where everyon great and small wa equal for onli so could a safe futur be guarante for our contin we cannot allow for these principl to be discard now no countri can assum that it ha the right to bulli other to forc other to do it bid presid yeltsin s recent speech in the russian parliament is worri becaus it doe not accept these principl to quot yurii afanasyev again militari pressur ha forc yeltsin to revers himself on acquiesc to central and eastern european countri seek nato membership the new militari doctrin of assert interest in the near abroad is fuell more blatant attempt to subordin former soviet republ under the guis of protect russian speak peopl russia is support nation liber movement in countri that seek independ sometim the direct particip of russian troop is camouflag and present to the world as a peacekeep mission in an interethn conflict if we ar to allow that kind of behaviour we will denounc the action of those that found the council of europ if we ar to allow russian style peacekeep mission we will sure doom mani nation and we will jeopard the great futur which our unit europ and our unit baltic sea region could look toward a unit europ a democrat europ ladi and gentlemen cannot allow ani compromis to be made be thei in the requir for access to the council of europ or in the descript of peac keep mission with which sweden ha had ampl experi democraci is democraci is democraci and no compromis can be made howev while we wait and hope for russian leader to accept the rule of the council of europ we cannot sit idl in difficult time friend and partner ar need and i would like to mention the strong support we have receiv in bilater relat with our closest neighbour in the confus period follow russia s parliamentari elect sweden ha taken the lead in try to exert a moder influenc on russia at the same time reassur us that we will not be left alon thi present situat reaffirm the necess of nation state and region leader act and adopt respons when global and european structur fail to do so the swedish leadership ha found the courag to be an activ and lead player in the baltic game when multin organ have not been brave or focus enough to do so thi continu support ha not been onli bilater in natur howev our neighbour have also push hard to acceler our integr into those western structur that mai provid there is the will help to counterbal the crisi in the east as you know we have been strong advoc of establish region secur tabl within the csce framework and would like to inject an element of secur polici into the activ of the council of baltic sea state further afield we have sign the

that end ar in the process of establish a joint peacekeep battalion with our baltic neighbour i would take thi opportun to express our sincer gratitud to sweden norwai denmark finland and the unit kingdom for offer to help train thi fledgl battalion while express the hope that sweden and finland will also join the pfp to strengthen the nordic axi and to move toward an all european secur system anoth express of our grow integr with europ ar our ongo free trade negoti with the european union we hope to have a free trade agreement elimin all trade barrier and tariff in forc on januari 1 1995 and i am veri happi to note that the european council see us as associ member of the union in the near futur in thi connect i would mention that we strongli support and welcom sweden s membership in the eu not onli will membership bolster the swedish economi but it will further strengthen stockholm s alreadi strong role in the intern arena we hope to join sweden as a full member of the european union at the end of thi centuri howev when earlier speak about the problem intern structur face i had on particular process in mind the european stabil pact while the idea conceiv by french prime

expect to turn a profit for the first 10 year the possibl of put up a nuclear power plant should be analyz abov all from an econom point of view if the potenti profit is a mere two cent per kilowatt it will obvious not be worth the risk it would be a complet differ situat howev if the nuclear plant would enabl us to produc electr at half the previou cost on of the biggest burden imagin is a

develop industri countri where it is anticip to run at 3 percent for 1993 and 1994 estonia s inflat rate is kept high by continu chang in the proport of price and the steadi movement of price toward world price level thi process must also take in the normal of the popul s incom level i e cost of labor that is part of the wage price spiral which through increas product cost is caus the price to go up secondli it should be consid that the rapid drop in inflat up until now is due larg to obsolet technolog and low depreci cost make the normal renew of asset imposs not renew the asset at world market price howev will bring about a notic increas in the depreci level of asset and price of finish product thi is why in estonia s situat maximum suppress of inflat should not be the prime object as that would stretch out the period need for adapt to world market condit more feasibl would seem to be an econom polici that doe not put excess limit on price and incom increas in the open effect compet sector of the economi what is signific here is not the rate of inflat as such but make sure that the inflat remain on the suppli side the economi be open the payment balanc a balanc achiev between price proport and the level of incom in the close non compet sector of the economi and also that minimum wage and pension be in a social equit proport to the wage level of the open sector the kroon not to be revalu soon the popul s incom could also be rais without up the level of nomin wage but rather by a gradual revalu of the kroon thi would mean stabil for the price of domest product a drop in the price of import good and lower inflat or stop inflat altogeth in foreign trade too thi would increas both the cost of product for import and the demand for import good to do that on would first have to give up us a fix rate of exchang thi could to be sure reduc confid in the estonian kroon and protect the exchang rate of the kroon mai prove to be difficult for bank of estonia at the same time it would give a certain freedom of movement in case there ar ani signific chang in the german economi and the kroon link to the german mark will be revalu excess or devalu for that matter right now these possibl ar legal rule out secondli implement of the entir econom polici would be concentr in the hand of bank of estonia by determin the exchang rate it would be implement both price and incom polici and the role of the price offic in regul price would be reduc also chang would be the role of the social servic ministri in formul the incom polici good pension law wage scale tax rate etc would in the case of stabl price and wage stai in effect for a long time without chang even if transit from a fix exchang rate to a period adjust fix rate for exampl mai some dai be necessari it is not expect to take place within the next two year first the pariti reserv of the kroon s purchas power is suffici to hold out for a coupl of year which even at project rate of inflat will guarante a purchas power higher than the exchang rate secondli it is not like that the current govern of politician and the govern coalit set the tone at riigikogu would give that much of a mandat to bank of estonia to control and direct the economi obvious the govern is not will to limit itself to fiscal polici make and turn the entir monetari polici over to the central bank as is the custom among classic market economi balanc of payment neg for 1995 for the balanc of payment a growth in the trade deficit is project even though export ar grow significantli thei also gener addit incom that creat a demand for import as the import increas the trade balanc will remain neg despit the growth of export the balanc of servic ha been posit so far and is like to remain so in the futur it is

estonia need anywher from 85 000 to 90 000 tonn of eat wheat a year that provid that the million and a half peopl live here consum 67 000 to 70 000 tonn of white bread 123 gram per person per dai 5 000 to 6 000 tonn of macaroni and 1 500 to 2 000 tonn of farina we consum 235 to 250 tonn of wheat a dai the stock ar be deplet daili and need to be replenish right now it is not realli import how big the state s total wheat reserv is we know the amount in the state s silo what is import howev is that all of estonia s baker confection and other involv in bake bui their flour from our miller and that these miller in turn bui the good wheat grown by our farmer unless of cours the miller and baker prefer to bui foreign flour the determin factor here of cours ar the qualiti and the price of grain and flour qualiti of grain can estonia s grain grower produc the kind of wheat that make for good white bread i think that most of them can over the past few year scientif and experiment facil have studi the combat of our own and foreign breed of wheat especi those from the nordic countri with estonia s climact and soil condit seed for prefer breed of wheat have been bought and also receiv as aid instruct ha been made avail to those who have request it the grow of wheat ha also made progress in 1993 the yield per hectar wa roughli 2 5 time bigger than it wa in 1989 while the total yield over the same period is down by on third last year s result show that even in poor weather condit the grain grower manag to turn out a good crop of wheat accord to the center for test the qualiti of grain the wet gluten content wa 23 percent or more that meet the requir of high qualiti wheat for 40 percent of winter wheat and for 85 percent of summer wheat a shed rate of 180 or more wa note for 70 percent of summer wheat and 80 percent of winter wheat lot the requir of high qualiti eat wheat were met by roughli 60 percent of the summer wheat and 30 percent of the winter wheat yield or by volum somewher between 36 000 and 40 000 tonn not includ seed and that i repeat in a year unfavor to wheat the highest gluten content wa note for a breed call heta 29 percent 32 percent for 1991 and 37 percent for 1992 wheat with a wet gluten content of 28 percent or more is consid to be extra high qualiti the plant area of heta made up two fifth of the total plant area for summer wheat figur ar free of emot and indic our actual potenti with the right select of breed and proper technolog method we can even grow wheat for make macaroni the price of grain it is hard to predict where the world price for qualiti wheat will be by fall accord to the first issu of agrarwirtschaft for 1993 volum price of soft wheat were 143 a tonn at the port of western europ between septemb and novemb of 1992 depend on grain qualiti lot size and seller the price vari up to two time includ the cost of transport at 13 a tonn the averag price of import soft wheat at the port of tallinn is at about 155 or 2 128 kroon a tonn what will be the cost of wheat to the produc thi year most like between 1 300 and 1 400 kroon a tonn expert estim no doubt there ar big differ between produc if we purchas all the weed and pest control materi fertil fuel and lubric which will make up close to 40 percent of the product price then we would have to spend between 45 and 50 million kroon to import all of the wheat at averag price howev would call for spend somewher between 180 and 190 million kroon should we be import product resourc or grain undoubtedli there ar import who bring in wheat below the averag price but that doe not necessarili mean that white bread made out of thi is ani cheaper nor do we know much about the qualiti of the wheat be import i as a tax payer and an ordinari consum of white bread have yet to notic ani stabil of price onli escal i dare sai that the wheat brought in by wai of aid in 1992 wa of lower qualiti and with a lower gluten content in summari as long as neighbor countri and super state have law or other legal measur regul the grain market estonia s grain market would also have to be protect by similar legisl in 1992 the total of wheat plant wa 2 7 time that of the 1989 total the amount of summer wheat plant last spring wa the same as it wa a year ago while the winter wheat plant in the fall wa less than half of that that indic that our grain market wa not function effect and that our grain trade is poorli organ in countri with a normal market economi long term contract ar in place between the grower of grain miller and baker thi creat a feel of secur for all concern even for tomorrow it is time for us too to start negoti agreement and be done with that by the time spring plant start in on year we have consum the amount of wheat it took us two year to grow the plant area of winter wheat ha diminish and whatev wa left suffer damag dure the winter wheat reserv ar not infinit how about plant more summer wheat in the spring we should have enough
