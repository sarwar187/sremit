sleev to take respons and to ensur that thi great countri becom realli great and i have no doubt that if we work togeth we will be abl to build a veri great countri inde venter mr mandela you talk about the realiz of the dream and if i mai i d like to narrow it down to on specif moment now yesterdai most of south africa saw archbishop desmond tutu cast hi vote and veri solemnli he put hi ballot into the ballot box and onc he had done so he wa unabl to restrain himself from burst into a jig danc a jig of joi now perhap peopl would have been surpris to see you do the same howev it must have

moment mandela well as i sai thei were mix feel thei were feel of joi of happi a sens of accomplish we have fought throughout for a south africa where the merit of a person is the determin factor i

a govern of nation uniti which is a guarante that we will be work for the interest of all south african not just the major and it wa a moment occas and perhap my feel ar beyond word venter mr mandela if i mai just follow up on that issu of reconcili you know you chose as a titl for the descript of the part of your life up until now no easi walk to freedom look at reconcili do you think that the next chapter might be entitl no easi walk to reconcili mandela well i do not think so everi human be want peac want secur for himself for hi famili for hi grandchildren peopl love peac and i believ that those who fear democraci in thi countri who would like to derail the construct purpos which mani south african have made ar in a tini minor i don t think it s go go be so difficult to promot the spirit of reconcili we for exampl have alreadi said that those member of the secur forc who commit polit and relat offens befor the 8th of octob ar entitl to indemn just as the freedom fighter who fought against apartheid were given an indemn the onli issu which we have emphas is that the freedom fighter were ask to disclos what offens thei have commit we would like also the defend of apartheid to disclos what offens thei have commit not becaus we want to punish them for those offens but becaus the indemn is go to word indistinct on an individu basi we ar do thi becaus we ar keen that the south african polic the south african defens forc must be part of thi transform without their cooper it will be difficult for us to get that stabil wherebi we can promot the spirit of reconcili and nation build pinda mr mandela if we could look ahead now to the next step the world is watch south africa s elect and million of black south african who have never befor vote ar eagerli await the result and we must look i think at the valid of that result you had some harsh word yesterdai you talk of sabotag of the process can you perhap explain a littl bit more about that and whether you think that inde the result will be valid will be legitim whether we have had a free and fair elect mandela well firstli it must be clear that when i spoke about a massiv sabotag i wa not at all refer to the independ elect commiss that commiss is compos of men and women of the highest integr almost all of them ar known to me person and i work with them in other capac and i am convinc about their imparti their integr in thi exercis but wai down there someth wrong ha happen you will have notic that in white area indian and color there wa no problem about ballot paper arriv in time no problem about the elect take place smoothli it is onli in african area especi area which ar the stronghold of the anc that these problem have arisen i spoke yesterdai to gener holomisa he said to me that thei were alloc 2 million ballot paper thei onli receiv yesterdai onli 250 000 he said thei had been promis that more ballot paper would come at 1 o clock yesterdai thei were told later that thei will come at 6 o clock we ar have the same thing in the northern transvaal later dure the dai we were told that these ballot paper had arriv in pietersburg and in thohoyand but in a big area like that countri area where there ar no commun the arriv of ballot paper in pietersburg mean noth it s just the start of the process the crunch is go to lie in distribut those ballot paper it mai take a dai and even two dai befor thei reach some of these poll station so there is thi unaccount discrep between white indian and color area and african area nevertheless in spite of that i think that thi is a problem which is be address i m meet mr de klerk todai at 2 o clock to address these question the will is there to address these irregular and i think that is more import that concentr on the mistak that have been made and i m therefor confid that we ll be abl to pronounc thi elect ha have be free and fair nyako mr mandela i d like to take you back a littl you spoke here about the willing for reconcili and prospect of a bright futur but onli yesterdai the right wing said it is declar war as from next week everybodi in the countri must know that there is a war what ar your comment to the comment by the awb afrikan resist movement mandela well we can t stop peopl from make ani statement which pleas them i don t think the awb is in a posit to conduct ani war the eas with which the polic have made a breakthrough arrest everyon of these bomber i think alreadi we have defus the situat in a matter of hour and i don t regard the threat by the awb as someth we should worri about we ar build the countri we ar promot thi spirit of nation reconcili our slogan is and i have carri thi to almost everi meet i ve address let the past be the past let bygon be bygon let us promot thi spirit of reconcili let everi south african irrespect of hi color know that thi is hi countri and be involv in the process of transform i regard it as signific that a person like gener constand viljoen should have made a statement more than onc to sai thei have found more sincer and made greater progress with the anc than with the nation parti he is do that becaus of the correct of our polici the impact it is make in the countri and in sai so i do not minim the role that ha been plai by other polit organ gener and the np in particular what wa origin the initi of a particular organ the result is that it is a collect on that all of us have contribut to thi outstand breakthrough that we have achiev in thi countri that is what is import not the threat by the awb venter mr mandela you speak about the 31 arrest and that of cours is an illustr of what is be done to deal with and tackl that particular problem that safako rais right now you also sai that the belliger statement ar someth that shouldn t necessarili be worri about howev it is a matter that doe worri south african what is the prospect what li down the road now if you look down the road particularli from the perspect that there s at least an excel chanc that you will be in the presid s offic in a matter of dai how do you weight thi up and when you look down the road what do you see as the futur of thi problem of white resist mandela we must rememb that the np wa onc in exactli the same posit todai as the right wing as the awb thei us everyth in their power to destroi the liber movement thei shot and kill freedom fighter right from 1960 befor we ever thought of the conflict between inkatha freedom parti and the anc freedom fighter di in the hand of the south african polic but through discuss we have been abl to move the np from that posit to a posit where now thei ar our friend and with whom we ar try to promot the spirit of nation reconcili and to build a greater countri it is partli as a result of the discuss which we ve had with the afrikan volksfront nation front gen constand viljoen ferdi hartzenberg dri bruwer that gen constand viljoen ha join thi process we ar go to continu with that process i have had discuss with ferdi hartzenberg formal and inform on a on on on basi i propos to continu with that let me indic to you that there is not a singl organ not a singl opinion maker as an organ among the afrikan that i have not seen i have seen a wide rang of such organ the gener all the gener that ar respons for polici in the south african polic the full gener staff of the sadf i have seen twice the full leadership of the dutch reform church i have seen the leadership of the broederbond secret afrikan brotherhood the vryheidstigt freedom foundat of professor carel boshoff i have travel all the wai to bothavil to see the nation maiz produc organ and all the variou agricultur union in thi countri i have done so becaus it is absolut necessari for us to speak with on voic on all the major nation question in thi countri and we re succeed the awb ha becom a small isol organ even among the afrikan thei ar not in a posit to carri out ani threat it can never be more than a simpl polic act in which the govern is not even involv that is the extent to which we have neutral that fring of peopl who think through their blood instead of think through their brain i think that we have succeed in isol them i don t think it s an issu over which to worri and if thei ar readi to speak to me i will sit down and discuss with them i have alreadi had discuss with some of them and those discuss have been fairli interest and fruit if their leader want to sit down and discuss with me i m avail i will discuss with him but i think that the polic will be quit suffici in deal with them we don t even need the sadf to deal with the awb pinda mr mandela probabl more import than even the problem of the white minor in that respect is the relationship obvious between the african nation congress and the inkatha freedom parti and the follow on the ground and the troubl that ha arisen from that can you give us some idea how you will address that issu will the view as everybodi seem to expect from pretoria give you a fresh perspect or ani fresh think on that issu mandela well you will have notic that there ha been ongo discuss between the african nation congress and the inkatha freedom parti we propos to continu with dialogu with everybodi includ the inkatha freedom parti we propos to continu that even after a govern of nation uniti ha been establish dialogu is the most import weapon and it is becaus we have us that weapon that we have made thi progress you must rememb that at on time we had no less than 26 polit parti pull in differ direct nevertheless we have made breakthrough we have establish a transit execut council we have adopt a nonraci constitut which howev flaw becaus of the compromis which we had to make to accommod the view of differ polit parti it is flaw but nevertheless it reflect the hope and aspir of all south african then we had todai a dai of liber that wa what is import and we have made enorm progress and i don t think we ar go to have ani difficulti in entrench thi spirit of reconcili and nation build in which all south african ar work togeth venter mr mandela if i can just follow up on that becaus the elect ha been remark for mani thing but thi word indistinct is sort of a subsidiari miracl name that there is contrari to all expect an almost total absenc of violenc i wa sit on the new desk for the last two dai and be inund with report sai there is no new there s no violenc here the minor incid of intimid report sai that farmer ar involv in right wing activ for exampl in the town of viljoenskroon assist their worker to come to the poll to vote anc and ifp support stand in the same queue in east rand township now south african ar almost all afraid to ask the question is thi the seed of that reconcili a perman plant of that reconcili that you re talk of mandela i think the messag ha gone across of reconcili men and women in everi countri thei want peac thei want secur thei want econom and polit stabil thei want to predict what is go to happen in the futur unless you have peac it is imposs for us to carri out our best program of action and i think the spirit ha gone across of reconcili that messag ha been corrod the support of those who fear democraci who want to block thi process some of them have come in becaus thei realiz that if thei continu to stand out thei will be written out of histori that messag of reconcili is alreadi respons for what is happen yesterdai the dai befor yesterdai in these elect it is becaus the peopl can see that the major polit organ ar commit to peac we have made it clear i made it clear in the rivonia trial that i have fought against white domin just as much as i have fought against black domin i have stood for that idea i have been firm in the belief that south africa is on countri on nation whether you re color white indian or african i think that messag ha gone across and therefor what we see in these elect is alreadi the result of thi environ of reconcili that we ar promot venter mr mandela i d just like to apolog to our viewer for the difficulti we ar experienc with light and i hope the content of our discuss doesn t leav our viewer in the dark nyako mr mandela we have heard mani stori of you know touch moment that peopl went through dure the elect i rememb interview somebodi just to find out how she felt by cast her vote she wa speechless she couldn t sai a word you ve heard how maid and madam embrac cry sai now you re part of on famili can you just mayb tell us what ha been the most touch moment in the whole elect mandela well i think it is veri difficult to identifi ani singl moment which i can regard as touch but the veri fact that our peopl the injur the disabl have had the opportun to exercis on of the most import right which a citizen ha ha been most touch and the fact that as you have said thi elect proceed without violenc all these have been touch moment but within that context i don t think it is possibl to sai thi singl issu ha touch me most the whole develop that ha taken place ha been veri touch inde pinda mr mandela can i just ask you how do you think you ve done you ve spent your life fight for thi elect have you won it mandela well what is import is not the victori of ani particular individu or organ it is the victori by the peopl of south africa that is what should domin all of us and i think that everyon of us will agre that the peopl of south africa have been victori thei have won venter mr mandela within a number of dai the first cabinet meet of the new govern will take place and you ll certainli be occupi on of the chair at that tabl what would you like to be the primari agenda point at that first decis execut meet of the new govern mandela well first everi leader should take respons for build the mutual trust that should exist if we re go to be in a posit to address the major nation issu face thi countri dure thi elect when deal with the disrupt of polit meet of our oppon i have urg my comrad that we must not open up wound now which will be difficult for us to heal when we work as a govern of nation uniti that these same oppon ar go to be our partner whatev we do we should be influenc by that consider so the task of build thi mutual trust among ourselv is go to be on of the most import prioriti becaus unless we ar abl to speak with on voic even though we mai differ on specif issu which happen in ani organ in ani famili unless we promot thi spirit of mutual trust it is go to be difficult for us to face the problem of the countri i think that thi will be on of our task but we have thi reconstruct and develop program we have been veri care in ensur that it is circul veri wide among busi academ state depart state corpor for comment we have had no less than five

mandela let me first clear up on report that i am go to rais tax that i am go to tax white i don t know where thei pick up that statement if there is anyth i am consciou about it is not to frighten the minor especi the white minor what i said is that everybodi must pai a fair tax secondli we want a low tax rate to attract invest both local and from abroad that is what i stress and i do that in order to achiev stabil in our countri if you singl out a particular commun you ar creat instabl to establish stabil in thi countri is not a great problem the onli peopl who can creat instabl ar the

violenc that come in our econom polici the reconstruct and develop plan for exampl there is not a singl refer to thing like nationalis and thi is not accident there is not a singl slogan that will

veri frankli and we took down their critic and accommod them we ar now plan a second meet with them becaus we ar concern that we should put befor the countri a plan which embrac the concern and the

the world bank the intern monetari fund commerci bank and industri organis to sai we ar build a new countri we want your assist with resourc we can never get the support of busi if we ar go to have

radic left polici with the except perhap of the pac that is intend to bring about stabil so we can face ani threat to stabil there ar peopl who threaten violenc like inkatha and the awb afrikan resist movement but we ar have discuss with inkatha and with the king and we ar not go to allow them do thing which aris out of the fact that there is no contact between the govern of nation uniti and inkatha we ar go to press them to keep within the process and to particip as far as possibl there have been suggest that mr de klerk will be assign mainli a ceremoni role as deputi presid is that true mandela no no no he will have the full power of a deputi presid except that he will be the second deputi presid we have had differ as you know but i still regard him as a man of integr who ha made a valuabl contribut i have hammer him onli on on point hi lack of candour as far as the exist of a third forc is concern and allow our peopl to be slaughter thi is the onli reason i have clash with him otherwis i valu hi contribut and i think it will be proper for a govern of nation uniti to recognis that contribut if he get five percent and if he come in as the second strongest parti he certainli will be us becaus he ha had experi of govern although hi govern wa illegitim and discredit he ha had experi as we understand hi posit if he get four or five seat in cabinet he would want on cabinet seat in each of three categori secur financ and social ar you happi with that formula mandela i have not heard that rumour but i have said that i am interest in stabil in thi countri and it is go to be necessari for us to ensur thi stabil by the cabinet appoint we make but i have not yet discuss these matter with my organis would you keep dr stal at the reserv bank mandela i would recommend that what about amnesti will an extend amnesti be secret will we never know who commit what crime mandela you know that oppon of apartheid were grant indemn provid thei made applic and disclos the crime for which thei were appli the question is whether the secur forc must get the same treatment we want the support of the secur forc the polic and the armi but their moral is veri low thei ar concern about the commiss for truth that it will lead to a kind of nuremburg trial the anc must take the lead in remov the lack of moral we will depend on the sap south african polic and we must rememb that there ar 100 000 policemen onli a small number of them ar guilti of these kind of crime that is why we ar look at an amnesti after disclosur of cours there will be no amnesti for crime commit after decemb 1993 after stabil when thing settl down you will have to deal with expect what ar your three top prioriti mandela we have spell out our prioriti the creation of 2 5 million job the build of on million home free and univers educ these ar the central issu in that order but thi doe not mean that we will ignor other need there is natur also the question of peac will you disarm the nation

as well as a polit event the elect wa in itself an act of concili how do you build on that mandela the question of concili is on of the most import thi messag must go across veri clearli and i hope that everi leader will realis how import it is for us not onli to preach but to take some concret step to ensur reconcili the question of indemn for exampl is part of that concili the fact that we

two forc which have been of particular relev in the histori of our countri we ar awar of the type of govern we have had sinc 1912 which reli on brute forc and coercion the mani decad of that coercion onli serv to produc the mbeki the sisulu the joe slovo the brahm fisher the dadoo the nicker the trevor manuel and thei have becom nation hero todai and some of them ar now hold cabinet post thei prevail after a lot of bitter had been creat and it is as a result of that polici that deep wound have been creat in our countri coercion brute forc impati the inabl to sit down with your countrymen and to talk had the hand in anoth forc that of compass that of love and loyalti to your countri that of ignor what is neg in a human be and concentr on that which is good through dialogu through persuas we have been abl to bring south africa out of that era of dark bitter pessim to a moment where the entir world ha join us to come and celebr that is a lesson not just for thi dai it is a lesson on which we can build for the futur perhap it wa fortun that we had thi era becaus we ar now abl to appreci the sacrific that have been made by the sisulu and the mbeki and the other we now know the calib of the men and women of south africa south africa is rich and not onli in natur wealth and gold it is rich in the calib of it men and women we appreci that and we have come to appreci more becaus of the struggl that thei have put forward but there is anoth aspect from the opposit direct among those who have been produc by apartheid there have been men and women with a vision who realiz that human be ar human be i spent so mani year in prison you will be surpris to know the friendship the strong friendship which were built between black prison and white warder it wa difficult for the polici maker to persecut us as thei want becaus we becam friend with the warder in our passag it is through them that we could be persecut and the firm friendship we form were itself a protect i don t know whether my friend ar here i invit three of the warder who look after me to attend these celebr i invit them i invit them to come or rather i ask the committe that is arrang to invit them to come becaus i want them to share in the joi that have eman spontan around thi dai becaus in a wai thei also contribut to it then of cours there is my friend mr de klerk he had he wa on of those who gave us a hard time the late dr dani craven the chairman of the south african rugbi board and dr luyt the chairman i think of the southern transvaal rugbi board thei went to harar to see the anc becaus thei realiz that south african rugbi could not go back to intern sport without go through the anc thei knew that the kei to intern rugbi wa anc thei did a good thing it wa good for them thei had foresight thei suppress all their prejudic and realiz that thi is the organ that would help them when thei came back thei were chastis by mr de klerk for have had discuss with a terrorist organ now i mention thi as a measur of the chang here undergon the person courag the vision the honesti the integr with which he came to examin the situat in south africa and us hi enorm power as the head of the govern to bring about reform so we have forgotten the past we must know the past so that when we work togeth now in a govern of nation uniti we must know precis what we have come through what we should avoid we said a lot of unkind thing about on anoth dure the elect laughter but we have fought the elect we have had a good fight now it is the time for us to put togeth the broken piec of our countri and to ensur that our peopl speak with on voic we feel that becaus of the mani year of discuss we have had befor i wa releas from jail i had meet with them sentenc as heard we discuss the situat togeth and then dure these four year we have exchang on a wide varieti of veri sensit issu when our own team could not agre we sat down togeth and exchang view i took him into confid about some of the problem that i had he took me in confid about the problem that he had and we work as a team behind the scene applaus and we were abl to keep togeth at on time 26 polit parti with differ background pull in differ direct todai is the result of that other forc in our countri that of persuas that of discuss that of dialogu that of love and loyalti to our common fatherland now in the dai to come thi is the forc on which we ar go to reli we ar still go to have mani problem becaus when mr de klerk talk about a democraci sometim he doesn t mean the same thing which i understand about democraci laughter and when our own peopl when we talk about a govern of nation uniti which now must fight for reconcili for nation build thei don t understand the same thing which he understand sometim we don t understand the same thing which i understand laughter so the govern of nation uniti ha to face all these problem but i have no doubt that we have men and women in thi countri from all section of the popul who will rise to the challeng there ar mani american here perhap let me repeat what i have said in their absenc becaus thi come from an american who is aliv todai and those who have been with me in the meet i have address must plug their ear becaus thei will be bore to hear thi again some american ha said a person who doe what all other can do is an ordinari person a person who doe what no other person can do is except but a person who doe what no other person ha ever done is a nation asset is a geniu is an institut south africa todai want men and women who strive to do

also have got the support of the mass of the peopl and opinion maker in the countri becaus of our differ approach as compar to the previou govern where we reli on consult with the peopl of south africa mashokw mr presid you touch on the issu of amnesti for crimin violenc commit in the further of polit object doe thi in ani wai suggest that you ar go to extend the deadlin for crimin violenc which will probabl mean that janu walu clive derbi lewi will be given amnesti as well mandela well firstli let s take the posit veri clearli there ar three categori of peopl in regard to whom amnesti mai be consid there ar those peopl who commit offens befor the 10th of octob 1990 those we have decid that provid thei follow a certain procedur thei ar entitl to amnesti becaus there ar similar categori of peopl befor that cut off date who were grant amnesti and we believ that a govern of nation uniti should be even hand and grant amnesti not onli to those who commit offens in their opposit to apartheid but also to those who commit offens in defens of apartheid but then there ar those who commit offens between thi cutoff date and decemb 1993 their indemn or amnesti is pure at the discret of the govern of nation uniti but those who commit offens after decemb 1993 we have no polici at the present moment we have no decis at the present moment as to whether thei will be grant amnesti but i must sai that our intent is to heal the wound and to ensur that there is peac in our countri that everybodi cooper in the task of reconcili and nation build but case will be examin on their merit you must rememb that in the case of peopl like walu and derbi lewi thei ar peopl who lost their belov in a veri cruel manner in a manner which could have led to civil war in thi countri and their case therefor is go to requir special consider we as the african nation congress have openli declar that we ar against the death sentenc and of cours that is an offens that wa commit befor we took over the govern of the countri we will have to balanc up issu in the light of our polici but also in the light of the special natur of their offens bear in mind the peopl who have lost their belov and a countri which ha lost on of the most promis leader in thi countri so the question of these two is on that will have to be decid on it own fact akhalwaya mr presid can we talk about the peopl outsid prison who ar still in prison to a larg extent as heard your speech emphas todai the develop of youth and the central role that youth plai in the rdp and also the question of the emancip of women you have also announc special feed scheme for children in need of feed you ve also talk about free medic care for children under the ag of six while everybodi applaud quit rightli the emphasi on youth there ar million of peopl in thi countri who were depriv of their youth through the struggl i m talk now about pension that there is no similar concess be extend to them in term of your speech now sure in term of the difficulti thei ar undergo queu for long hour just to collect pension for medic treatment and so forth that similar concess should be extend to them mandela there ar mani issu of import in thi countri which were not mention in thi speech not becaus thei ar not import but becaus other polici had been made clear in countless speech befor todai the question of pension is on to which we ar commit to honor a person who take up a job and contribut to the pension fund want to prepar for a dai when he or she is no longer abl to work and no govern can ignor the payment of pension to which peopl ar legitim entitl akhalwaya i ask specif about the pension not be abl to get free medic treatment as children would be entitl to mandela well we ar develop a social program in which peopl who ar not abl to afford to pai for medic expens will be entitl to do so we have mention the question of children specif becaus it is part of our polici but we have spoken about the disabl about the ag be entitl to assist form the govern thi includ pension as well we have made no discrimin whatsoev against pension mashokw mr presid what about pariti for pension and pension for the civil servant who have been work in these homeland and independ state will the govern find monei to equal the packag that thei ar look for mandela pariti is a principl to which we ar commit and we have to find the resourc to put the polici in practic akhalwaya if i mai just come back on the question of fund the rdp and the financ that ar requir there s also the question of taxat obvious it will be on of the sourc of revenu in your speech and i just quot you said that we agre that a perman higher gener level of taxat is to be avoid is that sort of code word perman or doe that mean that you ar consid temporari higher tax and if so isn t temporari part of the govern plan still out to continu temporari for a long time as heard mandela i m happi we have move awai from pension becaus i wa begin to get the impress that you ar concern about your own pension laughter now our polici is that we should have a low taxat system that is our polici and it is absolut import in order to get invest both local and foreign and that is why we ar commit to the system of a low taxat system we don t know of cours about the futur we will resist ani temptat to fund the govern by rais the rate of taxat and that formul is mere intend for the chang thought should it becom necessari becaus of concret condit to consid rais tax even when we do so there will be the widest consult with the peopl who will be expect to pai a higher taxat we will refrain from take ani unilater action but as present advis i cannot imagin a case where it will be necessari for us to rais taxat mashokw mr presid let s go beyond the border south africa go back to the famili of nation where is your focu go to be southern africa in africa the un and ar we go back as you state to the commonwealth what is in it for us mandela you can t approach thi question from the point of view of priorit we ar in the southern african region and of cours we have to plai our role there we have advantag as far as our economi and financi system is concern which ar not enjoi by our neighbor and we will plai our part as equal partner with organ like sadc southern african develop commun we ar part of the contin of africa and we have now been accept by the oau we will plai our part in that region and on thi contin but at the same time we ar go to be part of an organ the commonwealth which draw it membership from all over the world we will be part of the non align movement which also ha got a similar composit we will be part of the unit nation a world bodi and it s not possibl to sai we attach more import to thi particular organ insofar as the question of our membership is concern and our activ thei ar all on the same basi akhalwaya presid mandela tomorrow is africa dai and the unit nation will be lift the arm embargo on south africa now armscor armament corpor of south africa in thi countri ha form as a result of the arm sanction accord to report armscor is now gear up to tackl the intern market to sell south african arm abroad given our own histori given what is happen in our own countri in term of violenc the indiscrimin us of firearm firearm be obtain freeli ar we gear ourselv up as a nation that perhap should know better that we want to export weapon of death and destruct abroad mandela the trade in arm is worldwid and i don t think it will be fair to sai that a particular countri should not engag in trade in arm after all arm ar not provid for the purpos of suppress of a particular popul group in a countri arm ar for the purpos of defend the sovereignti and the integr of a countri from that angl there is noth wrong in have trade in arm but we ar go to look veri carefulli in so far as our own countri to be sure that our trade in arm doe not violat consider of human and doe not allow ani particular countri to us those arm for suppress the legitim aspir of ani ethnic group in that particular countri mashokw mr presid you refer to south africa s contribut to world peac and word indistinct about rwanda and angola ar there ani specif that you could give with effect to what contribut south africa is go to be plai in those two countri mandela we ar part or we ar go to be part of the organ of african uniti and we ar go to form part of the frontlin state and our contribut will be determin collect by ourselv as well as the organ i have refer to we have no unilater polici in thi regard it is suffici for us to declar that as a matter of principl we ar interest in peac throughout the world gener and in particular in those area like rwanda where there is turmoil and conflict but precis what we ll do will be determin by the organ that ar address the question organ of which we ar now member mashokw mr presid but we see south african as be mercenari in angola have switch side from support unita nation union for the total independ of angola to support the govern of the dai there what is the govern s viewpoint on thi on mandela well i think that the posit in angola ha been complic by the fact that the south african govern ha been involv in try to perpetu thi conflict the approach of thi govern is total differ we want peac not onli in our countri but in our neighbor state and angola is part of our neighbor state king hassan of morocco houphouet boigni the late presid of cote d ivoir and myself were alreadi involv in address the problem in angola our concern is peac between the govern of the mpla popular movement for the liber of angola and unita and we ar commit to that and will resist ani develop that is go to interfer with that initi on our part and therefor the question of mercenari whether from south africa or from ani other countri is not consist with the attain of peac in angola and we will do everyth in our power to ensur that the need for mercenari is remov akhalwaya mr presid come back home when you were releas from prison on of the first meet that you gave for editor you talk about the process that wa start by robert mugab in zimbabw in go for a cabinet of uniti and also presid nujoma and you talk about a govern of nation uniti in thi countri that ha now come to fruition but at the same time the govern of nation uniti that you now have is more a compromis becaus especi for the cabinet minist that come from other parti you had no hand in and becaus of the bargain not all the peopl from your own parti would have been the best peopl of your choic is thi someth that you had plan is thi govern of nation uniti what you want all along mandela we would have been veri happi if thi govern repres onli the african nation congress but we ar solv problem in south africa not in the earth we have to take into account the actual condit in our countri we have through the multiparti forum brought togeth the variou organ in thi countri with total differ background as you know at on time we had no less then 26 polit parti in thi countri we have been abl to bring them on board and to achiev thi breakthrough which we celebr on the 10th on mai that alon show that we have everyth to gain by have involv all polit parti in thi process as against 26 polit parti we onli have three polit parti in the govern of nation uniti and that is why consensu is compar easi to reach and we now have had two cabinet meet and from all of them we have emerg with a unit approach and from the point of view of the condit in our countri thi is the correct strategi for anybodi who ha embark veri serious in reconcili and nation build mashokw mr presid do you word indistinct in your speech earlier todai that vulner worker will be safeguard by the govern doe thi mean that the immigr polici will deal differ with skill worker from outsid south africa mandela we ar interest that there should be no emigr of skill from the surround countri just as it is tragic for south africa to lose it citizen who have the knowledg the skill the expertis the train it is also tragic for our neighbor to lose peopl of skill at the present moment we have a higher rate of pai and peopl who ar skill from our neighbor territori especi now that we have a democrat govern the temptat is go to be to come to our countri and whilst we mai welcom them but that would creat seriou econom problem for our neighbor state and we ar entrust in stabil in thi entir region and therefor the problem which will creat econom difficulti for our neighbor state ar our concern akhalwaya mr presid how doe that tie in with your emphasi on individu right sure individu from other countri will feel that thi is where thei can do the best for themselv can thei be prevent from come here mandela well you must understand that our bill of right is intend for south african mainli it doe not mean that it should be appli mechan peopl come from other countri we ar entitl to decid the question of immigr on the basi of problem which an influx of skill peopl from other countri will creat in those countri you must realiz how much the neighbor state ar go to reli on south africa not becaus we ar go to throw our weight around becaus we have got a develop economi but becaus our economi can actual benefit the neighbor state on of the issu we have been make in our appeal to the intern commun is that to assist in the econom develop of south africa is actual to assist peopl of thi region becaus of the import role we ar like to plai if the intern commun help our economi to grow mashokw mr presid on
