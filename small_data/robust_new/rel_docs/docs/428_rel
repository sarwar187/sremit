consid onli as a potenti base for movement of variou orient but not as an elector base of exist parti and their leader russian polit mood were boost over two year by a struggl between the presid s support and the disband deputi corp judg by materi of all russia popul survei an advent of a strong hand author would rather pleas most citizen instead of caus concern among them while in april 1992 38 percent of survei russian express concern regard the lack of author in the countri seven month later in decemb of the same year it wa 42 percent and in april 1993 48 percent peopl understand that as long as author is impot it is hardli possibl to count on stabil of product strengthen of law and order and resolut of other problem in thi situat the idea of strengthen the state author through establish of a presidenti form of rule by constitut method alwai had a real chanc for all popular support us forc as a method of resolv the problem of redistribut of power between the execut and repres branch on the other hand never ha been attract to most peopl it is not accident that a survei of the russian populac conduct in novemb show that 58 percent of the respond saw the storm of the white hous as a nation shame in which both branch ar at fault it is not our power the popul s confid in the renew author in russia which had emerg on the basi of democrat of the societi got lost as time went by thi ha been caus both by exacerb of the gener crisi in the countri and by miscalcul of state bodi and the polici thei conduct for instanc on of the commonli accept indic of polit alien is how peopl see the extent of correl between the decis taken by the bodi of state administr and interest of the peopl as numer sociolog survei show more than 80 percent of the popul do not have a clear idea of the substanc of the polici conduct by the state and ar convinc that the state doe not care in ani wai about ordinari peopl and cater to their interest no less seriou evid of deepen polit alien is the increas polit apathi of the popul the loss of interest in polit action of all nation signific as is known 35 5 percent of russian citizen refus to particip in the referendum on 25 april 1993 a survei conduct after the referendum show that the subsequ sharp confront between feder bodi of execut and repres author caus a neg reaction among the populac most peopl were disappoint that the bodi of author us the result of the referendum to settl the score among themselv sociolog survei show that in the opinion of russian citizen the damag to the prestig of author wa inflict by the follow factor the gap between promis and actual deed especi the fact that the promis to implement a radic econom reform without a catastroph declin in the standard of live ha not been kept chao in lawmak as a result of which the overwhelm major of peopl ar not awar of legal refer point legal nihil on the part of the popul is increas a confront between the repres and execut feder and local institut of author bureaucrat of the apparatu of the bodi of state power and constant reshap of power structur corrupt among state functionari of special interest is the popul s attitud toward the govern of russia as had been the case with the govern of the former ussr it tradition remain outsid the field of attent of public opinion for instanc onli 10 15 percent of survei respond express posit and 15 20 percent neg opinion of the work of govern head by ryzhkov pavlov or gaydar most russian between 40 and 60 percent did not have ani firm opinion of thi institut of state power at all similarli most expert poll point out the vagu of the govern s action it tendenc to cater to polit trend a seriou argument indic defici on the part of the govern from the standpoint of public opinion also is that the popul survei increasingli often express concern over the lack of author in the countri explain it not so much by polit struggl as by atrophi of the system of state administr despit a more proactiv posit of the govern head by v chernomyrdin it also remain until late on the peripheri of public opinion for instanc accord to the data of an all russia opinion poll conduct in april 1993 41 percent of respond could not defin their attitud to thi govern it abil to deal with socioeconom problem of the countri among the reason that mani peopl ar ambigu in their attitud toward the govern is that within the system of power relat it tradition appear as a conduit of state polici rather than it activ princip the princip in polit and the master of the govern had been the politburo of the cpsu central

first paragraph is boldfac federatsiya introduct text famili nucleu of societi is a customari combin famili is the foundat or base of ani govern but who in our time is think about thi veri foundat decid for yourself what inde is there to sai about the famili nevertheless it is todai celebr a singular anniversari it is a year sinc the creation of the intern fund for the protect of motherhood and childhood and it presid the renown scientist and physician a baranov ha himself suggest talk with us about the current matern and child health statu in russia becaus it is imposs to keep silent ani longer baranov evid a few statist for a begin in russia there ha been a catastroph decreas in the birth rate thi year the figur will amount to approxim 25 percent thi is an unpreced for us such wa not the case dure the war some ar try to prove that thi is not realli so bad in europ for exampl the birth rate ha been tradition low in recent year denmark on whose level we ar now is cite as an exampl these ar fals figur the point is that when compar with the dane we have a 40 fold higher matern mortal rate and a 5 fold higher child mortal rate ar such incorrect comparison we and thei possibl from the standpoint of perspect it is better here to take germani israel and america which have until recent stimul immigr thei understand that the worker will make their govern prosper and strengthen it power thei give shelter citizen from variou countri of the world and we unfortun cannot take care of our own children and women recent a new and danger trend ha made itself known the child mortal curv ha move upward sinc june 1991 i will mention that befor then it had decreas steadili for 3 year the matern hospit in moscow and ye throughout all of russia todai stand empti or half empti i think the reason ar clear and common for all of societi the meager of financ the lack of the most elementari drug the low salari of medic personnel etc and inde befor the collaps of the union a program wa undertaken to construct modern matern hospit throughout the entir countri now when will there be time for them vasilyev excus me but why build if thei ar now stand empti baranov the troubl is that in our countri health care ha alwai seem to be in the background of societi the thing we just never built kamaz i e automobil produc by the kamsk automot plant canal dam the program we just never thought of the medicin we just never paid attent to mayb it s a commonplac situat specif the overwhelm number of our matern hospit ar in old impract build or build that ar simpli fall to piec that is why we must build vasilyev we have spoken with you about the birth rate but what about matern health baranov here as you understand the situat is hardli ani better four million abort ar perform in our countri each year as oppos to 1 700 000 birth there is no larger number of abort anywher in the world henc the matern mortal and variou femal diseas and the overal health of the nation our fund ha chosen the task of famili plan as it main direct the question is whether to do someth that should be a govern task under the power of some fund of cours not our goal ar more modest we want to help the govern in thi matter the point is that the fund ha unit in it rank renown specialist and scientist in the field of protect matern and child health we alreadi have depart open in georgia kyrgyzstan azerbaijan the crimea nizhnii novgorod ivanovo khabarovsk irkutsk and stavropol there is even a depart in washington and on is now be regist in belgium our intent is to make us of all of the advantag provid by thi form of public organ name speed flexibl and inform in solv on problem or anoth what specif have we set as our task to begin a famili plan campaign and abov all to fight to reduc the number of abort correct famili plan can reduc matern mortal by 40 percent and can cut the infant mortal rate in half and here abov all the need for contracept must be met we us to bui them but it is imposs to live on purchas we must creat our own industri we have found a dutch firm call organon that is examin our propos to sell coil and marvenol contracept tablet in russia the firm produc the world s best product of it type in gener we feel that if some product process is creat in russia it should be gear toward the highest qualiti product estim show that it realli possibl to begin manufactur coil and contracept by the end of 1993 we ar plan to increas annual product to 7 million unit plu 80 million packag of marvenol thi will fulli meet russia s need of cours the fund cannot sustain such a gigant program itself govern help is need we have approach parliament with our propos it appar support our propos and is now think of a wai to provid more specif assist vasilyev product as far as i can see is onli part of the problem and what about the rest increas the overal let us sai medic level of servic to mother and the necessari consult baranov you ar right the problem cannot be solv by the manufactur of contracept alon we ar also plan to creat a network of women s medic center in russia there thei will see first and foremost women from what is call the high risk group thei will be given the necessari examin and consult such a center ha alreadi been creat in moscow base on the former matern hospit imeni guberman the build lai empti for an entir year ow to pretens of a sanitari epidemiolog station we ask moscow s mayoralti to releas it to the fund and thei met us halfwai repair ar now under wai there we ar hope that the center will begin oper soon it will be equip with the most modern equip in a year we ar plan to have as mani as 50 000 women seen in it there is also an agreement with nizhnii novgorod to creat an analog center you understand the fund is act as a kind of catalyst we know all the bottleneck of our health care and without wait for the govern to get move ar try to elimin them we have more than a few helper abroad we ar veri hope that when peopl learn more about our idea and plan in our nativ fatherland thei will come to our aid vasilyev aleksandr aleksandrovich don t you have the feel that all attempt to save medicin ar doom it can collaps togeth with the entir economi unfortun all your good begin will not come to pass baranov i am an optimist by natur if i adopt your philosophi of doom i will have to fold my arm and wait for the end to come but life goe on and sooner or later the economi and medicin along with it will move uphil anywai our task is to help these process and how can on live without a futur i would like to continu we have implement two more program on is relat to vaccin and the other involv babi food with respect to vaccin we have begun work with the american firm lederl which is on of the world s two biggest firm in thi area it current produc akd expans not given vaccin which is be us successfulli against pertussi diptheria and measl we found a place far from moscow in obolensk where facil mai be establish to produc thi vaccin a studi of the project is now under wai i will add that it is on of todai s best and we ar maintain our approach here i think that on of the most complic situat in russia todai is that of babi food our next program is relat to just thi problem previous the ussr had five larg factori produc babi food that met 60 percent of the countri s need now after everyon ha scatter to hi own corner onli two factori remain in russia thei meet onli 40 percent of russia s demand the problem is most critic we have reach an agreement with the leader in the stavropol krai to construct a plant there we have long been conduct talk with foreign firm on thi score there ar two concret partner unfortun thei have still not made a final decis but we also have our own develop in thi area scientist from the nizhnii novgorod microbiolog and epidemiolog scientif research institut and pediatr scientif research institut have creat a uniqu product that is a substitut for babi food lactobacteriosi it tast is reminisc of foreign yogurt but it is much more valuabl from the standpoint of it qualiti it mai also be us successfulli by worker in toxic industri in the chernobyl zone and in region of ecolog troubl a shop produc thi product is alreadi oper at the rossiya state farm sovkhoz near nizhnii novgorod we had want to set up product at small shop produc thi foodstuff we have now found manufactur shop base at a defens plant next year we ar plan to launch 10 such shop the process is simpl and the raw materi is avail eventu we want to increas facil to launch 50 shop a year the object is to cover the entir countri with such small shop produc babi food vasilyev these ar allur plan but excus my indel question thei ar all just plan is there anyth concret baranov the us govern ha alloc 1 5 million for creation of a neonat intens care center we ar organ it on the basi of the morozov hospit in moscow our partner in the unit state is norfolk children s hospit the build

person to suffer a nervou breakdown let us deal with some of the repres problem the first problem is the conspicu declin in the birth rate and the number of birth dure the past 20 year ha been reduc from 2 million to 1 2 million peopl if the present low birth rate of 1 5 should continu the popul composit hereaft will suddenli shift in the direct of the ag and moreov the popul will begin to decreas about 20 year from now in the year after next the popul of the labor forc will begin to decreas and 25 year later the popul of the ag over 65 year will constitut 25 percent of the countri when the number of work peopl decreas it is onli natur for on to suppos that econom growth will stop at the same time the social secur expenditur will progress increas becaus of the increas in the popul of the ag and if the transposit is made with the present tax system intact the tax burden of the worker 30 year henc will like be about 70 percent at that time the old peopl s welfar will probabl be cut drastic and along with it a heavi consum tax will probabl have been introduc in order to equal the tax burden it seem like that the era in which everyon both young and old must lower the standard of live is about to be realiz in the not too distant futur there is no wai to protect against thi except either to increas the number of foreign worker or as quickli as possibl to return the birth rate from the present 1 5 to close to 2 1 sweden ha succeed in rais the birth rate from 1 6 to as much as 2 14 through such child care polici as grant matern leav with pai until the child is a year and a half old child care allow reduc work hour until the child is eight year old etc under thi system in sweden where by have just on of the two parent remain at home to babysit for a total of about two year on person who in the futur will work for 45 year between the ag of 20 and 65 will emerg and therefor thi is truli an advantag calcul from the standpoint of econom statist japan is a nation with an extrem high save rate but for the futur the number of young peopl who must shoulder japan s economi ha begun to decreas moreov with the increas in the popul of old peopl consumpt will increas more than save and therefor the save rate will unmistak shift to a declin if the work popul should decreas and the save rate should declin japan s economi will definit enter a degen stage lament of trade surplu the next problem is the expand trade surplu thi mean that the good produc through hard work by the japanes cannot be fulli util domest and have becom surplu good when compar with the middl class of the unit state and the former west germani the standard of live of the japanes is woefulli unequ the worker of the metropolitan citi ride overcrowd streetcar and commut from farawai small home for long hour no decent resort area ar found in their surround if the trade surplu were to be spent domest the standard of live of the japanes would improv spectacularli the trade surplu for last year wa about 130 billion if an equival amount of good were market domest it would be possibl to complet two tohoku bullet express railwai line and in addit to build seven seto grand bridg annual and even all the home in citi with a popul of a million peopl could be renov into mansion if wise invest a number of commut bullet express railwai line and a network of freewai can be built on the peripheri of the great metropolitan citi and it would probabl be possibl for everyon to commut from the larg residenti district locat within the nearbi countrysid and the idea of have the sewer system in all part of japan complet and the water in the river and lake purifi can be realiz in order to do so forc polici must be resort to such as restrict the privat ownership right of land or priorit it util if the object is for public us rais the cost of the privat ownership of land by levi a land tax with a uniformli heavi tax rate or reform the agricultur and fisheri industri still by rais the land tax rate the taxabl amount is not suppos to be high becaus land price will declin expans of the intern burden the third problem is japan s intern posit the cold war structur ha dissolv and the world ha begun to move furious toward the format of a new order for the unit state the object of strengthen it anti soviet anticommunist militari organ ha disappear and in it place the focu of it polici is laid on strengthen it econom power in order to prepar it strength to manifest it leadership under the new order the ill of the us economi have appear to be the two big deficit in financ and trade the clinton administr ha resolv to reduc the financi deficit by a total of 500 billion in the next five year it intend to accomplish thi by increas taxat of busi and the high incom bracket and through the reduct of militari expenditur and subsidi the reduct of financi deficit will produc a deflationari effect on the economi trade expans and reduct of import ar necessari in order to allevi thi effect the us govern is try to reduc the trade deficit with a strong determin at that time the on to becom the greatest target is japan which to the unit state is the countri with the greatest trade deficit at the recent us japan summit meet miyazawa reject presid clinton s request of make the ratio of the intern account surplu to the gnp below 5 percent in four or five year henc but regard the import industri field of automobil and their compon space industri equip etc thei appar agre to decid on the open market of the numer target valu of each on thi mean that regard the import field the japanes govern must assum the oblig of achiev the import object that have been decid on the unit state ha forc unfair control even against japanes busi but appar the japanes govern could not allud to them among the major unfair control ar the demand for self impos control on export to the unit state foreign invest control in the unit state polici of priorit the purchas of domest good place of origin control of ani busi advanc into the unit state forc the domest product ratio etc with the except of oil produc countri japan ha an expans export surplu in nearli all countri thi is true even with the unit state the unit state is try to prevent the increas of japan s export to the unit state is suppress the activ of japanes busi in the unit state and regard the import industri good is try to ensur a part of japan s market share japan s best plan in counter these effort is to expand the invest of the infrastructur such as transport citi home etc through the reform of the land system or the withdraw of variou control and therebi reduc the trade surplu but in realiti the plan is not possibl if the trade surplu cannot be reduc on a larg scale a balanc must be achiev by increas capit export by thi mean japan s oversea activ can be stimul and as japan s posit in the world expand then it intern respons on a compar basi will be demand regard the world s desir order for the futur japan must establish it world strategi under a clear vision endeavor in that direct and it must assum the econom burden for the abov reason at time the burden might becom a polit or militari on regrett the format of thi sort of vision is not possibl in todai s japan alreadi despit japan s intern posit be extrem high it doe not possess a world strategi despit the end of the cold war the us militari forc ar necessari for japan thi is becaus north korea might possess nuclear capabl in thi situat japan is compel to yield to the demand of the us govern if the worst happen thi situat might remain the same all through even hereaft will the japanes govern chang under these circumst come to think of it japan inde ha been plai a truli foolish role we japanes have reduc the number of children in our famili work faithfulli and as a result the good we have produc cannot be util to the fullest and ar export abroad and the peopl abroad through high qualiti japanes good have been enjoi a conveni life the foreign exchang deriv from these good is invest abroad and it ha serv to expand employ and improv incom begin with the east asian countri in the variou foreign countri the standard of live of the japanes peopl is realli not outstandingli high and yet japan ha disburs the largest amount of fund as oversea assist compar with the rest of the world japan donat 11 billion dure the persian gulf war despit all thi the fact is that japan is not respect by the world it appear that there ar more countri critic of japan the japanes peopl ar exasper but fortun the world ha chang recent and even the polit of japan appear to be chang as for the mechan that check the develop of japan s economi and the improv of the standard of live lower the birth rate and gave birth to the huge trade surplu the expect although a mere trifl that it might crumbl ha emerg along with the end of the cold war the need to fear social disappear and along with these develop the basi for the exist of a dictatori govern in south korea or taiwan disappear and both countri have chang to democrat govern even in japan the reason for the ldp on parti rule disappear in the cold war order the ldp with on parti rule strengthen militari cooper between the unit state and japan while the social democrat parti of japan fulfil it function by curb further involv and render a sens of secur to the peopl a long

FBIS3-47040: languag japanes articl type cso discuss by shinyasu hoshino chairman of the nation institut for research advanc hiroko ota osaka univers associ professor naobumi ishiguro chairman of the board of director of the takugin research institut and koji oguni ekonomisuto editor in chief at symposium cosponsor by the takugin research institut and ekonomisuto in sapporo grand hotel sapporo citi on 8 septemb on the theme of japan s perspect toward the year 2010 text now is a turn point oguni first i would like to begin thi discuss by have ms ota and mr ishiguro give their impress as to mr hoshino s keynot speech ota i felt that after all we were at a turn point i would like to add two import point which we will have to experi by the year 2010 in the econom field first domest our product ha a larg dual structur the product of manufactur industri is veri high but that of agricultur bank servic and distribut is low and thi is push price upward as long as thi situat continu it will be difficult to build a beauti nation land as mention by mr hoshino in order to remov thi dual structur it is first necessari to eas regul thi will compel us to shift from our past emphasi on equal of outcom to emphasi on equal of opportun the cozi do busi side by side structur which ha thu far maintain japan s stabil will be subject to a weed out process amid the market principl the other point is a chang in the work mode in thi connect the cost reduct competit base on the convent formula of quick sale at small profit ha now reach it limit on the other hand there ar intensifi demand by worker for shorter work hour and an era of labor forc shortag will come becaus of the inevit need to rais per capita product the system of addit wage for overtim work and that of the lifelong employ will collaps ishiguro i agre almost entir with what mr hoshino said howev as to the ag societi issu he mention i think that a more seriou problem is rather the trend of declin birth i somewhat feel that the year 2010 will mark a turn point at which the popul begin to decreas those born around 1950 now make up the largest segment of popul thei will retir in huge number in about 17 or 18 year in addit women s childbear is expect to decreas at a veri rapid pace i think that the error in popul forecast by the ministri of health and welfar ar inde shame the ministri alwai overestim in it forecast the birthrat is 1 53 children at present but about three or four year ago the rate for thi year wa estim at 1 8 children anoth point is the central of administr power or the issu of on parti rule by the liber democrat parti ldp it appear that those issu now face a period of sweep adjust all want to work with larg enterpris and thing ar converg onli into tokyo all these cannot be blame on the central govern but we have chosen them on our own we want to put our children in privat tutori school send them to the univers of tokyo and have them work at central govern offic major bank or larg enterpris we sought such thing in the belief that thei would unmistak bring us happi and we have attain these thing howev we ar now begin to cast suspici ey on them oguni mr hoshino do you have ani opinion to give regard the comment made by these two hoshino concern the ag societi mr ishiguro said that the declin birth rate wa a veri import problem i too think that the declin in birth is a veri import subject nevertheless the process of women becom liber is a good thing is it not product of the male societi ha reach it limit in a sens by women s particip there mai aris a differ in product from now the declin birth rate will continu for some time but after the passag of such an era japan mai develop into a countri like sweden the question is how we should consid such a cours of develop perhap for about 20 year to come the declin birth rate will deepen and the ag of societi will further intensifi accordingli new industri to be nurtur in local oguni i think that it is a common recognit that we have now come to a great turn point with variou issu in such a situat you ar all sai that we mai find a solut or a direct for our futur cours in the decentr of administr power in thi context i would like to shift our discuss to why administr power should be decentr ishiguro the decentr of administr power is not a question of yesterdai what we now call the provision council for the promot of administr reform which function dure the ikeda cabinet with then mitsui bank now sakura bank presid kiichiro sato as it central figur also contend that it wa import to decentr administr power thirti year later there wa the second provision council for the promot of administr reform led by mr toshio doko dure the nakason cabinet mr doko succeed in bring the govern run ntt nippon telegraph and telephon corpor etc into the hand of the privat sector howev noth ha been attempt up to date in shift power from central to local quarter concentr everyth on tokyo as seen in the unipolar converg of thing into tokyo the central of administr power the on parti rule by the ldp and all huge enterpris huge bank and huge newspap compani have their main offic in tokyo ha been an extrem advantag polici for japan s growth and effici howev with the passag of some 40 year under thi polici all the peopl have begun to think twice about thi posit we now stand at the crossroad in thi regard there is an auto part manufactur compani name dynac in chitos that produc 60 percent of japan s automobil clutch disk in the old dai all auto part compani had differ affili like affili with toyota or nissan and thei were under the keiretsu system rule by major firm in all aspect such as personnel affair capit relationship and distribut howev nowadai nissan or toyota would be unabl to exist if it follow thi practic such a brilliant industri firm exist in hokkaido as well and the earn power of thi kind of enterpris ha now becom much greater when such an industri chang is effect the unipolar converg of thing into tokyo will also chang oguni the convent system ha becom ineffici and the mind of peopl now seek affluenc howev japan s potenti growth rate is no longer veri high ota to be sure the econom growth rate will becom lower for the long term on thing we do not know at present is what industri will becom japan s drive forc now what we need most at present is to nurtur futur excel compani i think that perhap the knowledg intens industri will becom japan s drive forc in the futur howev it is believ that a capac to gener new thing will not grow under the present tokyo circumst where peopl suffer from accumul stress caus by their endur of harsh commut condit i think that capac will probabl grow in circumst where there is cultur broad space and greeneri and where it is possibl to activ human brain to a greater extent at ani rate it will be necessari to eas regul and thoroughli reduc control so that newer thing can be gener and that local can nurtur new industri and improv live circumst by mean of their own independ strategi and under these condit thei also need to discuss a feder system in earnest there is no countri with as much econom power as our that is enforc the central of administr power in addit i would like to mention three point which i am now consid with regard to the decentr of administr power first i think that the work of decentr administr power in hokkaido should begin with the posit that hokkaido no longer need the hokkaido develop agenc when peopl discuss decentr of administr power their argument should also includ how to resolv the issu of revenu sourc thei cannot bring up onli favor aspect in their debat second the more decentr deepen the more that local strategi ar need how should hokkaido be dealt with the strategi relat to thi question is most call for is it not third the need for strategi for all of japan is also be call for along with the decentr of administr power when the econom growth rate fall public work ar scatter in local area to remov the incom gap debat is necessari on the order of prioriti to be given to these local abolish construct and transport ministri oguni to carri our discuss a step forward let us move to the question of which work we have to touch first strateg mr hoshino suspect that the question of land util would emerg as a point of discuss what argument ar now be made in kasumigaseki govern offic quarter in tokyo hoshino the central of administr power prove to be a quicker mean for repair war damag and improv river in the postwar period on the basi of uniform standard it wa a kind of plan economi howev the peopl have becom fed up with thi so respect local public bodi have begun shape variou design in thi regard i know onli partial instanc but as for the wai the current subsidi administr is work it is collect good exampl from local area and to have those exampl follow across the nation it is ask for instanc kyushu to begin the same project that were sucessfulli carri out in hokkaido if so it would be better that local area themselv assum the whole work directli there is no need at all to go through the filter of kasumigaseki the abil of local planner ha increas markedli of late thi is an ag in which the peopl directli make thing thei want most at nearbi place is it not i think that thi is the real form of decentr administr power howev it should be the last phase to entrust revenu sourc to local area entrust the us of land should preced it thi is becaus subsidi ar gener append to the util of land when decis maker on land us ar revers those who assum the subsidi administr ar also revers subsequ touch the issu of the tax alloc to local govern is the next step otherwis small citi town and villag will instantli find themselv in an impass ishiguro i think that the land issu mr hoshino mention repres a big proposit in a sens it seem that the issu of decentr administr power will not be resolv smoothli unless we chang our posit drastic if we mean busi we had better abolish the construct and transport ministri and transfer all of their author to local there will be no wai of give such author to the central govern again becaus it no longer ha those organ what the central govern requir by all mean ar the foreign ministri the defens agenc the econom plan agenc at present peopl think that tax earn in tokyo ar distribut to local but will thi be true local resid should be arm theoret for exampl the kojimachi tax offic which take in the largest amount of nation tax collect over 2 trillion yen tokyo alon collect 35 percent of total nation tax should these tax earn belong onli to tokyo no thei should not payment ar made there simpli becaus main compani offic ar locat there these earn should be divid correctli the mayor of izumo citi in shiman prefectur tetsundo iwakuni sai old folk send their children to colleg in tokyo and remit 1 5 million yen for their live expens everi year the children do not return to shiman and work in tokyo for 30 year the old folk remain in shiman and their burden fall on shiman prefectur as hi remark suggest it is no wonder that the lion s share is taken by tokyo while local ar place in the red by accommod onli those old folk left behind i hope that such loss will be compens accur i sai thi becaus it is local that brought up the children accord to a comput local suffer loss amount to 12 trillion yen each year thei need to have these loss compens as for hokkaido it doe not need to obtain compens becaus it loss and gain ar about the same howev some sai that hokkaido is not earn enough tax incom to take up it share of the tax burden which the whole of japan must bear thi mai be true no correct estim ar avail in thi respect but i think that we still have to make consider effort in thi regard moreov i would like to take an issu with govern offic stanc that there can be no mistak onc thei begin a thing even if thei find it wrong halfwai thei take dozen of year to rectifi it thi erron stanc seem to be traceabl to a notion that govern offic ar not allow to make a mistak furthermor the price of govern procur commod ar too high for exampl compar with franc the per kilomet cost of the shinkansen bullet train line is 10 time that of the french tgv line the cost of japan s public road is three time as high as for build like hotel the per tsubo 3 954 squar yard cost stand around 1 million yen in tokyo as against 300 000 yen in new york thi is partli ascrib to control when it come to the question of control we ar apt to instantli refer onli to agricultur product and rice but in fact mani japanes commod ar subject to control oguni peopl seem to share the view that all thi should be chang drastic howev the problem li after thi common percept what come next is the question of who on earth can make the chang in what form ota i think that as drastic measur there ar the adopt of a feder system and the transfer of the capit citi for the time be howev it is after all necessari to thoroughli eas regul as a midterm program i strongli hope that voic will be rais from local area in thi regard for exampl i wonder why local have not voic their support for the land valu tax rais the land valu tax mean rais the cost of undertak in place such as tokyo where land price ar high when the land valu tax goe up extra undertak will spread to local as thei cannot be carri out in tokyo anoth point is that it is import whether cooper is possibl among autonom bodi it is import whether thei can formul later orient program let us take up the traffic system for instanc variou inconveni ar caus becaus the transport and construct ministri act separ cooper between road and railwai is not smooth vertic orient program repres idea of the suppli side while later orient program ar idea of the demand side it is simpl to abolish the nation ministri and agenc but as a precondit for decentr administr power it is desir that certain region contain sever citi or prefectur will work out their own program if such move aris spontan from local i think that the groundwork for the decentr of administr power will be get solid turn sapporo into citi for intern convent oguni well last i would like to hear your idea as to what should be done for the benefit of hokkaido hoshino regard hokkaido i think that it would be good if the vicin of sapporo were turn into a citi for intern convent that is a citi like geneva on the other hand obihiro is a agricultur zone it is desir to have a beauti area where an intern citi and an agricultur zone coexist at present singapor is a citi for intern convent in asia there is no other citi that is fit for hold intern confer as is seen in the visit to niseko and tomamu both area in hokkaido by rich peopl in southeast asia for pleasur which is develop now becaus of it climat and natur featur hokkaido will be consid veri exot and interest for peopl in asia in addit visitor from around the world will not onli attend intern meet befor thei leav thei will unfailingli see the sight of nearbi citi i think that the sceneri of the rural area around obihiro will strike those southeast asian visitor with wonder in thi sens as well it would be better to further deepen the conscious that hokkaido is our northernmost zone it is situat around 40 degre north latitud it will turn into a crossroad where guest come from the south in endless success it will thu becom a citi for intern convent thi is the dream i have ota it is not natur featur and rich human alon that form local attract if it is so call local attract ar noth but slight variat of thing in larg citi i think that hokkaido must have it own uniqu attract attract that exist onli in it local if peopl in hokkaido find and know hokkaido s attract i believ that hokkaido ha plenti of room for further develop on attract i feel to hokkaido is it fond for new the peopl there ar free of odd prejudic and thei ar liber thei ar magnanim and broad mind in their recept to heterogen howev i hear that the process of stiffen and fixat ha gradual begun in hokkaido as well i hope hokkaido will remain a place that alwai give birth to new thing i strongli hope that excel futur compani will be nurtur in hokkaido ishiguro we have heard two panelist express their affect for hokkaido present hokkaido resid were poll about what town thei would like to live in sapporo rank first over 90 percent of the respond said that thei would like to live in sapporo rank last wa shinjuku ku with about 4 percent name it the reason why tokyo is not good ar first it ha no natur surround second it is hard to own a hous in the citi and third tokyo lack flexibl in term of time as well as mental nevertheless half the respond said that thei like tokyo why it is becaus the citi is full of fun it is fun to work there and also relax there it is an enjoy place intellectu as well hokkaido is mildli enjoy as a place to work and enjoi oneself as to recreat in particular on can enjoi golf and ski instantli the largest problem is the lack of intellectu fun thi is import i want hokkaido univers to work hard to thi end mr hoshino talk about make an intern citi and in thi regard hokkaido resid should think more about the signific of chitos airport the new kansai airport is total hopeless it cost too much and doe not have domest flight it cost 10 time more than chitos airport yet the transport ministri will take side with the new kansai airport unless we keep a sharp watch on the ministri s move thi is becaus it offici ar station there we must maintain our sharp watch with a determin not to toler unfair last i would like to touch on the issu of move the capit mani place includ tochigi sendai osaka and kyoto ar now make activ to induc the author to set up the new capit in their area but i think that when the capit is transfer to a new area the area should be independ from the prefectur it ha belong to it should becom someth like washington dc the area should be consid a common district for 47 citi and prefectur and separ from it former prefectur otherwis anoth tokyo will be creat again

mani who take the view that it is better to be a slave in on s own countri than a sultan among foreign have return onc and for all in spite of our grave econom condit what kind of a contribut will such individu make to the growth of our peopl s number tatimov inde it is true that a great caravan of migrat ha begun to flow into our countri our kinsmen were forc to leav their countri far behind throw their fate to the wind thei encount oppress from conserv at the time of the civil war were annihil by leftist persecut at the time of goloshchekin and were alarm by racist oppress dure the era of coloni for a time we blacken the reput of these innoc but now a just polit evalu is be assign and we ar not be spare in our help to all of those express a desir to return to their nativ land in spite of the fact that our sovereign countri is itself bare on it feet thi process is go forward with the direct support of the govern and the presid i am on of those directli respons for begin what is in truth the last great migrat for it proper manag and for it timeli the ministri of labor of foreign affair and of intern affair ar involv with such problem as the settlement of our kinsmen return from abroad on in three of our kinsmen in mongolia that is to sai more than 50 000 have return we mai sai that the caravan ha start and ha taken the road thi great caravan will be continu from still other countri kazakh live in tajikistan becam refuge last year due to the effect of the civil war start by religi extremist our presid ha given them great assist food cloth and drug have been deliv by special train some 6 000 of the 9 000 kazakh in tajikistan have been evacu simultan on the train some 1 200 famili have been resettl in southern kazakhstan oblast primarili in zhetisai rayon at the time of the 1990 osh incid i wa in qorghantob oblast in qolkhozabat rayon at that time i advis our kinsmen in that area to return quickli to their countri most listen to what i had to sai but some seem to want to continu to think about it resourc were adequ to evacu them those remain behind who did not migrat regret it and in the end had to be remov involuntarili at the time of the civil war thu there were also loss in gener it is a good thing to listen to expert think about what to do in such question new focus for migrat have emerg by the end of the year a total of 7 000 person 1 000 famili from iran and 400 famili from turkei will migrat a new migrat depart is now carri out preparatori work the head of thi depart ghaziz yesmuqanov pamir kameldiyev and nurlan ralqymzhanov ar do a great deal of work first of all thei ar plan to evacu militari refuge who desert at the time of the war in afghanistan thi is becaus thei ar citizen of no countri lack employ suffer from poor live standard and for that reason should be return to kazakhstan quickli the proverb state it is difficult to begin a trek if we understand how to be human by creat favor condit for those come for the first time and for those now leav i think that the 15 000 kazakh still remain in iran and the 25 000 in turkei will want to return to their homeland our butter heal from iran will primarili find a place to live in warm southern kazakhstan oblast the reason is that we cannot send those come from warm climat to place where the weather is sever thei might not becom acclimat there there is someth which must be said here we ar predispos not to like but to hate kazakh instead of take our countrymen who have come from foreign countri into our midst and make them our kinsmen we accus them by sai oh ar we to take thi to mean that you have not forgotten kazakh custom you sai on thing and do anoth we call those return from mongolia mongol and those come from turkei turk those come from europ we accus for their inabl to speak kazakh at all there ar now those who assign guilt becaus we accept some peopl who do no work at all instead of act like thi and look for problem i can sai that if abov all we make it possibl for them to support themselv and help them to get us to the new countri everyth will be fine i do not know whether or not you understand my dear when i call our foreign countrymen butter heal i have my reason for call them thi what have your kazakh not experienc dure the time of the lake alqa flight dzungarian invas thei put on foot behind the other in the snow and becam white heal dure the era of coloni thei suffer oppress as yellow heal dure the time of the civil war thei wander as black heal dure the time of goloshchekin thei suffer slaughter as red heal there is the wise teach of our forefath that there is a good side to everi difficulti in fact there must be good side to each of these four difficulti the first good side i think is that our kinsmen who have gone to foreign countri have return as butter heal thei will make a contribut to the flourish of our nation with their work good honor intent and experi in the school of life it is well known that butter heal immigr ar those who have made countri such as america australia argentina new zealand and canada flourish and develop similarli three million of the butter heal resid in foreign countri will make a major contribut to the flourish and enrich of our sovereign nation for that reason we must put our white tablecloth on the tabl befor them and we must assembl them togeth in our black yurt call kazakhstan we have mention the migrat which we have recent organ we have observ other disorgan element migrat there ar also mani who have return to their nativ countri with their own resourc or by forc thu 20 000 peopl came last year from russia 14 000 from uzbekistan and 6 000 from other republ 40 000 in all all of these migrant will have a favor influenc on the exhaust ethno demograph shape of our republ someth els which i would like to mention i think that god will and if the world doe not end a new campaign will begin in the new futur to move gradual local peopl remain behind in the ecolog disast of the aral to northern oblast and rayon which ar ecolog healthi but ar still weak in their ethno demograph structur thi would compris first and foremost aral qazali and shalqar rayon which remain in the disast area later if possibl we will have to take up the question of return our kinsmen live in karakalpakistan to the motherland that migrat would occupi a particular place in the ethno demograph develop of kazakhstan accord to my calcul if we were to move at least half of the 600 000 of our karakalpak kinsmen live in the vicin of the aral in an organ manner to the recent master region that alon would chang the ethno demograph shape of northern kazakhstan in our favor in a fundament wai qurmanqulqyzi children were onc mani in the famili of kazakh who knew how to repeat the proverb a hous with children is a bazaar a hous without children a dry graveyard it ha been said that the number of larg famili ha been on the declin in recent year what kind of evid can you offer in regard to thi tatimov thi question is on which is dear to my heart and well known to me sinc i understand the question well i have been endeavor to instil demograph thought and tradit attitud into the mind of kazakh women fact from my own research ar offer in my book tale of the peopl or number and thought and in my recent publish eighth book kazakh world how mani kazakh ar there when and where have kazakh been driven out when and where have thei been oppress shot these two book must still have not reach reader the first copi of the first book were put into the pocket of those attend the world confer of kazakh the book is still not on sale and mai never be on sale the second book ha onli recent been publish with a run of 60 000 from the ata mura press head by an intellectu call muqtar qulmukhametuli for that reason let me repeat these fact again for kazakh women from what is in thi book accord to the 1926 censu each marri kazakh women had on the averag 10 children after that the birth rate abat the reason for thi were the deterior of the health of the peopl hunger and russian settlement it could be said that the russian had a role russian women at that time too took good care of themselv and did not have larg famili wa not thi characterist of their begin to infect kazakh women in 1959 the number of birth per woman had fallen to seven howev sinc infant mortal decreas along with the birthrat a demograph wave a new explos appear the reason wa that wherea women had previous born 10 children while onli on or two or surviv now onli on or two of seven children di and five six live to matur thu a demograph explos wa creat thi wa a gener process take place worldwid kazakhstan made it own contribut the demograph wave last until the 1970s accord to 1989 censu inform the high birthrat of recent time had strongli declin and we were near a three child threshold therebi we approach a level of two children in the citi and of four children in rural area thi must give kazakh women a great deal to think about in particular the market place wa exert a neg influenc while the birthrat continu to declin the number of children given birth by kazakh mother in absolut term stai more or less the same the fact that thi year the number of children given birth to by kazakh women in the republ will be in the vicin of 202 000 205 000 is onli becaus the demograph structur of our peopl is young the reason is that those born dure the period of the demograph explos now have famili and ar bring children into the world i emphas in an interview given to the newspap zha alash the need to struggl for a fourth child the reason is that if the first child is a son it replac the father and if a girl the mother and the second child simpli replac the parent the third child compens for our variou defici those not marri and old maid therebi we maintain our number at a set level it is the fourth child which provid growth i myself am the tenth and last child of my father and the last child of my mother the fourth son but for such kazakh characterist of my parent i would not have come into the world in 1940 just befor the war dure the last difficulti of a time of persecut if that wa so who would be now talk to you here about demograph tatimov laugh loudli when he said thi qurmanqulqyzi on of the question which you have rais and which ha gain the attent of the nation dure the last two or three year is get on or two children from women who ar still young but have not found mate for thi purpos thei becom junior wive or second wive to men who alreadi have senior wive there ar mani who ar against thi have you now chang your support for thi polici tatimov no thi is a veri complic question it should not be oversimplifi in thi manner a kazakh ha said the most difficult struggl ar the struggl for land and the struggl of widow howev todai the struggl of those old ladi must be more difficult than ani it would not be too much to devot an entir interview just to that question let me first of all tell who these old ladi ar and provid an explan that is becaus some go on about old ladi old ladi but do not know who thei ar old ladi ar those of the femal sex who ar over 25 but not yet 50 who have never marri never establish a household and have had no children in develop countri an express like kazakh old ladi is altogeth absent kazakh women fear gossip and remain in their inappropri state todai thei cannot extric themselv from their dilemma my advic is as follow let us get a child or so from them all thi sever advic mai seem a littl coars to other but life prove that it is correct is not becom a mother and love a child better than live alon when we realiz that most of todai s old ladi ar offic worker we know that thei live in front of peopl for that reason thei fear malici word in my opinion it is crimin for them to wast their live becaus peopl gossip there ar at present 110 000 old ladi among the kazakh and if thei had onli on two children thi would bring a gener of 220 000 into the world just like the proverb a voraci hors is no good hors to be call an old ladi is no honor for a woman the word of the peopl ar on thing the law of life ar anoth there is no need to issu a special law on the take of two wive it would be proper if thi question were decid with the particip of the mosqu all we have to do is to drop articl 208 of the law on marriag and the famili it is state there that take two wive is forbidden accord to my research no on ha been brought to trial on the basi of that law sinc the war that is to sai thi law is entir ineffect thu we must drop a dead law which no longer function after that as the russian sai we can do anyth which is not forbidden i know that some peopl do not agre with my view on old ladi that is to be expect everyon will not agre with everi suggest that is made there will be propon and oppon of everi innov that is life i know well that when i first made thi suggest that there would be opposit and that my oppon would primarili be those women support a fals emancip who ar liter and who think themselv equal to their husband some time even superior moreov thei inde came out against me and we were unabl to cast light on thi vital question onli when thi ha been done can we cautious approach thi question as imparti possibl and in a seriou manner it would be proper for us to look at the issu in such a wai that no on is insult and no on s feel ar hurt those in favor of polygami in order to back up their posit make the point that kazakh formerli practic polygami and that thi ancestr custom must be renew i am a support of limit polygami but have no desir to present decept evid in support of my view as shown by the 1897 censu onli three four percent of the kazakh men of the time had two wive and those with three wive were on in a thousand thu if our women who have remain unmarri becom second wive to around four five percent of all kazakh men the problem would therebi gradual be solv qurmanqulqyzi it would seem as if anoth of the idea which you have advanc your thought on recogn mother of larg famili ha found express in the presidenti edict on thi topic thu you ar make plan for the carri out of your suggest relat to the presidenti edict when will the dai aris when the appropri mother get golden prize and silver prize in honor these mother will onli the number of children brought into the world be consid or will there be other measur as well tatimov inde i am make plan it will not be long until such prize ar award competit for these gold and silver prize honor ar be announc nomin ar be review but no select have been made the golden prize will be given to mother who have born and rais eight or more children in my view the level should be reduc to seven sinc the number of mother with larg famili is on the declin and the number seven is a lucki number for the kazakh the word suffici zhettik and adequaci zhetistik have come from the word for seven zheti and the idea of offer seven of someth of prepar seven cake have arisen from that superstit the silver prize will be given to distinguish mother who have rais five or more children howev i have express the view that mother with three children or more should also be includ among the rank of those with larg famili likewis i have offer the suggest that if there ar distinguish mother who rais and educ still more children the presid himself or the premier or the governor of the appropri oblast or rayon should award them a special prize to be sure mother who have born mani children but who have not educ them properli or even abandon them will not receiv such honor far from it qurmanqulqyzi mr tatimov pleas do not hold it against me if i seem disrespect and ask a question that is too direct you to be sure ar on of those interest in the growth of you countri and in thi regard have come out against artifici abort howev who know better than women the soul and circumst of women for exampl if a husband s incom is inadequ to rais and educ five six children who gain from the bear of children who crowd togeth for a miser hand to mouth exist in addit an era of total destitut such as the present and the ecolog environ ar have a consider neg impact upon the health of mother everi other pregnant women is anem it is well known that women with thi diseas do not bear healthi children thu it would seem appropri that the decis in thi area to have children or limit a famili belong to the famili and to women themselv tatimov inde i am oppos to abort you ar correct the decis to limit or not limit the number of children is someth which concern husband and wife equal first the woman and then the man mani women do not take into consider their husband s view on thi question thi is the reason for the increas in the number of abort and the us of the loop the man must also particip in determin famili size i think that it would be appropri in the futur to introduc a law that marri women must have their husband s permiss to get an abort or to have a loop instal in particular smart women too often think of their own concern and ar have a neg influenc on our demograph to give number wherea 204 000 kazakh were born in kazakhstan in 1992 dure the same year 100 000 abort were perform in the republ 50 000 loop were instal and variou other thing were done to prevent the birth of children as a result more than half of the children brought to life by kazakh women some 250 000 were elimin the number of children who could have been born but were not born exceed the number of children born we ar not sai that famili should not be limit each mother should be concern about her health howev the fact that 300 000 children of kazakh women capabl of bear children were voluntarili suffoc and reject make my insid seeth is that islam thi leav asid humanitarian consider last year 47 000 kazakh di some 300 000 children were born and even with the death of 55 000 our peopl could have gain not 157 000 but 245 000 we we ourselv thu extinguish a substanti 88 000 of our natur increas there ar the lament black old woman black old man black child leav their sorrow alon who is express sorrow for the child never born and who feel the loss there is no artist to produc a song about thi or to write word the greatest of sorrow is the sorrow of the unborn child i miss them although i am onli a demograph my word to my daughter in law were when she had had a child and wa in difficulti becaus of it my kazakh it is said each child ha it own fate there is a kazakh folk sai if on extra lamb is born there will be on more plot of grass i am against limit famili with the excus that as the market place ha gain so much power we cannot support them let me consid each child separ the first child is alwai born for the father and replac him the second child is born to replac the mother the third child is born to compens for defici the fourth child is necessari for demograph law for growth if the fifth child come to life it doe so for the peopl the sixth child is for the fatherland for the flourish of our sovereign countri the seventh child that is an honor number and word which fulfil the desir of heaven when the eighth child is born the spirit ar satisfi when the ninth child is born it satisfi the muslim religion the will of allah if you sai that we ar nine children in our home then your mother and father aqqaysha and qurmanqul ar person who have satisfi the will of heaven in the blue sky of the spirit of the dark earth and of allah the onli god i would like to sai thank and express my satisfact to your mother in particular and thereaft to your father for increas and make flourish the number of the kazakh as for anemia thi diseas is due to dietari and vitamin defici for that reason slaughter a sheep and give it to a woman who ha just given birth just as on doe befor she give birth as a qalzha special food for pregnant women it would be appropri if the place where she work or if she doe not work the place her husband work or the kolkhoz or sovkhoz where the famili live were to provid it i think thi is someth for local governor to think about qurmanqulqyzi let us return to the question of old ladi discuss abov there ar mani unmarri men in my view it would seem proper for thi issu to find it own proper solut without some special state polici what new fact and suggest do you have to offer about thi tatimov some have complain that i talk a lot about the problem of old ladi there ar lot of old bachelor why not pick on them the reason is that women ar the fundament demograph support it is thei who increas or decreas the number of peopl for demographi if a man remain unmarri with no shame at the word of great if he is impot thi mean noth sinc anoth man will take hi place howev if a woman doe not marri or remain steril or di anoth woman cannot replac her the posit of everi woman is special in demograph if a man di thi is just on minu for demographi howev when a woman leav the world we must produc sever minus if the woman is young thi mean that four children 12 grandchildren at three each from the children 24 great grandchildren from the grandchildren at two each will not be born for thi reason in demographi the problem of 110 000 old ladi is more of a problem than 44 000 old bachelor the reason for the increas in the number of old bachelor is the worsen of ecolog condit in the republ some of the children be born in the environment disast area suffer from impot when we spoke of old bachelor we refer to male who have never marri between the ag of 30 and 55 recent i collect statist throughout the republ on those assault and kill on anoth look at thi inform it wa primarili men who assault and kill on anoth their number were three time more than the women i wonder if the increas in the number of peopl kill each other wa due to impot thi is onli a hypothesi we must look at the question more deepli among women there ar also uninterest women frigid women that is women who ar not interest in men howev thei do not kill each other for that reason howev impot is a great grief for men i have state abov that old ladi cannot get out of their difficulti on their own but i repeat that in addit to the state the mosqu should becom involv in thi question howev our mosqu still take a mistaken view of them i call thi their social impot qurmanqulqyzi mr tatimov ar there question which concern you more than other just now as a person who love hi countri tatimov tomorrow i will leav on a trip to koshetaw my purpos in go there is to carri out preparatori work for transfer there the migrat depart establish under the ministri of labor the reason as i have alreadi state is that the northern oblast ar still weak demograph for that reason we have decid to move thi depart to kokshetaw with the aim of prevent such manifest as separat harm our young nation as we chang the ethno

resid ha declin therefor befor we draw similar conclus it would make sens to analyz the caus and mean of these chang furthermor there is the danger of overestim secondari phenomena of attach special import to them while overlook the primari on it is import to lai bare the natur of the recent demograph chang which of them will determin our demograph prospect and how well do thei conform with our demograph vision is it veri import that the popul keep grow perhap it is more import to know why it grow and what sort of demograph futur will be brought about by the chang that ar take place prior to the end of the last decad lithuania wa character by a constant and by the standard of other european countri fairli larg growth in popul howev almost half of thi growth consist of migrat from the republ of the late soviet union primarili from russia the annual net immigr us to amount to 7 8000 peopl that wa hardli caus for rejoic we would have been happier with a lower level of popul growth with the chang in the polit situat popul growth began to slow in 1989 and to declin by 1992 with the restor of independ the pattern of migrat underw fundament chang greatli increas emigr consider exceed the declin rate of immigr and the net balanc becam neg some without bother to analyz who is go where draw the conclus that mani of us ar leav our homeland howev statist data show that the emigr consist primarili of russian belarusian and ukranian in 1992 the net balanc of migrat to the ex republ of the soviet union wa minu 21 100 peopl and in 1993 minu 12 000 we can take pleasur in the fact that repatri is take place peacefulli and uncoerc even a signific declin in popul due to thi reason is hardli caus for concern back to the subject thu far emigr to the countri of the west ha not been great in 1989 1993 the lithuanian popul declin by 5 600 due to migrat to the west thi constitut onli 12 percent of the total declin in the number of inhabit due to migrat jew constitut the primari migrant to western countri dure the last five year the lithuanian popul wa reduc by 900 due to migrat to the west howev it must be emphas that the offici statist ar incap at thi time of complet pin down the total emigr to the west it seem that we will have to determin later how mani did not return from short trip abroad anywai due to emigr to both east and west dure the last five year the popul of lithuania wa reduc by 51 800 peopl as a result from 1989 to 1993 the number of russian in lithuania declin by 33 600 that of ukranian by 7 400 that of the belarusian by 7 000 and that of the jew by 5 300 at the same time 5 400 more lithuanian immigr than emigr with the return home of the lithuanian who had for variou reason been scatter across the late soviet union their number ar grow the percentag of lithuanian in the gener popul is also grow thei constitut 79 6 percent in 1989 and 81 1 percent in 1994 sinc the number of inhabit and it growth ar not end in themselv the current observ declin in popul due to emigr cannot be view as a seriou demograph problem it especi should not be permit to overshadow those demograph problem that demand special attent and resolut action while natur increas ha thu far remain posit dure the last few year and especi in 1993 as the death rate rapidli increas and the birth rate decreas it approach that fate boundari at which fewer ar born than die dure the last coupl of decad natur increas account for an annual increas of 20 000 in the popul in 1993 it wa onli 600 in 1993 almost 7 000 fewer children were born and 4 600 more peopl di than in 1992 the number of birth declin from 53 600 in 1992 to 46 700 in 1993 i e by seven thousand or 13 percent while the correspond number of death rose from 41 500 to 46 100 by 4 600 or 11 percent without a doubt 1993 will enter lithuanian demograph histori as a year of demograph declin lithuania ha never experienc such a sudden and spectacular decreas in the birth rate and increas in the death rate in a time of peac at least not in thi centuri it would be nice to believ that thi will be the last such record set howev it mai be that the near futur will bring even more impress achiev such demograph fluctuat ar usual the result of econom crise such crise affect the birth rate fairli quickli and notic the public reaction to a deterior standard of live and uncertain prospect first manifest itself in the decis of famili to wait for better time marriag ar delai fewer children ar born mani countri have experienc thi in time of econom crise howev the effect of crise on death is usual consider smaller such a great increas in an alreadi high by the standard of develop countri death rate betrai a public inabl to do anyth to save live the public health and death rate ar current affect by a

standard of live it is veri difficult especi for the older gener to adapt to new condit that increas stress and therebi affect the relat ill and death rate the death rate from circulatori and psychiatr ill is rapidli increas last year the death rate from circulatori diseas increas by 13 percent more and more often we ar lose middl ag and even young peopl to these diseas the death rate ha

4 year thu we can onli sai that we have slip back by more than thirti year thi chang wa primarili the result of a greatli increas death rate among men especi in the countrysid the averag life expect of men declin in the period 1988 1993 by 4 6 year from 67 7 year in 1988 to 63 1 in 1993 and that of women by 1 7 year from 76 6 year to 74 9 year in 1993 the life expect of rural men wa 4 3 year shorter than it had been in 1959 have declin from 64 7 year to 60 4 year the differ between the life expect of men and women grew to nearli twelv year and in rural area up to 13 4 year a few year ago the averag male life span then shorter by nine year wa held up by foreign demograph as a characterist phenomenon of soviet mortal to what can we attribut the situat in 1993 some cold comfort can be taken from the fact that the declin of the averag life span coincid with a chang in the statist methodolog up until 1991 stillbirth were dealt with in accord with soviet methodolog which meant that mani infant that di soon after birth were not includ in the mortal statist howev that should have had more or less the same effect on the averag life expect of men and women it would be nice to believ that thi jump in the death rate is a temporari phenomenon the outcom of an accumul of caus the birth rate which had sharpli declin dure the first postwar decad then stabil itself and for twenti year remain at replac level i e the gener made wai for on anoth without an increas in the overal popul howev dure the last few year and especi in 1993 the birth rate fell to a level lower than had ever

not provid ground for the spread opinion that ukrain s human popul is begin to die out but the scientist argu convincingli that thi is not the case at all to a certain extent thi is a result of the fact that dure the 1960 s the level of the birth rate wa veri low and therefor now that 20 or 30 year have elaps the number of person in their child bear year is somewhat smaller than normal be that

the popul clock ha sprung on us the surpris that egypt s popul ha reach 60 283 million peopl compar to 58 million last year what about the popul minist s statement that we have been abl to control the popul explos and that there is evid respons from citizen to famili plan will our media continu to confront thi popul catastroph with televis and newspap advertis can thi danger figur motiv the govern to adopt firm decis to deal with thi problem that ha becom a matter of life or death for egypt s futur develop when will famili plan becom a nation issu and when will all faction be call upon to contribut to solv it numer question and inquiri that abound with anxieti and that ar reiter on the egyptian scene gather in my mind while i wa on my wai to interview dr mahir mahran the popul and famili affair minist who said promptli the declar figur is incorrect and it doesn t reflect the true number of egypt s popul there is an actual respons to famili plan and the number of women us contracept ha amount to 50 percent the minist ad we cannot do more than thi or issu firm decis similar to those issu by china becaus of our social circumst therefor we reli on persuas and leav the choic up to the citizen it wa natur for me to begin the dialogu with dr mahir mahran the popul and famili affair minist by ask him for an explan on the report circul by all the media sai that the popul of the arab republ of egypt ha amount to 60 283 million peopl compar to 58 million last year explain dr mahir mahran respond thi figur is incorrect becaus it doesn t reflect the true number of the popul of the arab republ of egypt when we speak of egypt s popul we shouldn t includ citizen who resid in libya and kuwait and emigr to canada and australia becaus we aren t respons for educ feed or treat them so the actual number of egypt s popul is 57 673 million peopl thi is the number with which govern offici deal when thei consid the provis of hous food school and hospit thi certainli isn t in conflict with our moral respons for expatri egyptian the popul affair minist ad the danger of the popul problem li in the fact that there is dispar between popul growth and avail resourc expatri egyptian aren t includ in these calcul we have exceed target figur al husayni far from the censu figur and from how correct thei ar you have announc that the popul explos process ha been brought under control and that the citizen have respond to famili plan if thi ha actual happen then why haven t it effect shown clearli in the popul survei mahran what i have announc is complet true the proof is that the normal popul growth rate wa 30 per 1 000 or 3 percent thi rate drop to 22 per 1 000 or 2 2 percent in 1992 moreov we have recent receiv indic confirm that normal popul growth ha drop to less than 20 per 1 000 or 2 percent thi is undoubtedli great especi if we consid the recommend of the nation popul confer that wa attend by presid husni mubarak in 1984 if we review those resolut we find that thei hope that contracept us among women would amount to 36 percent by 1991 and to 43 percent by 1996 but what ha happen and thi is confirm by statist is that contracept us among women of child bear ag amount to 47 6 percent or close to 48 percent in 1990 thi mean that in 1990 we were abl to surpass the figur target for 1996 thi percentag is signific becaus it undoubtedli reflect on the number of birth consequ statist indic that from 1991 to 1992 the number of birth drop by 100 000 al husayni mr minist thi 100 000 figur is veri small and it doesn t signifi the evid respons about which you have talk mahran when deal with thi issu we must take into account that egypt s illiteraci rate amount to 46 percent now as shown by the popul plan prepar under the supervis of 80 expert and professor repres the ministri concern univers research center and privat organ despit thi high illiteraci rate we find that there is respons among women of child bear ag to the us of contracept especi in upper egypt the proof of thi is that the popul and health survei conduct everi four year ha confirm that in some governor especi in upper egypt contracept us among women increas by 100 percent from 1988 to 1992 al husayni but statist also confirm that egypt s popul ha been increas by 1 2 million annual for sever year so why doesn t the effect of increas contracept us show in popul figur mahran popul growth is a must it exist and it will continu to exist for the next 20 25 year becaus egypt ha now a broad segment amount to nearli 45 percent the popul ag below 20 thi segment will have it turn to marri and to think of famili and of produc children thi is normal and expect continu increas al husayni thi is a foregon conclus but in light of the effort you have talk about it is possibl to reduc the increas to just 1 million instead of 1 2 million mahran thi is actual what ha been happen popul growth rose to 1 4 million annual and then drop to 1 2 million we should note that even though egypt s popul is grow steadili we have maintain thi rate of 1 2 million for sever year thi is a good sign if the respons i am talk about wasn t there thi 1 2 million figur would have increas year after year televis advertis aren t enough al husayni mr minist mani believ that at a nation popul center and then at the popul affair ministri you have reli fundament for famili plan on televis and newspap advertis you spend on thi advertis million of pound that you get either from foreign organ or from the state budget but thi isn t enough to confront egypt s popul growth problem now that it ha becom so seriou mahran to begin the phase of strong emphasi on the media ha been essenti for enlighten if you ar talk about the futil of televis advertis campaign for the educ then thi is true but the educ account for no more than 20 percent of the egyptian peopl and most of them do their own famili plan without the need for ani other parti but the rest of the egyptian peopl especi the egyptian rural popul and those who live in poor quarter and who constitut the overwhelm major of egypt s popul thei ar greatli influenc by televis and it ha produc obviou result among them for exampl televis ha dissemin inform benefici to the servic recipi whether the inform is about find the place where the servic is render or about variou type of contracept and about how to get them thi ha led to an increas number of women who frequent famili plan clinic therefor the mean of televis advertis is within the bound of our resourc and circumst an effect mean especi sinc we ar talk about a countri where the illiteraci rate amount to 46 percent china s experi al husayni other countri such as china have emploi swift mean to solv thi problem by issu firm requir that citizen observ and appli or els be expos to neg incent consequ these countri have been actual abl to deal with thi problem within a few year mahran the egyptian citizen will not accept the mean us by china especi sinc china ha emploi just two specif mean name compulsori abort and steril these mean ar prohibit by law except in a few case such as when the mother s health is in danger moreov china ha determin that urban famili will have on child and rural famili two if a citizen fail to observ thi limit he is subject to neg incent but we cannot emploi thi method in egypt the citizen will reject it and some clergymen will object to it moreov egypt s leader believ that it isn t appropri to forc citizen to implement someth through pressur and punish especi under the difficult econom circumst that egypt is experienc current and that caus hardship to mani citizen al husayni mr minist the direct caus of the econom and social crisi experienc current by egypt is the fear annual popul growth if the problem of popul inflat isn t dealt with pressur and hardship will increas year after year mahran thi is true but even if the govern agre to establish famili plan control and to compel citizen to appli them we will be surpris by a revolut by clergymen perhap even befor citizen object we will begin hear phrase such as each infant come with hi livelihood and you ar interf in god s will therefor the mean we have us so far is the mean of persuad peopl of voluntari famili plan with gentl word and without the us of coercion or pressur al husayni will you continu to us gentl and voluntari mean even if thei fail to produc the desir result thu make the popul problem more seriou and complex mahran we ar proceed along the right path but not with the requir speed thi saddl the govern with some econom burden howev the govern accept thi burden so the citizen will not experi more pressur we don t wish to speak pessimist about thi issu especi sinc there is respons to famili plan even though it isn t as quick as on desir but it suffic that we have gotten to the point where on of everi two women us contracept nation issu al husayni mr minist mani demand that we establish the popul growth issu as a nation issu to which all faction contribut their idea and effort especi sinc thi issu ha becom a matter of life or death to egypt s futur develop mahran everybodi will particip and cooper with us when he is convinc of the need for famili plan thi is what we ar try to accomplish now as a first step al husayni to deal with thi problem we can make our nation issu for the come phase the issu of appli the law that prohibit truanci at the basic educ level and that call for punish truant children i believ that appli thi law is enough to deal with a major part of the problem mahran how al husayni most urban famili ar content with on or two children becaus to these famili a child is a financi burden when it come to school food and cloth but most famili who produc a larg number of children view a child as a sourc of incom consid that such a child leav school goe into the labor market and start earn a monthli incom of 100 pound or more while still in hi tender year thi is why a child is a sourc of wealth for such famili and why thei cannot respond to or be persuad by the principl of famili plan which will depriv them of thi incom thi is the class of peopl who produc 10 or more children and who creat the popul crisi we ar all experienc now therefor if the law prohibit school truanci is appli if a fine is levi on a truant child and if the famili begin to shoulder the expens of feed cloth and educ the child it will think a thousand time befor it produc thi immens number of children mahran we have no object to adopt ani measur as long as it is in societi s interest but thi must be done in light of conclus reach by studi on thi issu howev we ar current conduct field studi in cooper with egyptian research center we await the outcom of these studi on the rural famili s size on labor among children and on school truanci number we can then make the right decis on thi issu in light of the conclus made by these studi lower servic standard al husayni so in addit to advertis in the variou media what is the ministri s plan to tackl thi problem in the come phase especi sinc on of the import reason for creat thi ministri is to confront egypt s popul growth problem mahran to start bare three month have pass sinc the ministri wa creat moreov we ar deal with all element of the popul issu not just with famili plan there is no doubt that famili plan is an import element on which we focu in our effort to solv the popul growth problem but the popul problem ha three main dimens the first dimens is increas popul growth we try to curtail thi problem through famili plan activ design to curb the rush to produc children the second dimens is the poor distribut of egypt s popul for exampl 99 percent of the popul live on a narrow strip along the nile if we redistribut the popul we will elimin numer problem we will reduc popul densiti haphazard hous terror and crime we have actual begun to work to achiev thi end if we look at egypt s map we will find that effort have been made by the govern to redistribut the popul for exampl numer new town and villag have been built in the red sea governor and citizen have begun to move there inhabit and develop them moreov a number of villag have appear along the northern coastal highwai all the wai to marsa matruh governor thi is in addit to new town in upper egypt where we find for exampl al minya and al minya al jadidah new al minya asyut and asyut al jadidah plu the town creat in recent year such as al ubur al sadat 10 ramadan 6 octob and other town all these town have been built to redistribut the popul but to accomplish thi goal greater awar is need among the popul so peopl will move and resid in these new town especi if work opportun and hous and residenti resourc ar secur for them the third dimens is the so call low standard of servic here it is requir to enhanc the standard of servic provid to the popul what i mean is that in the area of educ the number of the educ should be increas in the area of health mortal rate among infant and pregnant mother should be reduc for exampl the mortal rate among pregnant women is 174 per 100 000 thi is a veri high rate when compar with the advanc countri where the mortal rate among pregnant women is 5 11 per 100 000 pregnanc the more we enhanc the popul characterist the greater popul awar grow thu we can develop the idea of what the appropri famili size is make thi size compat with the famili s materi and social capabl which is what is happen in the west the famili plan servic plan of the ministri of popul and famili affair focus on spread health servic to villag especi sinc on half egypt s villag total 4 200 in number ar depriv of famili plan servic the plan also focus on greater us of the media in all it form on manufactur contracept local under all

if we ar live in a garbag dump text the countri is experienc an exception frighten crisi in addit to all the rest the world around us is expir natur is dy ar there ani river where the water can be drunk without fear ar there ani meadow which have not been ruin by chemic and acid rain is there ani place at all where we can breath just on whiff of truli clean air what li ahead and what is our present situat these were the question with which our interview of aleksei yablokov began he wa b yeltsin s advis on ecolog until recent and he now head the interdepartment commiss of the secur council on environment issu karpov it doe not seem that long ago that there were environment ralli and demonstr throughout the countri thei damn the bureaucrat system and torment administr hand off we will defend now we do not hear a thing yablokov i cannot deni the obviou declin of interest in ecolog but why should we be surpris by thi peopl have other problem price crime polit instabl thei worri about stai aliv about have enough to eat and about surviv bloodi massacr meanwhil the averag lifespan ha decreas dramat in recent year it wa 70 year in 1986 but now it is 65 on of the main reason is the dismiss of environment problem and it is sheer insan even in these insan time to remain silent i am alreadi 60 accord to russian standard i have no more than 10 year left but if i live in america or in switzerland i could look forward to anoth 15 18 year is thi a signific differ there i would live long enough to plai with my great grandchildren but the peopl in some citi here can onli hope to make it to retir ag why is our averag lifespan so short by civil standard i can explain from 50 to 60 percent of our longev depend on socioeconom circumst malnutrit and poor eat habit stress smoke alcohol more peopl ar dy of suicid than of ischem heart diseas traffic accid ar kill more peopl than cancer the state of our health is 20 30 percent depend on environment condit and onli 7 8 percent depend directli on health care ar our object clear we have to build highwai improv transport system and regul traffic more effect we have to fight against alcohol abus and against the poison of food with harm addit we have to protect ourselv from radiat heavi metal and dioxin around 16 percent of our territori is in a danger ecolog state and that is where more than 20 million peopl ar live now we have anoth problem an abund of toxic wast from the west is head in our direct it is thousand of time cheaper to dispos of it here and that is why it is come here through legal channel and in the major of case through illeg on as well we have no strict law to control thi and the law we do have ar not be enforc it is as if the whole countri is live in a garbag dump and is doom to degener and extinct karpov but russia is on the verg of disast the non payment crisi the endless debt work stoppag bankruptci ani fine could drive a whole industri to it knee yablokov i cannot deni that if you were to go abroad you would see how clean and neat everyth is there everyth is well kept without ani industri chao becaus each piec of land ha an owner and the owner pai for each meter obvious fine would not solv the problem not right awai but there is anoth option an enterpris director is ask to reduc harm atmospher emiss in the next two year until that time the payment of the fine is defer so to speak he can think about it ask for suggest try differ solut at the end of the two year if there ar no chang for the better pleas pai the fine thi is alreadi be practic in hundr of citi and it is essenti that the fine be spent exclus on environment project these ar two method of control on the government level but there is also a third compens for damag to properti and health in principl thi is a declar right as usual howev no specif mechan ha been develop for thi peopl do not know how and where to file claim and how to calcul the amount of compens karpov the effect of the mechan also seem dubiou how mani attempt have been made and how mani articl have been publish in the press to prove that the most harm emiss ar connect with specif enterpris all of it ha been futil the manag of product unit alwai talk their wai out of it yablokov ye it is true that prove thi is difficult but it is not imposs a few well public trial will teach them a lesson you could sai it would have an intimid effect karpov how yablokov by let them know that each of us in principl could demand ani amount of compens and that thi could absolut ruin the pollut enterpris all enterpris in the west ar live under thi damoclean sword and thi forc them to clean up their oper karpov but you ar not a foreign aleksei vladimirovich and you know what peopl here think of hazard product unit thei act upset but then thei go back to work in for instanc the radioact shop so that thei can earn higher wage get an apart and retir a few year earlier women give birth to sick children who suffer from asthma and allergi thei also get sick and then thei die prematur but thei have other concern the price of sausag and furnitur yablokov ye sadli enough that is our mental in the chernobyl zone after decontamin the local resid took the radioact soil home so that thei could keep collect funer benefit all of thi call for persuas explan convinc argument karpov by the time we convinc them there will be noth but mutant left in the countri yablokov if we do not want to admit that we ar live in a pile of crap excus the express we deserv the life we have we ar show contempt for ourselv and for the futur of our children and grandchildren then why should we worri about the drop in the birth rate and the reduct of our popul do you know that almost 60 percent of our infant ar unhealthi onli on out of everi nine or ten adolesc is healthi how did we reach thi point thi happen becaus the ussr act like a besieg fortress for decad all of it energi and resourc were us for defens under 20 percent of their worker ar emploi in industri and it is probabl that onli on out of everi twenti is work for the defens establish but in our countri on out of everi two worker is emploi in product and on out of everi five is connect with the defens establish onli 18 percent of our labor forc work in the servic sector but over there it emploi half of the labor forc karpov it seem as if the aral and caspian sea were forgotten after the breakup of the ussr yablokov not quit as soon as the ci wa form the republ conclud an ecolog agreement thei reach an agreement on monitor and the exchang of inform and also on mutual financi support at that time in 1991 thei decid to conclud separ agreement on the aral and caspian sea the agreement on the aral sea wa sign and the agreement on the caspian is be negoti lake baykal ha not been forgotten either a larg repres commiss ha been set up on the government level the azov sea ha becom a sewag pit in recent year more and more beach have been close and the fish ar dy we cannot do anyth about the azov sea without the cooper of ukrain an agreement is be draft at thi time an intern agreement wa conclud by turkei bulgaria ukrain russia and georgia to save the black

to prove that critic wa unfound that there wa no danger and that all of thi wa a figment of the report imagin yablokov ye all of the proof boil down to the argument that our agricultur and anim husbandri would collaps without these concentr now the market ha forc them to calcul their cost and realiz that it is more profit to sell the paraffin the receipt from a tonn of raw materi can pai for two tonn of soybean a tonn of paraffin meanwhil produc onli 700 kilogram of protein and vitamin concentr in addit to everyth els howev there wa the department factor and there wa alwai the strateg

that wa the start of the relianc on protein and vitamin concentr thei were suppos to lift agricultur out of the pit incident nuclear power engin also began to be develop here as a by product becaus we

economi work just five or six year ago we never even imagin anyth like thi all of thi is good for the environ we do not have to us as much land for crop or to flatten marsh and countri road with

build fire some of these restrict extend to the owner of the forest as far as the sea coast is concern the shore in most countri is public properti and there ar law against build anyth on the beach or make them inaccess karpov you were the presid s advis on ecolog did you have mani meet with bori nikolayevich yablokov unfortun thei were too infrequ last year that is on of the reason i ask the presid to releas me from my duti as an advis and give me more freedom to take action karpov did you get thi freedom yablokov i think so as the chairman of the interdepartment commiss of the secur

1 800 and we ar do better than most matern hospit in east berlin such an unpreced fall in the birth rate would have shock the former communist regim in east germani it pride itself on it wide rang of social servic aim at provid women with excel childcar facil to encourag them to have children then dai care centr were free women could take a year s paid matern leav and return to a guarante job or take off three year with gener state support and still have the same job to go back to inde more than 90 per cent of the femal work popul were emploi compar with 49 per cent in west germani by the ag of 21 east german women start have children unlik their west german counterpart who gener start a famili in their mid to late 20s despit these incent howev the birth rate in east germani wa rel low compar with most other east european countri under the communist mr jurgen dorbritz a demograph at the feder statist offic sai what we ar now see in eastern germani is a birth rate which is fall from a low base that is the worri aspect that s what make the statist so extraordinari in 1989 there were 198 922 live birth in east germani the equival of 12 birth per 1 000 or about 1 6 children per famili thi wa the same as in west germani by 1993 the number of east german birth had fallen to 79 926 or about 60 per cent of the 1989 rate the equival of 0 8 children per famili or onli half the west german level we just don t know how long thi trend will continu on thing is certain there will be veri few children born between the year 2015 and 2020 becaus of the lack of women of child bear ag can you imagin how difficult it is go to be to pai for the number of old peopl in our countri said mr dorbritz accord to the latest statist from the german associ for pension insur the number of peopl under the ag of 20 in east germani will fall from 3 84m in 1993 to 2 6m in 2020 the number of peopl ag between 20 and 60 will fall from 8 7m to 7 6m and those over 60 will rise from 3m to 4 13m the percentag of pension per 100 contributor to the state pension insur system will rise from 26 per cent in 1993 to more than 50 per cent by 2020 mr hall who ha work in the charit for 28 year believ there ar sever reason why east german women ar remain childless demograph tend to ignor the fact that we had been expect a sharp fall in the birth rate in the year 1995 regardless of unif thi is becaus the east german abort law of 1972 made abort avail on demand we knew we were not go to have mani child bear women in the mid 1990s he explain in 1972 the birth rate fell to about 6 per 1 000 climb back to about 12 birth per 1 000 todai it is fewer than 5 1 but mr hall also believ that the process of german unif itself ha had a profound social effect on east german women a young east german woman know that if she becom pregnant the chanc she will find a job ar now far less especi given the high level of unemploy he said east german women have born the brunt of unemploy which is offici 16 per cent of the work popul exclud those on short time work earli retir scheme or job creation programm by the end of the first quarter of thi year more than 790 000 east german women had lost their job repres a femal unemploy rate of 23 per cent in west germani 1 1m women or 9 3 per cent ar out of work east german women todai have freedom of choic but thei have lost their statu in societi said mr dorbritz the other pressur aris from unif is that mani east german women have had to seek new qualif retrain or chang job more often unlik the former dai when a job wa for life there is no more secur the widespread sens of uncertainti ha plai a major role in the declin of the birth rate said mr dorbritz the freedom to travel ha plai it part in the declin of the birth rate as well young east german women have an unpreced chanc to go abroad befor thei settl and start a famili there wa hardli anyth els to do befor 1989 said mr dorbritz east german societi wa gear toward encourag young women to procreat all those social plank of free kindergarten both parent in a job heavili subsidis or free children s cloth and shoe have now disappear greater mobil and open border have led to a sharp rise in migrat from east germani to west germani more than 1 2m from a popul of 17m east german went to live in west germani between late 1989 and earli 1991 mani of these peopl were young and skill said mr nichola eberstadt a demograph at the american enterpris institut for public polici research of the overal drop in the birth rate roughli on ninth can be attribut to the sheer declin of east germani s popul dure those two year staff at the charit hospit know that unless the birth rate increas the obstetrician doctor and nurs could be without a job we have 2 000 bed here said mr hall befor unif we were deal with more than 2 200 women a year if we cannot account for all the bed we will be under pressur to make save that mean cut job but hi main concern is the kind of societi which will evolv in east germani in the next centuri the prognosi is veri bad said mr hall i do not know how we ar go to fend for the elderli who is go to pai for them on answer might be to allow immigr into the countri under a quota system to replenish the popul a solut advanc by some liber on thing is clear mr eberstadt believ that if the present trend in east germani continu it will be virtual imposs for what he call gener replac to occur for gener replac eastern germani s women of child bear ag todai would have to give birth to an averag of about 2 07 infant over the cours of their live thei ar now have 0 8 children less than on birth per woman per lifetim thi is not enough for a net popul replac
