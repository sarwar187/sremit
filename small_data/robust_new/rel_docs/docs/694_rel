foundat for a cheap summer in the garden the weather ha turn in your favour and ha rememb how to rain the effort is minim and the skill is not much greater you need some seed packet a rake and a will to experi if you need somebodi to talk you through it we have a new dialogu of expert to help us the dialogu is conduct by christoph lloyd and graham rice and is publish as garden flower from seed pound 17 99 vike thei do not hold a dialogu as socrat seem to have understood on a sort of bulli match in which the senior expert christoph lloyd is allow to tie a younger question into knot instead both partner exchang view without too mani disagr but in a chatti tone which mai not suit all reader the result is a doubl edg insight into some of garden s great mysteri over them all hang the realli big puzzl why will some seed grow so easili while other sit and sulk there ar lesser mysteri on the wai through why do petunia seedl sometim fizzl out why should you never sow mallow in the same place year after year why do some verbena germin and other come to noth what ar the ground rule for bizzi lizzi if you do not wish to bui it in june at more than pound 1 a plant fortun both partner in the dialogu seem to agre with my favourit thei mere disagre about on of the method thi weekend i will be sow seed directli into open ground the simplest of all procedur loosen up a bare patch of earth rake it over press it with the back of the rake to make a seri of straight seed drill about half an inch deep arrang these straight drill at variou angl so that you do not end up with noth but a straight long line sow the seed directli and press the soil back over them with gentl pressur from the rake s head hold the rake itself upright follow rice and disagre with lloyd who prefer to broadcast the seed irregularli i find thi habit extravag and harder to control as it result progress most varieti no longer need a greenhous in mai and certainli do not need daili attent you can sow them on a saturdai afternoon water them again on a sundai even if the weather is hot and forget the entir escapad until the next weekend but on or two by then seedl ought to be show my first instinct is to make a beelin for the blue love in a mist the miss jekyl varieti and dark blue phacelia the expert agre on my experi that both of these transplant badli like poppi or mignonett you need to leav a few plant in each seed drill without disturb have thin out their unwant neighbour a week or so after germin i am also fond of the easi echium blue bedder although lloyd complain that it onli last for two or three week i find that it will pull itself togeth for a second season if you cut it veri hard after the first flower among tall varieti we all agre on malop the big mallow but it is not often stock in shop seed rack i also like rose lilac agrostemma which lloyd shrewdli suggest as a good pot plant you have to stake it when young in order to agre with him it is not clear what the expert think about the bright white lavatera mont blanc lloyd complain about it but the book give it a glamor full colour plate rice is good on the purpl flower swan river daisi which he wise recommend for hang basket becaus it will put up with drought it need heat howev in order to germin what final about seed box and compost i us old flora margarin box or the small plastic pot in which plant come nowadai from nurseri the expert agre sure rightli that pot ar more conveni as you can sow mani more varieti in a small space do not bother with big plastic trai the dai have also pass in which we had to us wooden seed box fresh from fishmong and smell of kipper on compost the two of them ar still stuck with peat but mostli as part of a gener compost person i have never us peat at all i have prefer good top soil from the garden which is carefulli siev like flour and mix with leaf mould and sharp sand i have also us vermiculit and perlit both of which help seed to germin howev both
