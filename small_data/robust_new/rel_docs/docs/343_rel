continu with the newroz feast of the kurd and will final end with the march 27 local elect which will effect both the kurd and the turk these three import event will take place within on week of each other the widespread belief held by the public is that the local elect will not be held in a complet safe environ there ar report alreadi which predict that both the state and the outlaw kurdistan worker parti pkk will exert pressur on each other dure the elect the first exampl of such pressur wa experienc in cizr cizr is a district that is mostli influenc by the pkk and for thi reason the state is attach special import to thi district and take similar measur in other settlement the most obviou element of such measur is that suburb ar be evacu and villag guard ar be settl there the commun which ar forc out of their settlement dure these oper ar also miss out on their opportun to vote it is report that about 1 5 million peopl in southern and southeastern anatolia ar be forc to migrat the excit and the tension of the march 27 local elect have alreadi begun in the western part of the countri almost all parti candid ar be announc and elect campaign have start howev there is nobodi in southern and southeastern anatolia who ha announc hi or her candidatur for the mayor elect as yet with the except of on or two almost everi candid s name is be kept secret follow the outlaw kurdistan worker parti s boycott the polit parti ar keep the name of their candid secret for secur reason the pro kurdish democraci parti dep is also reluct to announc it candid for fear of repris the other common element among the parti is that thei all feel that the march elect will not be held in a safe environ the sourc of thi suspicion is the predict that both the govern and the pkk will appli pressur on each other dure the elect it is necessari to point out though that the commun live in thi region do not want such pressur or elect rig both seem imposs to avoid for on thing the govern is afraid that the pkk will support the democraci parti s mayor candid and us the elect as a referendum to bring them onto the intern polit platform to argu for the kurdish caus the other worri is that the pkk will argu that the elect result ar invalid becaus of the pressur the govern ha exert on the candid of the democraci parti and will again try to us thi as ammunit against turkei at the intern level and boycott the elect result everybodi in the region is curiou about the pkk attitud toward the local elect the pkk ha not express ani opinion about the elect as yet there ar report that it will make a statement on februari 15 about the local elect it is fear that if the pkk call for non particip in the local elect there will be a reduct in the number of vote in the region and the pkk will us thi as a referendum to argu it case thi ha proven to be the least favor option so far dep leader hatip dicl s remark we mai reach an histor decis and not take part in the elect is on element that add

referendum almost everybodi seem to agre that the result of the local elect will be in the pkk favor the pkk is aim to win at least 200 local govern post in the southeast as the pkk make these calcul the govern is make prepar to ensur that the elect take place as a result of amend made earlier member of the arm forc will be abl to vote at the local elect with their weapon in their hand certain

author sai the ballot box will be taken by helicopt to a safe place for count recent newspap report sai that some 150 000 addit soldier have been sent to the region in prepar for the elect observ point out what the pkk will do is not certain but suspect that it will attack poll booth at which the arm forc will cast their vote in order to ensur that the govern doe not have the chanc to chang the elect result on fact is that the pkk ha forbidden all polit parti from take part in the elect all parti except the welfar parti rp and the nationalist movement parti mhp have obei thi order for thi reason parti ar have difficulti in find and endors mayor candid in the region as the candid will be the first target cizr is a battlefield as the date for the local elect draw closer the fight in

continu with the newroz feast of the kurd and will final end with the march 27 local elect which will effect both the kurd and the turk these three import event will take place within on week of each other the widespread belief held by the public is that the local elect will not be held in a complet safe environ there ar report alreadi which predict that both the state and the outlaw worker parti of kurdistan pkk will exert pressur on each other dure the elect the first exampl of such pressur wa experienc in cizr cizr is a district that is mostli influenc by the pkk and for thi reason the state is attach special import to thi district and take similar measur in other settlement the most obviou element of such measur is that suburb ar be evacu and villag guard ar be settl there the commun which ar forc out of their settlement dure these oper ar also miss out on their opportun to vote it is report that about 1 5 million peopl in south and southeastern anatolia ar be forc to

nobodi in south and southeastern anatolia who ha announc hi or her candidatur for the mayor elect as yet with the except of on or two almost everi candid s name is be kept secret follow the outlaw kurdistan worker parti s boycott the polit parti ar keep the name of their candid secret for secur reason the pro kurdish democraci parti dep is also reluct to announc it candid for fear of repris the other common element among the parti is that thei all feel that the march elect will not be held in a safe environ the sourc of thi suspicion is the predict that both the govern and the pkk will appli pressur on each other dure the elect it is necessari to point out though that the commun live in thi region do not want such pressur or elect rig both seem imposs to avoid for on thing the govern is afraid that the pkk will support the democraci parti s mayor candid and us the elect as a referendum to bring them onto the intern polit platform to argu for the kurdish caus the other worri is that the pkk will argu that the elect result ar invalid becaus of the pressur the govern ha exert on the candid of the democraci parti and will again try to us thi as ammunit against turkei at the intern level and boycott the elect result everybodi in the region is curiou about the pkk attitud toward the local elect the pkk ha not express ani opinion about the elect as yet there ar report that it will make a statement on feb 15 about the local elect it is fear that if the pkk call for non particip in the local elect there will be a reduct in the number of vote in the region and the pkk will us thi as a referendum to argu it case thi ha proven to be the least favor option so far dep leader hatip dicl s remark we mai reach a histor decis and not take part in the elect is on element that add weight to thi theori on other possibl outcom is that the pkk regard the result of an elect which it ha boycot to be to it advantag in short the pkk will try in ani case to us the elect result as it referendum almost everybodi seem to agre that the result of the local elect will be in the pkk favor the pkk is aim to win at least 200 local govern post in the southeast as the pkk make these calcul the govern is make prepar to ensur that the elect take place as a result of amend made earlier member of the arm forc will be abl to vote at the local elect with their weapon in their hand certain

author sai the ballot box will be taken by helicopt to a safe place for count recent newspap report sai that some 150 000 addit soldier have been sent to the region in prepar for the elect observ point out what the pkk will do is not certain but suspect that it will attack poll booth at which the arm forc will cast their vote in order to ensur that the govern doe not have the chanc to chang the elect result on fact is that the pkk ha forbidden all polit parti from take part in the elect all parti except the welfar parti rp and the nationalist movement parti mhp have obei thi order for thi reason parti ar have difficulti in find and endors mayor candid in the region as the candid will be the first target cizr is a battlefield as the date for the local elect draw closer the fight in
