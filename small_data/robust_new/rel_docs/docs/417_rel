FBIS3-36336: languag russian articl type bfn interview with sergei yushenkov head of state duma defens committe by oleg odnokolenko place and date of interview not given sergei yushenkov defens should not be subject of polit quarrel text sergei nikolayevich yushenkov wa born in tver oblast in 1950 he graduat from the novosibirsk higher militari polit colleg and the militari polit academi he is a colonel and candid of philosoph scienc in 1990 he wa elect a russian soviet feder socialist republ peopl s deputi sinc 1992 he ha been first deputi leader of the russian feder feder inform center he now head the state duma defens committe odnokolenko sergei nikolayevich you ar now quit a well known figur nonetheless hi public statement give a veri superfici idea of a man s inner world what do you live by what ar your world view and ideal yushenkov the answer to that question is a lengthi on my view have undergon a quit substanti evolut there wa a time when i like mani peopl in our countri wa carri awai by communist idea actual even now i consid it true to assert that the comprehens develop of each person is an essenti condit for the comprehens develop of all it is anoth matter that it wa consider later that i discov that thi idea is not actual a communist on but rather a gener human on that becam clear when i wa abl to read other book not onli the recommend on on histori and philosophi actual the process of my reassess of valu wa not that simpl or rapid back at the novosibirsk higher militari polit colleg my comrad and i reach the conclus that someth complet differ from what wa written in the textbook wa be implement in the countri in practic and we tri to creat thi wa in the second year a genuin marxist leninist parti we even held sever secret session with all the attribut appropri in such case in gener it must be said that at that time secret organ were a kind of epidem and specif in militari polit colleg these organ appear at the leningrad and donetsk colleg and other humanitarian higher educ establish as a result mani boi were put in prison we avoid that fate why to be honest we were frighten and took no further step but that is not the onli reason even then we realiz that there wa noth left to perfect the document which we had draft in secret with great exert could be categor as communist or rather social democrat odnokolenko how big wa your organ yushenkov big enough about 15 peopl what surpris me pleasantli to thi dai is that there were no traitor among us that mean we knew how to choos friend and even now we ar pleas to meet incident we dissolv our secret organ on a suffici plausibl pretext we said we still did not know much so we could not assess correctli what wa happen in the countri it wa decid that each of us must enter the academi becaus onli there wa broader access to the sourc of knowledg possibl that wa somewhat naiv of cours but what els could be expect from young boi odnokolenko but later you not onli graduat from the militari polit academi but also taught in it incident what cours did you read yushenkov i read logic and dialect and histor materi but mostli dialect materi odnokolenko how wa a teacher preach democrat convict receiv in the polit academi yushenkov when i for on read lectur and said that we need a multiparti system and privat ownership for everi possibl reason initi thi gener keen hostil not onli with the parti commiss but also with the student themselv but later when proof and refer to the classic marxist writer had been cite the tone of our talk chang of cours it wa mainli creativ peopl who enter the militari polit academi although thei were adept of communist ideolog if there wa a need to investig someth thei would go to the root to the essenc onli the most slow wit resist the obviou odnokolenko consequ we should not be surpris that it wa from the militari polit academi and other polit and humanitarian higher educ establish that there emerg peopl who were the first to critic their own convict yushenkov take the church in which milieu did heresi first aris among the adept of religion there is noth surpris in that who could know the true situat better than it own peopl odnokolenko nonetheless when at what time did you final burn your bridg so to speak and switch to the democrat camp yushenkov in about 1987 after i had defend my dissert i began to engag activ in a studi of the inform movement in the countri just in case i thought up a cover for myself i said i wa collect materi for my doctor s thesi but in fact i wa meet with likemind peopl and test the accuraci of my view odnokolenko which democrat leader of the time most influenc your view yushenkov i am not on of those whose convict can easili be influenc i have never blindli follow ani author most often i made decis for myself and made my wai independ not under anyon s influenc but under the influenc of the condit which had actual taken shape in the countri but of cours there wa some influenc but not onli person do you rememb what item were publish at the time in newspap and journal how mani disput there were even the academi name for lenin resembl a beehiv that had been stir up odnokolenko now all that is in the past big chang have occur in your fate you have becom chairman of the state duma defens committe incident how do you see the defens committe in thi scenario yushenkov it seem to me that thi is on of the committe in which an excess politic natur should not predomin first of all the defens committe should accord with it main function be concern for the legal backup for the countri s defens and legisl guarante for the right of servicemen and their famili natur the approv of the defens budget is also the committe s respons that is perhap the main thing right now odnokolenko what is the disposit of polit forc in the committe right now yushenkov the committe ha been join by repres of the liber democrat parti russia s choic the communist parti the agrarian parti women of russia and so forth but to judg from the first session i hope that such a broad spectrum of polit prioriti will not have an advers effect on our work sinc as we can alreadi see everyon is well awar that defens should not be the subject of polit disput odnokolenko what about the legaci bequeath to us from the russian feder suprem soviet committe for question of defens and secur will it be suitabl yushenkov we treat with respect the activ of our predecessor and will try to retain continu especi as aleksandr piskunov who wa deputi chairman in the former committe ha becom my deputi in brief the good thing work out by our predecessor will be retain without fail and the develop which thei did not manag to implement and which ar of valu we shall try to implement but with regard to the new condit odnokolenko but on the other hand not all legisl act on militari question which your predecessor launch have prove workabl yushenkov that is true so on of our prioriti task is to carri out an inventori of all law to investig which articl ar not work and to decid what to do whether to back up these articl with the relev life support mechan or whether to alter them it is entir possibl that thei were adopt as it were in the abstract in isol from realiti in brief we must investig odnokolenko i realiz the question is probabl prematur but anywai perhap the present defens committe alreadi ha it own legisl propos yushenkov ye it doe have such propos thei ar mainli connect with put a more thorough legal basi under the reform of the armi odnokolenko so much is said about the armi and what is said is so divers that it is time to specifi what content you person put into thi term yushenkov the armi should becom a profession armi that is alreadi axiomat but the armi s transit to a profession basi should be implement with a consider for the real econom situat otherwis we will simpli fail and our plan will remain onli plan odnokolenko as far as i rememb previous parliament did not alwai find a common languag with the defens ministri it wa particularli difficult at first now everyth is start from the begin yushenkov life is a complex thing and the futur will show how our relat with the militari depart take shape but the fact that from the veri first session of the committe thei have been attend by a defens ministri repres instil the confid and hope that there will be product collabor and we do not want it ani other wai it is simpli mad to work ani other wai odnokolenko ye but in my opinion the problem is more complex after all you will have to check your posit not onli with the defens ministri but also with specif state structur moreov you will have to take someon s side on vex issu yushenkov in my view the parliamentari defens committe should not be a kind of lobbi instrument for the arm forc but nor ar we oppon of the militari depart we have a common interest the countri s defens capabl therefor i stress onc again in realiti we have on path left the path of agreement and collabor which incident doe not rule out and in no wai imped the separ of function odnokolenko although our talk ha not been on an econom subject we can hardli avoid thi problem why do you believ the democrat have not manag to complet fulfil their econom commit to societi yushenkov that is the etern problem of the failur of aim and the result of activ to coincid if everyth were to coincid ideal there would be no problem but that is never what happen odnokolenko but perhap it ha all come out thi wai becaus the democrat lack cohes and purpos for instanc when thei came to power the bolshevik unless of cours the sourc lie work more harmoni and selflessli yushenkov that is probabl not the point the democrat in gener do not know how to wield power that is both their merit and their shortcom it wa not for noth that churchil said that democraci is the worst form of govern but man ha not yet thought up anyth better that mean there is on thing left we must learn how to govern 
FBIS3-59325: languag chines articl type cso articl by wu qingp affili with the polici research offic of the cpc yueyang municip committe edit by xi ling the gener polit demand of the market economi and parti construct text we must studi the issu of do a good job of carri out parti construct under the situat character by the develop of a socialist market economi in view of the gener polit demand of the market economi i parti construct must meet gener polit demand of market economi accord to marxism polit is a concentr manifest of econom the market economi is a social system which is base on the uniti of econom and polit the self construct of our parti as the polit group exercis leadership over the develop of a socialist market economi must certainli meet the gener demand of the market economi if we reject the idea that parti construct must meet the gener demand of the market economi we will not be abl to truli do a good job of carri out parti construct nor can we develop a true market economi reap the victori of reach a socialist market economi as a creation in human histori the polit of a socialist market economi doe not have a readi made model to follow on the other hand over the sever hundr year sinc it wa born the market economi ha acquir a rather matur form of polit and accumul rich polit achiev with regard to the question of how to discov the gener polit demand of the market economi through examin the vari and complex polit phenomena of market economi countri and of how to consult and draw on what is discov in view of the actual situat regard the construct of our parti i believ that emphasi should be given to grasp three kei point first we must discov the gener polit demand of the market economi through examin particular situat mao zedong ha point out in term of the order of it movement human knowledg alwai grow by chang gradual from be knowledg about individu and particular thing into be knowledg about gener thing footnot 1 mao zedong xuanji p 285 whether in analyz the gener polit demand of the market economi or in explor the wai to enhanc parti construct in view of such demand it is alwai necessari to persist in achiev knowledg about the particular befor achiev knowledg about the gener thi requir us to clearli understand the situat and polit characterist of the market economi countri and to analyz the develop track of those countri market economi as well as their polit experi and lesson so as to deriv the gener polit demand of the market economi such gener demand should be consid to repres the essenti element and a rough outlin of the rich polit practic of each countri the gener polit demand of the market economi to be discuss below includ the three element of the rule of law democraci and check and balanc which repres just the rough summar of the common element of the polit of the develop market economi countri second we must persist in be creativ be creativ repres the spirit of the era of open up and competit if parti construct is to meet the gener demand of the market economi we must try hard to be creativ rather than simpli copi the specif polit form of a particular countri to try hard to be creativ we must have a master spirit character by a high sens of respons to the parti and the peopl handl tradit thing in a scientif wai on the on hand we must realiz that we have mani fine tradit which still need to be carri forward and develop under the new situat on the other hand we must also realiz that under the condit of the market economi parti construct we cannot reli on tradit alon and that we must dare to think dare to break a new path and dare to take risk on an overal level we must regard the three benefit a notion propos by deng xiaop as the goal of creativ effort we must make bold design carri out bold practic activ and make time adjust on the basi of be guid by that goal so as to ensur that there ar new breakthrough and improv in parti construct third we must persist in gradual implement thing make parti construct meet the gener demand of the market economi is a major reform and the relev process involv variou sphere therefor we must overcom impati and proce with thi work in a step by step manner we must formul work plan in a scientif wai and do a good job of manag the reform trial point we must make a greater us of modern commun mean in the effort to spread inform about reform to variou place around the countri ii do a good job of carri out the parti s system construct in accord with the demand of the legal system the market economi is an economi base on a legal system under a market economi the product forc ar greatli liber peopl s enthusiasm and creativ have greatli increas and competit in societi is especi fierc to ensur equal competit and overal effici and to prevent encroach upon other peopl s right we must impos norm on peopl s conduct through establish and maintain social contract relationship for a long time we have fail to give suffici emphasi to legal system work parti construct ha mainli consist of ideolog construct while system construct ha been neglect as should be point out the parti s ideolog construct led to tremend achiev in the war year and in the earli period of the prc as well as mani achiev after the start of reform and open up for instanc activ such as the larg scale discuss of the criteria of truth in 1978 and the emancip think movement of recent year surround deng xiaop s speech on three benefit plai a veri larg role in educ unit and improv the whole parti howev the attempt at mainli reli on ideolog construct without carri out system construct is unlik to suit a modern societi or to result in parti construct be carri out in a satisfactori manner first fundament the superstructur is condit by the econom base in gener the effect of ideolog construct is determin by the level of develop of the product forc of societi and by the degre of ration of social relat among peopl therefor in develop a socialist market economi it is all the more necessari to give emphasi to system construct and to maintain and improv the standard of parti construct through reli on the infrastructur which impos norm on relat among peopl in a scientif wai second from an oper perspect there ar mani difficulti in ideolog construct for instanc theoret develop is lag behind and it is thu difficult to improv peopl s understand interest relationship intersect each other and ar complex peopl s mind ar get increasingli complic and some ar not match their word with their deed result in difficulti in grasp the real result and as the relev work is greatli affect by personnel turnov it is difficult to consolid result in comparison system construct involv rel small oper difficulti and is conduc to ensur order and stabil as earli as 1980 deng xiaop made the sorrow summar comment our past mistak of variou kind sure had much to do with some leader think and style but the problem in the organiz system and the work system were even more import he also point out the issu of system ha a bear on whether the parti and state will chang their color and must elicit high attent from the entir parti footnot 2 deng xiaop wenxuan p 293 as recent as dure the southern inspect last year deng xiaop again sincer admonish us it remain necessari to reli on the legal system and it is more reliabl to us the legal system approach the issu of how to do a good job of carri out the parti s system construct need to be continu explor theoret and in practic roughli two aspect should be given special emphasi on aspect is the set of criteria the system repres the norm govern conduct of all in the parti and there must be some criteria us for determin what kind of system can be consid satisfactori 1 requir should be scientif time ar chang and there should also be system chang requir on parti member in time of war should be differ from those in time of peac in time of peac requir on parti member under the situat of a plan economi should be differ from those under the situat of a market economi and emphasi should be place on differ thing in differ stage of market economi construct there should be systemat scientif rule on all those matter 2 the content should be concret that is there should be specif clear and easili grasp rule on what everyon is requir to do what everyon is requir not to do how on is to do the requir thing and which approach ar not to be us 3 the procedur should be without loophol we must formul regul which dovetail each other close so as to reduc as much as possibl the impact of the human factor in the cours of enforc the regul the other aspect is the formul of a system framework present it is proper to consid divid the parti s framework of system into three block 1 organiz system thei mainli includ some basic rule on organiz form and chang at the variou level in the parti for instanc the organiz command system the elect system encompass such thing as enhanc elect district rule as well as inner parti speech make and question answer the question system the evalu system rule on dismiss and impeach procedur rule on personnel arrang concern the execut organ of organ at variou level and regul on the parti s full time worker the parti s lawyer and profession parti cadr 2 meet relat system meet constitut an import form of our parti s activ and must be standard in view of the overal situat at present the main task for the present time should be to press ahead with the construct of the six meet relat system that is the parti committe system the plenari meet system the system of the congress of parti member repres the annual parti member confer system the parti member discuss meet system and the democrat life meet system 3 work relat system the parti s work involv mani thing as far as inner parti work is concern the system on which work should be done includ the parti member studi and train system the system of report on on s work the system of lead cadr s work at the grass root and job rotat the person wealth declar system the examin and evalu system the system of parti disciplin sanction the system of relai inform on the parti s intern affair the parti organ and parti journal system the system of protect of parti member right and the parti s intern financi manag system iii do a good job of carri out the parti s organiz construct so as to meet the democraci demand democraci is on of the major compon of polit modern and also a fundament polit characterist of the market economi in a broad sens democraci refer to let peopl themselv decid matter affect their own self interest and to the full realiz of autonomi on the part of variou social actor within the scope defin by law why doe a market economi have more vigor than a plan economi a fundament differ is that while a market economi contain innumer highli autonom function actor a plan economi follow a model character by a unifi and central wai of do thing and the micro level actor in such an economi ar extrem lack in autonomi and would function onli when given variou command by the superior and that therefor such an economi show mani diseas of ossif to make the parti s work meet the demand for democrat polit rais by the market economi we must focu such work on the parti s organiz construct organ refer to a system s intern structur relationship and the relev subsystem whether the system is function strong and whether the system is power ar to a larg extent determin by whether the intern relationship ar proper and by the amount of vigor of it subsystem enhanc organiz construct accord to the democrat spirit is undoubtedli conduc to rectifi the structur relationship in a system and to invigor the subsystem enhanc the parti s leadership doe not just mean enhanc nation leadership under a situat character by the develop of a market economi it is even more import to enhanc the concret leadership exercis by parti organ of all level in all sector when there is order in the provinc there is order nationwid onli by give full plai to the initi of all parti organ and arous enthusiasm on the part of all sector would it be possibl to truli do a good job of develop our social and econom caus to have a solid foundat for the parti s leadership and to have the effort to enhanc the parti s leadership produc real effect ten of thousand of parti organ ar scatter around in all corner of social life the enhanc of their self construct through democrat mean and their present themselv as live model befor the mass will be of veri profound and far reach signific to acceler the polit and econom democrat and the modern process of china with regard to the issu of how to meet the democraci demand and do a good job of carri out the parti s organiz construct it seem proper to consid the follow sever point the first is to deleg power so as to increas the combat effect of organ in the current period of transit from a plan economi to a market economi the overal task remain to adjust and deleg the power which have been character by excess central we must turn each parti organ which is directli engag in practic work into an autonom power center so as to enhanc it combat effect the second is to maintain inner parti transpar so as to strengthen the cohes of the organ we must ensur smooth inform exchang within the parti especi between the superior and subordin inform all parti member of import matter insid and outsid the parti and hold regular and nonregular discuss meet of parti member encourag parti member to speak their mind freeli and to share the parti s care and burden make repres to parti congress perman repres and clearli defin their term of refer and duti hold relev meet regularli to discuss the relev work to improv the qualiti of democrat life meet we must have repres of subordin organ attend the democrat life meet of superior organ the third is to make the relat between the parti and the mass closer so as to increas the vital of the organ we must do a good job of conduct investig and studi it is proper for lead parti cadr to work at the grassroot job under their supervis on a regular basi while retain their posit and lead parti cadr current hold offic should meet the mass on a regular basi iv do a good job of build the parti s supervis mechan so as to meet the demand concern check and balanc power is an abil to control matter power in human societi is a human abil to control social object as the market economi entail the most extens fair competit and contain differ kind of self interest econom actor it must be equip with comprehens and complet check on and balanc against all power in societi and will in no wai allow self interest actor not govern by the principl of fair to control societi in an unconstrain manner onli in thi wai would it be possibl to ensur that societi is live but not chaotic with thing in order a concret analysi will show that there ar check on and balanc against power everywher in a market economi societi as far as the numer commod produc ar concern their highli autonom busi decisionmak is fundament constrain by market demand and the product factor condit enjoi by the produc as far as the variou local powerhold actor ar concern their high degre of autonomi is constrain by the law of the state and the state s regul and control mean mainli fiscal as well as by the wish of the peopl under the respect jurisdict as for the suprem central powerhold actor thei ar also effect supervis and constrain by variou parti an exampl would be the phenomenon of the three wai separ of power in the unit state our parti is the rule parti and the central repres of the state power of all level therefor a kei to meet the market economi s demand concern check on and balanc against power is to do a good job of build the parti s supervis mechan from an overal perspect the parti s supervis situat wa in the past character by supervis relationship base on supervis exercis by superior over subordin or superior center supervis relationship while horizont supervis and supervis exercis by subordin the mass over superior leader were rel rare through reform in recent year the highli central system ha been gradual dismantl and superior subordin type supervis relationship have been greatli weaken while other supervis relationship have not been strengthen the present state of affair character by a lack of supervis and power imbal ha inevit creat tremend difficulti for our caus first corrupt becom unavoid the histori of polit develop whether ancient or contemporari and whether chines or foreign show that unconstrain power will inevit lead to corrupt there is no deni the fact that we do have mani excel communist who becaus of their firmli held parti spirit ar abl to resist corrupt and remain uncorrupt but there ar also mani parti member who becaus of a lack of supervis ar more or less corrupt by their inflat selfish desir under the impact of the tide of the market economi the new media s report on ten case of crime commit by degener parti member collect by thi author in a casual manner show that those involv in nine of the case had such posit as factori director manag section chief and divis chief as well as such enviabl honor titl as the advanc model shock worker holder of the mai first medal constitut a share of 90 percent thi exampl can more effect demonstr that it is difficult for unsupervis power not to lead to corrupt second it ha becom difficult to deepen the reform as must be point out an import error in past reform effort ha been that attent ha been given onli to the deleg and recentr of power but not to check on and balanc against power such an error ha to a larg extent creat the situat in which reform is unstabl and difficult to deepen in term of root caus such current problem as those of local formal the grow strength shown by sector interest enterpris mechan not be invigor low effici embezzl and corrupt financi disord and counterfeit and shoddi good ar all close relat to the error third it is difficult to consolid the parti s power from a long term and development perspect whether the parti s leadership can be solidifi doe not mainli depend on whether the parti now hold power or not but is more importantli determin by how power is us and by how the reform and construct caus led by the parti progress if corrupt is widespread lead to a great deal of problem it would be veri difficult to keep the parti s leadership power solidifi and the caus of establish a socialist market economi in china would be face great danger if on is to do a good job of carri out the construct of the parti s supervis mechan so as to meet the market economi s demand concern check on and balanc against power it seem necessari to chang the framework of the parti s supervis mechan from be a plane triangl into be a solid triangl the past superior center power system in the parti can be seen as a plane triangl each powerhold actor who is part of the triangl is in gener constrain onli by it superior when there ar chang in the power structur that is power deleg or when the check and balanc at the superior level ar not work in a fair manner lead to phenomena like the bureaucrat tendenc and the small group tendenc powerhold actor would be in an unsound situat character by the absenc of constraint on the other hand as the structur of power assum the shape of a plane figur the structur as a whole would be lack in stabil a complet and proper system of check on and balanc against power should be in the shape of a solid triangl that is each powerhold actor is constrain both by it superior and by the relev powerhold actor on the same level in thi wai the power system as a whole will be consolid specif there ar two aspect to be discuss first do a good job of carri out the superior s supervis and constrain of the subordin in term of the overal situat it is necessari both to deleg power and enliven the situat so as to accommod the market economi and to satisfi modern societi s need for orderli manag 1 keep control over provinc and releas citi for provinc ar larg while citi ar small the provinc repres the highest level of local power and the citi repres a lower level of local power a provinc s situat is much more complex than a citi s situat and therefor we must keep comprehens control over the appoint of member of the provinci leadership team while keep control over onli the chief of the municip leadership team 2 weaken vertic sector control most of the exist powerhold agenc of variou level and their vertic wai of control all have to a great extent the color of a plan economi in the futur except such necessari vertic control as those over taxat custom the militari and the polic vertic control should be weaken as much as possibl and some agenc should be dismantl on the basi of consider of the relev situat 3 the mean of control should be chang as soon as possibl except for the case of the appoint and dismiss of lead personnel and vertic control mention abov the us of administr mean should be reduc as much as possibl campaign and focu work in particular should be reduc we must perfect legal mean and strengthen econom mean particularli we must resolv the problem of the weak of central fiscal mean second do a good job of carri out horizont supervis exercis by parti organ of the same level over each other 1 fulli develop the function of disciplinari commiss dure the period when such institut as the peopl s congress ar still lack in the capabl for supervis it is necessari for disciplinari commiss to becom powerhold actor check and balanc against power and to supervis parti committe of the same level we must studi and increas the supervis task of each disciplinari commiss in view of the need to abid by parti disciplin and the law of the state as well as the need of the develop of the local reform and construct caus we must merg disciplinari commiss with such agenc as the supervisori and anticorrupt agenc so as to improv overal effici 2 the secretari of a disciplinari commiss should be elect by all the parti member of the parti organ of the same level and the candid should as much as possibl go through the relev entri speechmak and question answer procedur accord to usual elect practic the secretari of a disciplinari commiss should be subject to period elect and be abl to get re elect consecut 3 scientif defin the task and work method of disciplinari commiss we must clearli give disciplinari commiss variou inspect task and make personnel arrang in view of the amount of work to be done in addit to routin inspect disciplinari commiss must also be given the task of conduct random inspect thei should do a good job of keep record so as to facilit the truth evalu of the work of the parti organ of the same level as well as the disciplinari commiss own work 4 a disciplinari commiss should report to perman repres of the parti member on it work the secretari of a disciplinari commiss and relev respons person should report to all the parti member on their work everi year and answer the question rais by parti member

FT911-4165: ft 20 apr 91 the man who make hi emot danc controversi choreograph sir kenneth macmillan sir kenneth macmillan princip choreograph of the royal ballet ha been controversi ever sinc he stage hi first profession ballet at sadler s well theatr as a young dancer in 1955 he ha sinc becom on of the most import forc in the danc of our time he repres the second gener of creativ at the royal ballet after the found figur dame ninett de valoi and sir frederick ashton like them he wa director of the royal ballet from 1970 to 1977 hi belief about the potenti of danc to explor the human condit hi determin that hi work must reflect not the fantasi of 19th centuri swan up but the emot crise known to men and women todai have sometim made audienc uneasi iron hi full length ballet romeo and juliet manon mayerl ar among covent garden s greatest draw and have achiev the statu of repertori classic while hi short work ar eagerli acquir by compani worldwid he remain as alwai a veri privat man whose chief concern is still with find new possibl for movement i never sat down and thought about what ballet should do in the theatr but earli in my career i knew that what i want to put on stage had to have more realiti than much of what i wa see in the 1940s and 50s that might seem strang when on consid what an artifici medium ballet is with it women on point and it formal languag the whole aesthet of ballet is not about realiti but i wa at odd with everyon who want ballet to continu to be tradit i wa influenc by other aspect of the theatr and i recal an articl by john osborn whom i admir veri much in which he spoke of ballet as be effet littl of what i wa see then had ani contact with a real world of feel and human behaviour ballet look like window dress i want to make ballet in which an audienc would becom caught up with the fate of the charact i show them the onli wai to get the sort of express i aim for wa to know how the charact felt and find a mean of show that i want danc to express someth larg outsid it experi i had to find a wai to stretch the languag otherwis i should just produc steril academ danc even so the languag had to remain veri precis in some of the work i have done which i like best the movement came swiftli in the solo i recent made for anthoni dowel as the tragic ineffectu husband in winter dream and in the grief duet in isadora when duncan and pari singer hear of the death of isadora s children thi is on of the rawest and most heart tear piec of choreographi that macmillan ha made in it he push danc to serv feel that onli on choreograph antoni tudor had shown befor the big differ between tudor and me is that he alwai sought to conceal emot while i want to get it all out in movement tudor s heroin agonis desper insid and try not to reveal their suffer it is veri english you mustn t show emot and i think my ballet embarrass peopl becaus i let emot out my childhood wa veri emotion upset my emot were store awai and the idea of releas them of find wai of explor other peopl s emot came out in my work i chose a strang medium in which to reveal feel but sinc i didn t have a good academ educ i couldn t becom a writer when i saw look back in anger it wa a great ey open and an influenc becaus john osborn had found a wai to express hi emot and hi frustrat thi wa import to me emot could be releas and though it took a longer time for me to achiev thi in danc the languag is more intract i suppos it gave me a vital inspir wa there implicit in all thi a conflict with an establish i think my entir career ha been a fight against the establish and it view of ballet i feel that i had a lot of troubl with the opera hous establish becaus of an almost pre war view there of what ballet wa about a prime exampl came in 1965 when covent garden would not allow macmillan to stage mahler s song of the earth it wa macmillan s friend john cranko who offer him the chanc to mount the ballet in stuttgart and when it wa recognis as an import work the royal ballet duli acquir it macmillan ha not made concess audienc have had to accept hi view of thing but even so my ballet can still offend the public vallei of shadow which show a concentr camp did not get mani perform it cut across peopl s strong receiv idea about what danc should do audienc ar upset not alwai by the subject matter but by the wai i treat it and yet thei would not be offend if such matter were shown by a modern compani it is like try to preach to peopl who can onli believ in what thei think ballet should be prejudic is hard to break down when macmillan stage hi full length ballet about isadora duncan earth mother of modern danc it wa as if he had lost patienc with an ultra tradit view of ballet and had broken the mirror on the danc studio wall that reflect the dancer sweat and self obsess bodi so as to show the world of theatr outsid i don t think that i conscious set out to do that but when i look back it doe seem as if i were impati with ballet percept had to be broaden isadora wa a veri theatric piec in that i us thing the audienc didn t expect speech the split of the role of isadora between a dancer and an actress if you work in the theatr you have to be a magician and as well as illumin your subject you have to excit and mystifi and make the audienc wonder nowadai macmillan s big scale ballet ar stapl of the repertori ha the fighter against the crust and the reactionari becom a grand old man it s strang but latterli i have felt that i am more accept by the public of cours there s a danger in the immens popular of the three act ballet increasingli audienc want to see full length work and turn awai from tripl bill the curiou thing is that onli here in britain and in russia is there that tradit of extend creativ of choreograph make even long ballet i m a product of that system and i love make big work sinc my ill a heart attack three year ago i find it difficult to maintain my stamina to creat a full even ballet though i still believ in them about ballet make he is frank a creativ artist is driven by hi gift now that i am marri and have a grown up daughter thing ar differ but as a young man i never thought of anyth except the ballet i wa creat or the next ballet i had to do the tension wa horribl yet i had to get it out of my system each time now work in an opera hous with a larg compani i have to produc big work that will keep the compani danc but there ar moment when i feel i need to make a small scale piec which is difficult within the context of the opera hous although i d thought about make a ballet from three sister i wasn t awar when i made the origin pa de deux for darcei bussel and irek mukhamedov of what i had creat when i saw it i realis that thi wa the farewel between masha and vershinin from three sister and i had to go on and make winter dream the subconsci is strang in my ballet make as i watch on section of winter dream i found myself becom nervou becaus i did not understand if what i had creat wa right i wa surpris by what i saw the subconsci take over and it is never realli satisfi it act as a censor and i becom my own critic about the form of what i am make it is veri mysteri i also realis now that i am no better and no wors than the music i us thi mai sound patronis to my compos but it is true my regret with my last full length ballet the princ of the pagoda is that the britten estat would not sanction ani cut with sensit edit and the truste ought to realis that i would not desecr a major score i could have made a tauter ballet but i have to do what i have to do and i hope the public will like it if i ever stop to consid what peopl want or what i thought thei d like i d never do a thing

mechan or in paint the shift from impression through cezann to cubism nobodi in my opinion know anyth about how that s done mayb it s never go to be answer it could be that it s essenti magic but johnson laird think he ha an answer to the controversi about whether there ar univers rule for reason or whether the criteria for ration ar local to cultur in their own place and time take an african tribe that believ in witchcraft on view is that these peopl ar make mistak in think anoth is that you have to investig what their criteria ar and then you discov thei ar not i think the answer is that there is inde a univers core of what it mean to be ration but there is not a set of work principl so we do actual make error in reason why did you come to america johnson laird appli a psycholog test

gaelic speaker and a european satellit channel to show nativ europrogramm you mai be abl to creat job by mean of tax incent i said but what els can a minist of cultur do higgin yelp i think that s a pathet view of a minist of cultur how can you minist for cultur it s a contradict in term well that is onli a middl class riddl now i agre that what i am do is controversi i am not sai for exampl that everyon is a picasso but i am sai that everyon ha creativ that is social negoti and if i defin what on earth doe social negoti mean ye i can put it simpli if i lift my hand am i threaten you or give you a gestur of affect you reli on the symbol that is involv we exchang symbol but what a pathet collaps it wa to suggest that onli peopl who had come from a certain school background stand in front of a pictur had access to the appropri symbol to make a liter comment that kind of nonsens wa anti democrat destroi gener cultur and if you read raymond william the literari critic you will see that it exclud even in britain the wonder storytel tradit and whatev the minist wa work himself into a rhetor rage but hi mention of storytel wa an open there is a caricatur of the irishman i said and it is probabl an irish invent which see everi man in a pub as an oscar wild in wait all you have to do is write down what he s sai and you have literatur wa thi what he meant by develop the cultur space if so it sound utopian higgin s exasper wa not feign now to whom doe it sound utopian we can t have the convers if you ask question to which you ve alreadi given answer utopian to whom you make statement in the question that you put let me put it the other wai to you do you want to continu with tradit econom view and just everi now and again throw up your hand quasi polit and sai isn t it a piti about unemploy or ar you go to sai mayb it is the econom model that ha defect higgin refus to accept that ireland or europ must eventu lose the media market battl to us televis and film maker but he is not a cultur protectionist he insist he will retali by encourag irish talent to put rival product into the market in the same spirit he see it as a proper govern function to try and save the irish languag against vastli superior market forc in thi case english the market is an instrument that can be us for polici purpos but the market becam an ideolog we do not live by the market alon what i m sai is you take the differ compon of the societi includ the cultur space and you draw from that and make it rich so that when you come to the marketplac you re neither frighten by it nor ar you disabl from us it as a tool what is realli import is the qualiti of the total space that s the area i will go into when i finish it sound like some post modernist version of paradis if you lost offic would you becom a consult no i d probabl go back to write i miss write veri veri much you re not a businessman manqu no though i know how to do it i see so mani miss opportun i believ it is onli narrow think and bureaucraci that is stop us do wonder thing the minist wa restor to good humour as i left the ministri of cultur past a peat and bone sculptur hang on the lobbi wall i thought if

he said my interest in the subject come out of compos and more particularli have taught music composit for sever year and realiz with how obsess student ar with origin but gilmor doesn t blame hi student alon the public also tend to admir origin and i think that admir is misplac and is part of the same tendenc to vener a few masterpiec and definit perform he said it s an issu blown wai out of proport we ve all becom enamor with such term as the cut edg but the emphasi is all misplac particularli with respect to a young compos it can realli stifl creativ gilmor 51 ha taught composit music theori and conduct at uci sinc 1982 last year he also wa act dean of the school of fine art he wa rear in the san fernando vallei did undergradu and graduat work at ucla and receiv hi doctor in

write tend to be veri practic in their orient but thing chang with the heaven storm compos of the romant 19th centuri the 19th centuri develop the concept of artist as hero gilmor said and to clarifi the term borrow from the write of mytholog expert joseph campbel s descript of the mythic hero the mythic hero ha to journei to hade or past the pillar of medusa slai the dragon of the statu quo to achiev rebirth from the 19th centuri on we tend to look at the artist that wai like mani an academ gilmor proce by defin term we think we probabl have some common understand when we sai a work is origin he said but if we start to pin the word down we reveal paradox and incongru we think we know what we re talk about but we don t the more we talk about it the more confus it is arriv final at the understand that it is realli an irrelev notion gilmor plan to plai part of three work commonli refer to as origin and ask what it is about them that caus us to sai thei ar origin work the work includ stravinski s le sacr du printemp debussi s prelud a l apr midi d un faun and charl iv three place in new england in my process of defin the work which we call origin ar those which reveal new

pot wherea to a kid it can be a helmet or a drum or all sort of thing but gilmor wonder whether it is even possibl to be origin ani more given the fact that everi possibl sound ha been made he plan to draw on excerpt from the work of minimalist compos john adam nixon in china to show that what is consid origin and new mai mere be idea whose time have come the point i want to make with adam is the ironi that just as with represent paint which we filter through our experi of decad of non represent paint these veri familiar sound by adam had thei been written in 1940 we wouldn t have paid ani attent to them now thei sound fresh here again it s a paradox of origin in hi own teach gilmor advis hi student to follow stravinski s descript of compos as an act of specul volit i urg my student to specul what would happen if i do thi to work more out of their head and on paper rather than to realiz on paper sound that thei have imagin i think the compos need to be much more attun to the process of composit rather than to the product what result result if it s origin fine if not is it good is it interest gilmor see hi approach as take pressur off the student that wa the origin purpos of the talk he said we all valu innov and fresh but if there were less obsess with the masterpiec and the origin masterpiec we would have more of a comprehens view of the art and a more practic concept of creat the art that is not howev a process that end with train in a composit class or at a univers he caution if someon graduat from here with a ph d in composit i hope thei would not think thei ar a

csikszentmihalyi wonder how creativ peopl behav when thei were alon he also want to know what thei thought about when thei were in the throe of creation were thei happi sad worri relax csikszentmihalyi had an idea he would ask research subject to carri beeper which could be activ randomli throughout the dai subject would stop and jot down what thei were do right then and how thei felt about it the data would be fed into a comput and analyz csikszentmihalyi s idea not onli work in the 1970s when he began to us it the method caught on with other research in a decad thousand of subject artist compos dancer chess player mountain climber basketbal player ordinari peopl had given research detail snapshot of their activ and mood the univers of chicago research document what philosoph had long suspect that creativ peopl simpli do not alwai do thing the wai other peopl do nor do thei think about what thei ar do in the same wai peopl perform at their peak seem to enter anoth world csikszentmihalyi explain recent time is distort a sens of happi and well be overcom them thei have enter what he call a state of flow when thing seem to go just right when you feel aliv and fulli attent to what you ar do athlet talk about enter of the zone when a basketbal player make on shot after anoth from seemingli imposs angl or distanc batter will see a basebal glide toward them look as big as a beach ball thei know thei cannot miss and thei don t creativ peopl such as profession athlet or gift musician ar not the onli on to experi thi state but what make them differ is that thei get these high from their work and with inordin frequenc what about the peopl who have the potenti to be creativ but ar not csikszentmihalyi want to know more about them too thi time he chose as hi subject high school student who were highli gift in mathemat all these student were equal talent but in the opinion of their teacher half of them no longer show ani real interest in mathemat we want to know why why should on group virtual abandon the subject while anoth group would take advanc cours compet in tournament be involv in math club csikszentmihalyi ask when you look at all the data and analyz it in the end what you find is that the commit student like spend time alon thei like solitud and in their solitud thei find the time to pursu their passion csikszentmihalyi said in contrast he said most peopl cannot put up with solitud for veri long after a few minut and certainli after a few hour thei start to feel a kind of psychic entropi thei ar unabl to coordin their thought and feel and action in orderli wai to keep from feel unhappi or bore thei pick up a telephon or turn on the televis charl l fefferman a professor at princeton univers who is consid on of

flourish in it we re onli begin to have some of those answer but clearli it ha someth to do with their home and their famili said csikszentmihalyi who is now write a book on the subject if the famili environ is support but expect children to do well and to work hard that clearli help if there is too much turmoil or if the famili ar too complac that will clearli affect the abil to focu and concentr what some research suspect and hope is that exposur to product solitud will make talent young peopl crave more just like addict who want drug or athlet who seek runner high truli creativ peopl those who ar both talent and product have had an extraordinari experi on thei veri much want to repeat again and again i think csikszentmihalyi said the desir to captur thi euphoria is the root of all artist pursuit whatev els can be said about creativ on thing is now clear it take more than raw talent or devot to an idea to be genuin creativ csikszentmihalyi said to have creativ requir a societi
