of islam jehad is fulli back and encourag by it patron in chief with a new cowboi bill clinton in white hous the proxi war threaten to take the shape of an atom holocaust of india unless the secularist offer the whole of kashmir on a platter to propiti the islam moloch it is anoth matter that the peopl of india ar still quit capabl of face the multipl threat obvious and no govern even offer to surrend kashmir unless bent on hara kiri but then you can bank on secularist to devis new foxi wai of cover up surrend under grandios term like autonomi and self administr as the secular opinion maker and writer mount a surreptiti pro paki and pro american campaign for time solut of kashmir problem to avoid disintegr of india although such a solut would hasten disintegr so we ar told by kuldip nayar in hi column in the statesman decemb 29 1993 fortun there is a sea chang in indian opinion whether it is becaus of unend milit or the grow feel that forc is no solut to peopl s alien the climat in india is in favour of make concess provid it doe not mean the secess of the vallei there is also the realis that the countri cannot progress without peac in the contin quotat mark as publish the so call opinion maker ar obvious happi that the secular gang have successfulli alien the kashmiri and now urg de facto azadi for them after expuls of all hindu thei ar all for creat a new islam nation so why not cut the head to get rid of the chronic headach thi remind on of urdu poet ghalib s oft quot vers ab to ghabra ke yeh kehtai hai ke mar jayen ge mar ke bhi chain na paya to kidhar jayen ge that is in a fit of life s frustrat we yearn to seek escap in death but where shall we go if even death doe not bring the covet peac so what if even a constitut regress in kashmir from the quasi independ statu of articl 370 to semi independ statu of nehru abdullah agreement of 1952 or three subject access of octob 1947 doe not prove to be the final solut what if the crusad continu the battl for full islam independ and access to pakistan of which there should be no doubt if on rememb what even nehru had said that kashmir is onli a symptom of pakistan s religi diseas and it will find some other pretext to badger india if it get it on a platter even kuldip nayar ha report in hi book distant neighbour that hate india is the veri basic creed of pakistan and superior of islam and hatr of hindu as kafir the veri sheet anchor of it exist howev just now the stand of the worshipp of terrorist forc and opinion maker like nayar that climat in india is favour for make concess becaus of unend milit is no differ from bhutto govern s at the recent indo pakistan talk in islamabad that india should swallow the bitter pill of secess of kashmir becaus of chang ground realiti chang by the pakistan direct proxi war of cours the onli differ between two stand is that while pakistan want to amput the leg the indian secularist would like to keep it dangl to the indian bodi after break it mani would howev call it head hunt if you rememb that kashmir is alwai project as the head of bharat mata meanwhil the progress of arm twist to leg twist to head hunt by pakistan and it american godfath form a great success stori of nehruvian secular which though a total fail remedi is be administ with ever bigger dose to the sick nation there is much song and danc meanwhil that china ha chang it stand of all out support to pakistan on kashmir issu wherea fact is china is against onli the third option of independ statu of kashmir as it would becom an american base against it otherwis

plebiscit and self determin even in uno howev the real solut of the problem still li in the hand of india onli if it shed the secular blinker there will be no respit to it unless it learn to look grim realiti in the face the back of secessionist milit ha to be broken swiftli and ruthlessli even as pakistan did in baluchistan even by bomb of rebel area but the piti is that the centr goe about

is a clear signal to pakistan that it would destroi itself if it insist on annex kashmir for kashmir fixat is bound to spell the destruct of pakistan whatev the price india ha to pai for it nuclear toi a dire signal is also need for kashmiri politician to agre to full integr by abrog of articl 370 or face imposit of union territori statu for the vallei and merger of the rest of the state to punjab and himach in ani case milit in the state is kept aliv as much by pakistan as by the pamper crypto pakistani of the vallei thi phonei secular need to be unmask and secession punish instead of be reward with massiv bribe in ani case peopl of india will never accept what kuldip nayar dub as public opinion but is realli the offici opinion india ha to stop behav as a poorman s wife who is the
