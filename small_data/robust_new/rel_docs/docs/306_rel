haven t you come and said at least the anc came out and said and admit that some of those sdu ar out of control mandela no you must put the matter in proper context we have had the courag and honesti to sai to the public that we have problem with sdu but you must understand that the sdu ar a commun base organ to protect the mass of the peopl after the govern ha fail to do it duti and after the peopl have lost their belong thei have come out in order to provid some measur of protect to the commun bishop i think that s gener known but it s been suggest that now you should instruct if that s the word some of your veri senior men perhap in umkhonto we sizw spear of the nation anc militari wing who have high profil to go in there and sort it out mandela we have been there sort thing out last tuesdai we had that 10 hour meet with the sdu in that area involv not onli the anc but the south african communist parti cosatu congress of south african trade union the mass democrat movement and i ask you what ha the govern done to address the question of violenc bishop befor we move awai from thi violenc the heidelberg massacr the continu attack on civilian the ever rise crime rate again i ask what can we do text mandela we ar against ani form of terror and what ha happen recent in connect with the tavern attack is a matter that is go to be discuss by the transit execut council tec we ar against ani form of thuggeri and we have condemn it publicli in the strongest term bishop the tec now ha some muscl if i can us that paus i mean it is an establish organ and you ve been address the question of violenc i think we ar talk about a nation peacekeep forc we ar talk about an integr sap sadf south african polic south african defens forc umkhonto we sizw and other group how far off ar we from that becaus it strike me mandela interrupt befor i deal with that let me just tell you about the report which wa made by the commission of polic from natal a report which ha been tabl befor the tec in that report he mention that befor the festiv season he drew the attent of the govern to the instabl in natal and felt that becaus the migrant were go back to natal thi might creat problem and aggrav the whole question of violenc he also got a legal opinion from senior council which show that the south african polic can go into natal and into the homeland without ani restrict thei ar free to do so bishop legal mandela legal and he also went further and identifi area where the ifp inkatha freedom parti and the kwazulu polic were respons for thi violenc and he mention that there wa a self defens unit in on area which wa alleg also to be involv in violenc but he wa honest and he said that there wa no concret evid to support thi alleg now that is a statement from a commission of polic in natal and you must therefor look at the whole question of the sdu from the point of view that we ar face an extraordinari situat where the govern is work with crimin in order to destabil the peopl in that region bishop let s leav that now but stai in that region and ask you when ar you and chief minist mangosuthu buthelezi go to fix thing up mandela well i have met chief buthelezi on three differ occas i have done everyth in my power to persuad him to come back and negoti with us but it is a fals premis to think that thi violenc can be address by two peopl meet in no govern in a countri anywher in the world will a govern refrain from take step to maintain law and order and reli on two individu you don t find that anywher it is the task of the govern to ensur that violenc is stop and that the slaughter of innoc peopl is immedi address by the govern and settl bishop do you still sai that you will go ahead with the elect regardless of whether the freedom allianc is on board mandela we will persuad the freedom allianc to join in negoti and to take part in the elect bishop can you do that mandela i am discuss with the ultra right i have met gener viljoen dr ferdi hartzenberg mr dri bruwer and i am discuss the whole question of the violenc their demand for a separ volkstaat nation state and their particip in the elect i do so becaus it is absolut necessari for all section of our popul for all nation group to speak with on voic on the major nation issu face the countri bishop just seven minut left i have so much to ask you mr mandela let s talk about the possibl that your parti will probabl might whatev the express is win the elect let s make the presumpt that you do what kind of a south africa as far as the economi will we have you have done awai with the idea of nation but we hear a lot of talk about redistribut of wealth a wealth tax and so forth so what can be expect in that area mandela we ar not concern with label our primari object is to address the social econom problem face our peopl the question of unemploy which is 50 percent of the econom activ popul of the countri lack of hous lack of educ and medic facil and that is our object that must be done by ensur that the resourc of the countri ar equal avail to all south african irrespect of color or creed and that is what we intend do bishop but that requir monei doesn t it and some economist ar sai it requir free market style gener monei no more talk of a marxist lenin command economi comment mandela we have never talk about a marxist economi as the african nation congress the peopl who sai that we were onc commit to a marxist economi ar either sai so becaus of ignor or out of malic our concern is not to adopt ani pattern from ani other countri it is to address the real problem face our countri and these ar the problem i have refer to we ar alreadi as a polit organ far advanc in see organ like the intern monetari fund with whose presid i met in septemb thi year as heard we have met the world bank on sever occas to discuss the question of resourc to be abl to address thi problem i have met presid like mr bill clinton prime minist major presid mitterand and all of them i m discuss question among other of resourc so that we can address the problem i have refer to bishop what ar the assur you ar give these top peopl about the economi ar you sai don t worri invest in profit out no problem mandela we ar brief them on the step that we have taken to attract invest i have point out to them that in mai 1992 we issu an invest guid in which we guarante all investor against the confisc of their properti secondli that thei will be entitl to repatri their profit and dividend and that if an investor sold hi busi activ in the countri he will be entitl to repatri them bishop sorri i ve got to rush everyth up so much to ask quickli the question of freedom of express and in particular the control of the sabc south african broadcast corpor it s been said in certain quarter that the anc now control the sabc that the nation parti control it befor now it s the anc doe it control the sabc mandela i don t think so thi is a board that wa set up by an independ select panel compos of south african of the highest integr thei ar not member of the anc and thei could not set up a board which is compos of member of the anc bishop but thei ar point to three promin and highli profession peopl who ar close connect to the anc and who ve just join the sabc comment mandela well i think that as far as i m awar if you ar talk about the three person that i know thei have been select becaus of their merit not becaus of associ with ani polit organ bishop to cut it short you wouldn t chang thought let s sai you were the leader of the countri in three or four month you wouldn t lift the phone and tell new editor and other peopl what to do mandela the democrat cultur is veri much entrench in the african nation congress we believ in an independ media becaus we would like to look at the media as a mirror to see how we ar function and to control the media would be contrari to the fundament principl of democraci and it is for that that we have attack the nation parti s control of the sabc bishop move to anoth matter veri quickli in the time left the afrikan what is wrong if a group of afrikan sincer want to move awai and live on their own mandela we ar against ethnic solut bishop why mandela we have fought the bantustan system and we have now overthrown that system even the nationalist govern which wa the onli govern which recogn the bantustan ha now agre and a claus ha been entrench in our constitut that all the bantustan all the homeland self govern and independ must now be reincorpor into south africa if we made an except and gave in to the demand of the afrikan for a volkstaat nation state we would be reopen the same thing all the bantustan would put forward similar claim and you will break up south africa into a number of differ polit entiti which would destroi our economi bishop just a few second left what kind of messag would you send now at thi point in our histori mandela we would like the spirit of reconcili to be accept by all south african bishop not reveng mandela no we have made the point veri clearli that we ar not here for retribut we ar here to try and contribut to the build of a new south africa bishop mr

we all assembl and pass the night togeth as guest of the bophuthatswana defens forc and offic the follow morn as a result of the interfer of the politician who as mr mangop correctli point out had an entir differ agenda and did not want to stabil bophuthatswana but want to destabil it so that presid mangop s govern could be overthrown so that he could be compel to take part in the elect or so that he could be replac by anoth govern which would take part in the elect the awb onc again gave heed to the wish of the militari author in bophuthatswana du plessi interrupt but you also shot a few of them dead terreblanch that we should withdraw at that stage not a shot had been fire the awb wa inform that thei we should withdraw and what did we do we withdrew from the oper area on the instruct of the bophuthatswana polic and colonel breytenbach who almost certainli wa speak on behalf of the bdf we withdrew in vulner vehicl open pick up truck head for the border without our weapon du plessi interrupt but fire as you went terreblanch interrupt wait wait du plessi interrupt were you not terreblanch interrupt you were not there let me tell you du plessi interrupt but is it not true that your men were fire as thei went terreblanch of cours it is not true the awb withdrew but i would like to ask you now in all fair if we ar to conduct a sensibl discuss pleas do not interrupt me again realli don t the awb reach a certain point and that wa a bridg the first vehicl had alreadi cross over and the second vehicl the command vehicl in which my gener were travel an ordinari pickup peopl arm with handgun hunt rifl and other weapon not oper weapon right at the bridg the veri same defens forc which wa suppos to defend us suddenli start fire on our move vehicl with 40 mm mortar and that is it the awb took cover and fire back the fight start and thei took their injur took them out includ colonel bouwer and the other six injur men who ar now in the hospit these injur peopl were put in the open pick up and fire as thei went and as you said reach the border the casualti figur as you said reach 50 dead on the side of the bophuthatswana peopl includ 10 civilian which i sincer regret i believ thei were caught in the crossfir no on will accept respons as to whose bullet hit them but more than 280 peopl accord to the sabc south african broadcast corpor were injur our movement wa place in a posit where we had to defend ourselv battersbi interrupt but where wa your victori then your shine victori terreblanch wait a moment wait battersbi interrupt i want to ask you about the shine victori that you refer to todai at the press confer in ventersdorp in fact it is the direct opposit of what the overwhelm major of south african and foreign believ i want you to tell us how it is possibl that you can speak of an overwhelm victori and a miracl when in the first place your men were thrown out by the avf peopl second your peopl your soldier were shot at by the secur forc of a govern which in your own word had invit you into the countri third it wa clear that you stood no chanc against the unit forc of the sadf south african defens forc how can that be a victori i cannot understand it terreblanch i want you to understand it veri clearli so that you will not remain in the dark for so long it is a shine victori when peopl ar sent into an oper area with handgun thei were fire upon from casspir armor vehicl and other armor vehicl thei were fire upon in open pick up and even ordinari sedan thei stop the assault of the mortar and the casspir by fire back effect thei move up to the border and the outcom of the attack wa just that the total number of casualti on the side of the awb five were kill while on the other side 50 were kill and 285 were paus now i want to sai to you the reason why du preez interrupt were thei the enemi terreblanch but of cours what do you call the peopl who ar fire on you with mortar du preez but thei were the legitim defens forc and you see them as the enemi terreblanch look everyon know that the defens forc and the polic had turn against the bophuthatswana govern thei mutini that is why presid mangop is where he is todai and your enemi becom your enemi within a second that is what we found out there those who were suppos to be our friend the communist inspir element within the defens forc let me sai straight out that wa the dilemma mani of the bdf member welcom the awb in the most friendli manner the betray which wa commit wa so shock precis becaus it came from the same forc which had receiv us in such a friendli manner the desert in mr mangop s defens forc and the polic desert paus gener turner told us that night that 90 percent of hi policemen had desert the next morn the whole bophuthatswana polic forc desert so the awb drew the fire of the polic and defens forc desert who were us artilleri and armor vehicl against it small arm fire and you sai you find it difficult to see it as a victori had the awb not been abl to stop the armor vehicl in their retreat it would have meant hundr of dead in the awb but that did not happen battersbi i understand that but i want to ask again how can it be a shine victori when you yourself withdrew from the scene know full well as you said todai that gen viljoen had betrai you sever time how could you terreblanch interrupt it remain a victori for us becaus we pull out as we had been ask to do by the bdf we follow the instruct of the head of state whom we recogn as the head of state we did not know that at that stage he wa no longer head of state if the head of state and hi forc sai we must withdraw and we do it and we withdraw honor and we ar attack dure our withdraw and we fight our wai out and we fight to gain safeti and we fight and we win can you still sai you can t understand how that can be a victori i am a veteran i serv a long time in rhodesia for year i serv on the south west african border i know battl under those circumst the most difficult battl is when you ar withdraw when you ar in fact fire over your shoulder and if you ar drawn into an ambush four or five time and you emerg from the presenc of death and you bring your peopl home and your casualti figur is so small that in our group onli three men fell with two more later when gen viljoen sent out some men in all that great convoi onli three men fell and you tell me that is not a success battersbi but i want to ask you onc again how can that be a victori when you left your own injur peopl behind du plessi interrupt and the presid you had gone to defend wa no longer presid battersbi how can that be a victori mr terreblanch terreblanch look those ar two question there ar two of you ask question so pleas listen patient to my repli the two repli du preez could you keep it short our time is limit terreblanch look i want to answer you the wai you ought to be answer du preez mr rowan cronj is on the telephon he would like to respond to some of the thing you have said terreblanch he s welcom i first wish to sai i see it as a shine victori for peopl who had to withdraw under fire and onli left three bodi behind while the attack who had laid the ambush suffer a loss of more than 50 dead and more than 280 injur and bear in mind that we pick up our injur except for the three whom we had not seen in the convoi inde we had to search for their bodi where thei had fallen i can assur you had thei been left behind by the awb i would have institut an investig du preez i think you will have to here we have a report by a senior avf man tim do you have it du plessi ye an avf man said i could hear clearli over the radio how he wa order hi men not to turn back for the injur thei would not stand a chanc against the bdf soldier terreblanch let me first ask you who is the person who said that du plessi it wa a senior member of the avf who wa involv in the terreblanch interrupt i ask what hi name wa my name if eugen terreblanch you ar tim who is the person who made thi so call alleg why is he not here on agenda tonight i do not react to ghost basson i would also like to enter thi discuss max du preez pleas ye i have been neglect you a littl basson i would like us to look at the other side of thi issu and i would like to hear mr terreblanch s comment on the role plai by the sadf in the whole matter we ar face with an absolut textbook type communist takeov where chao and anarchi is first be creat du preez interrupt is that a statement or is that a question to mr terreblanch basson it is a question to mr terreblanch du preez mr terreblanch terreblanch i would realli like to answer the question but let him tell me what he want from me give him the opportun du preez we just have a few minut left pleas i would rather like to hear from you now that the question ha been pose basson in other word we would like to know what role paus now that the revolut ha been complet after the awb and the volksfront have withdrawn the south african defens forc came into the pictur for the first time and if on look at a document distribut by joe slovo in which he also predict what the situat will be like in south africa he said quotat in english

FBIS4-1066: bfn interview with ifp central committe member ben nguban anc offici mac maharaj and iec commission ben van der ross by announc john bishop in the johannesburg studio live text bishop a veri good even to you first the big new of the dai the inkatha freedom parti ifp will take part in next week s histor elect that moment agreement wa reach earlier todai at the meet between the ifp chief mangosuthu buthelezi nation parti s fw de klerk and the anc nelson mandela thank you all veri much gentlemen for come start with you dr nguban just briefli the talk that you back down last week the intern mediat went home and here you ar in thi situat how did it happen nguban well fortun the negoti continu after the mediat had left for their countri professor okumu of kenya carri on negoti between dr mangosuthu buthelezi and dr mandela and presid de klerk and sooner or later consensu emerg as to the wai forward bishop ye mr maharaj how ar you read thi now thi question wa put in our new bulletin victori or defeat for whom maharaj i think it s an unqualifi victori for the peopl of our countri all our peopl black and white across the board i think south africa todai wa abl to breath a sigh of relief at the breakthrough that wa made through thi agreement i do not think we should look at the matter from the point of view of winner and loser polit comment will talk about strategi fail strategi and bad strategi the import thing is that south africa now is face with an elect which is realli inclus it ha been achiev in injuri time but still a try score in injuri time is a try bishop i ve heard that somewher befor pik botha said it that s right let s move to you mr van der ross the meat and potato the bread and butter question eighteen million ballot now to have ifp ad to them how ar you go to do it van der ross well with a lot of elbow greas of cours the whole logist of be abl to provid at thi veri late stage for an effect accommod of a new player is truli go to be veri problemat and veri difficult but we have mobil immedi a sort of an a team into the field thei ar alreadi in kwazulu work with our local team there we ve got a back up team back in the head offic work right at thi moment on develop strategi for all the differ element of the elect on the basi of the work we have done todai alreadi it doe look as if it s possibl to put it togeth bishop now stick physic ifp at the bottom of the form that will probabl rais some legal question there van der ross no the act and the regul will be chang to accommod all of the necessari there ar a number of issu that will need to be chang but obvious with the cooper of all the parti thi is go to be possibl bishop mr maharaj the amend that have to be made now what do thei look like maharaj the amend ar be draft sinc thi afternoon thei will be put to the negoti council tomorrow the amend to the constitut ar fairli straight forward thei simpli ar an amend to two claus on a constitut principl and the other on is section 160 which provid that in the case of provinci constitut and specif in the case of kwazulu natal there shall be provis for the zulu monarch bishop dr nguban now what ha happen what is the situat with king zwelithini and the zulu nation and how ar you read that nguban well the king wa worri when it becam clear that a feder dispens will not be achiev in thi countri so self determin for hi peopl for hi kingdom wa go to be total wipe off the polit process so he demand that the sovereignti of the zulu kingdom should be restor and the kingdom itself recogn we work hard at negoti thi posit and now it is go to be enshrin both in the nation constitut and it will be made mandatori for the provinci constitut of kwazulu natal to enshrin that as well bishop nevertheless it remain as part of the greater whole doesn t it nguban certainli it s part of a greater south africa but allow for the differ commun to achiev what we can call a fair measur of self determin bishop what do you sai mr maharaj maharaj i do not think that the provis speak in ani wai about sovereignti what the provis sai is that the constitut of natal shall provid a place for the zulu monarch that will be left to the legislatur and it will be left to the mediat process to resolv precis in what form and to what extent the matter is dealt with but i think that nonetheless it is import that the provis ha led to similar space be made in other provinc where there mai be a monarch bishop now back to you dr nguban now the zulu support the support inde not just zulu of the ifp ar thei go to get the messag quickli that you ar on board now nguban well we ve been veri much prime for elect all along we have an elect campaign which ha been work incessantli we never oppos elect as a matter of just oppos it we want to have a dispens that we could live with that could have mean to the live of our peopl and that ha been achiev and we ar readi to go bishop but when you sai readi to go i mean onli a week ago you were sai no go and i suppos that messag got through all over the place where there ar ifp support now you will have to sai go go go nguban well our peopl ar highli motiv highli politic and thei will respond accordingli maharaj i do think that the public have been face with confus signal come from the inkatha freedom parti and perhap i would ascrib that to poor tactic and strategi becaus it is veri import that while politician ar seen to be peopl who make glib promis it is veri import as peopl who have fought for freedom that our promis should be real and should be consist and i believ that that s a crucial element in win voter support bishop dr nguban would you comment there nguban well i mean mac is skirt the whole ball game here he wa on of the peopl who made it imposs for us to be part of the process from the word go by the intransig that thei adopt in the negoti process thank god that sens ha prevail at last so we have never promis anyth that wa not attain what we want wa a feder dispens for thi countri which the negoti process wa quit capabl of address but it wa stop from do so bishop alright let s move on now if we mai to violenc the whole countri i suppos is scream out let s stop it stop it stop it what step ar both parti the anc and the ifp take like realli to go and stop thi now nguban well the agreement state veri clearli that it is an agreement for reconcili and peac in south africa and all the signatori commit themselv pledg themselv to work for peac and free elect so it is go to have to be a truli combin effort no on parti can do it on it own bishop the mass action now inkatha youth ar thei go to march or not nguban well the caus for mass action is remov as far as we ar concern bishop will the messag get through nguban well it is get through right now becaus there wa no mass action yesterdai todai and tomorrow so the messag is get through bishop anoth question for you at the moment dr nguban maharaj interrupt i think that on the question of violenc the countri ha certainli gone past the point where the threat of violenc to the elector process which wa perceiv at on time as a veri seriou and formid threat ha now been reduc in my estim by about 75 percent from what it wa two month ago the event which brought bophuthatswana fulli the peopl of bophuthatswana into the elector process the break up of the white right as well as the come in of the ifp have reduc that potenti for violenc immens and i believ that if we work at it with a will all parti we can certainli shortli after the elect through nation uniti establish peac in our countri bishop right on more for you befor i move on a littl bit dr nguban the imbizo meet gather of zulu call by hi majesti the king will it go ahead nguban well i don t know yet but hi majesti ha call the imbizo to mark a sad moment in our histori where we were be strip of our ident and our possess and so on now i don t know whether that precis condit still exist or not maharaj my understand of the matter is slightli differ we did consult hi majesti in the cours of the negoti and he indic that the press report were not within hi knowledg that he would be look into the matter and certainli he ha issu a statement now call upon hi subject to particip in the elect so i believ that now sinc it wa call accord to press report for the 26th 27th 28th that matter will no longer intrud on the elector process and the elect will go on bishop well let s stai with king zwelithini dr nguban what is hi statu now nguban well he is recogn as the constitut monarch in term of our present kwazulu constitut he ha a function in the legisl assembl he is the head of the whole indigen law system he is the head of the amakhosi chief and he occupi a posit of uniti in term of our nation bishop and the obviou next on chief buthelezi what s hi posit nguban well he is the tradit prime minist to the king but he is also the elect head of govern of kwazulu bishop there ha been a new rumor let s put it no more than that for the last coupl of week that chief buthelezi wa offer even a deputi presid a cabinet posit even if the ifp did not score well at the poll true or fals nguban no i have not heard of such an offer i think dr buthelezi is a democrat he will work hard to lead out parti to victori so that thei will be no offer but he will get what is hi due in term of the constitut provis bishop mr maharaj maharaj certainli no such offer ha been made from our side what we have consist said is and in promot the idea of a govern of nation uniti is that on the basi of the elector result we will do everyth to accord all the parti a proper place in that govern we believ that the next five year central requir a trust of nation uniti we ar come from a conflict ridden hate ridden societi and we have an immens job of reconstruct so we made no such offer except to sai that each parti believ it is import ha immens elector support the elect will test that and on the basi of that test each will be accord a proper place in that govern of nation uniti bishop that mean what maharaj it mean if ani parti win five percent of seat in the nation assembl it qualifi for on seat in the cabinet and in proport to the higher percentag of number of seat it ha in the assembl it will get the requisit seat in the cabinet so that if a parti won 60 percent of the seat it will have 60 percent of the cabinet bishop mr van der ross i know you ar not go to engag obvious in the polit discours but there ar some more question for you veri quickli on concern the safeti of your monitor and their abil to get to place how confid ar you that thi can happen i don t think in particular in natal kwazulu of cours van der ross well we ar certainli look to the kwazulu author to provid both the messag and the cover for the climat for our peopl to be abl to move freeli through the territori if we ar to set up machineri we need to within a veri short space of time a few dai if we ar to move in with massiv voter educ program which we ar plan we can onli do that with complet cooper from the author but we ar pretti certain that it is obvious in the interest of inkatha and through that possibl the kwazulu legisl assembl to give that kind of assist and i am sure we will get it bishop thei will dr nguban thei ll get thi support nguban thei certainli will we ve alwai pledg support for the iec bishop what s the situat about the state of emerg or partial state of emerg the nation peacekeep forc coupl of question there in on what s go to be the attitud now nguban we have not realli address that issu we do accept that it s anachronist to sai you re go to have free and fair elect while you have a state of emerg we have state that posit but nevertheless we need to maintain the highest level of law and order and peac dure the elect process bishop there might be loos canon there outsid your control nguban that s what forc of law and order ar there for that is a job realli for the secur forc bishop and the nation peacekeep forc is it go to be recogn as for what it ha been set up there to maintain peac as a nation forc nguban we ve had problem with the constitut of the nation peacekeep forc becaus it s taken in what i would call parti polit peopl and pretend to turn them into a nation peacekeep forc which will be abov prejudic and imparti we doubt that peopl who have been train as polit guerrilla forc can perform such a function maharaj let me sai thi about the state of emerg it wa impos becaus of the violenc and the loss of life if that continu i believ that thi agreement will contribut substanti to reduc that violenc but the violenc is total unaccept yesterdai the death of a lead photograph ken oosterbroek threw south africa into a shock ani more death ar unaccept so the state of emerg ha been motiv by that need and at present while the agreement hold promis the realiti is that the violenc is ravag that provinc and we need to maintain it in such a wai that free polit activ can take place activ bishop thank you veri much just a remind that of cours we ve been talk to mac maharaj dr ben nguban mr van der ross and we did approach the nation parti

everyth it could to encourag all the side to get organ in that countri in rwanda whatev side thei mai belong to and we thought that sinc we had instig the arusha summit and the agreement which wa sign in 1993 we had plai our part we also thought that the replac by an intern forc of two french unit which were in rwanda wa to prevent what ha happen late therefor i believ that these ar groundless accus and i rememb in particular a letter sent to the presid on 1 septemb last year by the rpf presid who express hi most sincer thank for the role plai by franc in these negoti the role of an observ ledu mr minist the rpf doe not want to know anyth about french soldier in rwanda it doe not even want to know anyth about french weapon which mai be us by un troop there ar inde accus level at franc

actual no longer topic what is topic is the fact that the belliger have stop at last that there mai be a ceas fire that we mai final be abl to look after these peopl thi is the true issu the motiv of the rpf or other movement is a problem for the rwandan to look into franc is not involv in that french polici ha alwai been the follow see to it that thi african issu be dealt with by african we have

first and foremost take thi crisi in hand we have also obtain the agreement of the senegales and the guinean who will interven with us and then of a few european too few ala i think that you will see

level of the secur council to that end the secur council had adopt a resolut resolut 918 which broaden the unamir mandat we cannot see why franc should rush in now so we still oppos thi for the reason we have alwai given name that franc wa in rwanda in 1990 allegedli to protect foreign and french citizen but afterward we saw that franc began to support the exist govern and it took three year for franc to leav rwanda now franc is return to rwanda for it is said a humanitarian action well we think there ar reason other than humanitarian on poivr d arvor you think that the real reason is for pari to try to maintain the current regim at ani price bihozagara why not becaus franc ha never shown us anyth differ so the regim that is carri out massacr todai ha been aid support and arm by franc now we believ that the current french action is precis to continu it aid to the regim that is retreat in disarrai poivr d arvor francoi leotard you have face you the repres of a ethnic group that you want to save and he is not in agreement leotard there is no such intent i would like to sai thi with all due respect to mr bihozagara he met mr jupp thi morn i think the talk were frank we explain what our aim were i repeat the instruct that have been given to the french forc is for them never to come into contact with the rpf which mr bihozagara repres in other word thei ar not to try at ani time to becom involv in thi conflict i do not see how we can be reproach for save peopl who if i have understood thing properli ar tutsi in the first place the peopl in cyangugu whom we want to protect i realli do not see how anyon can doubt our good faith in thi matter becaus there ar no other intent i am tell mr bihozagara thi veri forcefulli and with a great deal of convict experi will prove it i hope he will wait for the next few dai we will remain in contact with the rpf in fact we intend to remain in contact in order to inform them daili regularli hour by hour of our intent of our posit to show clearli that never at no time do we have ani belliger intent in thi matter never poivr d arvor mr bihozagara you ar tutsi in the minor there do you nevertheless think that all possibl form of help must be given to avoid the genocid that is now go on first can you confirm the preliminari figur that have been given the german foreign minist ha spoken of 500 000 dead ar we on that scale of valu if i can put it like that second what can be done to stop thi genocid if there is no foreign intervent bihozagara you know let me repeat that it is wrong to sai that franc is go to help the tutsi or save the tutsi thi is becaus in thi conflict in thi genocid it is not onli the tutsi who ar the target but everyon who doe not speak the same languag as the regim that franc support for reason that i repeat we cannot understand so now franc want to return to rwanda allegedli to save the tutsi you know veri well howev that rwanda ha in fact lost more than 500 000 peopl out of the 500 000 peopl i would sai that 95 percent ar of cours of tutsi origin two third of the tutsi popul insid the countri ha been wipe out while the hutu intellectu elit of the moder opposit ha been 80 percent wipe out now i think that if franc were to return there that first it is too late and second we think that the french intervent is more like to complic the situat and to set the whole region on fire poivr d arvor mr leotard would you like to comment sinc we were talk just now about the african marshal mobutu wa not a favorit in western capit here he is give you a help hand with hi airport leotard we ask zair to allow the plane to land at zairean airport so that wa a normal contact between on govern and anoth in order to us our land platform thi is complet normal if you will rememb i repeat that our aim and i recal the strong feel you quit rightli arous on your network our aim is to save human live i do not see how it can be that a week ago all the nongovernment organ and you quit rightli and a lot of intern observ told us what ar you wait for you must go in now that we have embark on the process peopl ar sai why ar you go in i repeat it is not we who ar go in it is not the french govern it is the unit nation which is ask the french govern to undertak thi humanitarian action while wait for a larger forc of more than 5 000 men in fact to come in un uniform to protect the peopl we were not oblig to do it that is quit true but we ar do it i can assur you that it is a difficult and burdensom oper that inde is not without risk we ar do it i think becaus we have a specif concept of our intern respons of franc s role with it african friend becaus franc doe have a role to plai of cours with our african friend these friend includ rwandan of whatev ethnic group there you ar it is as simpl as that i am sorri that peopl ar forget todai from what i hear that there wa a resolut by the un secur council a few moment ago poivr d arvor right so i will add that franc is call

the rpf rebel have alreadi said that thei ar not in the least interest in whether all the tutsi thu their own peopl ar massacr in the countri s interior it is a matter of total indiffer to the patriot

complic civil war is take place in your countri but you still claim that your govern s armi is disciplin and doe not kill that is veri difficult to believ bicamumpaka of cours the armi kill but it kill the aggressor the rebel ar attack the soldier that mean that member of the rwandan armi ar mere defend themselv just like in war our armi s soldier ar kill their enemi but our govern s militari do not attack provinc and commun in order to murder civilian there that is shown for exampl by the fact that our govern ha conven assembl in mani commun in order to halt the massacr we have succeed in
