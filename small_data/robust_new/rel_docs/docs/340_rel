defens technolog foundat and yasuo imai yi execut director defens technolog foundat text ty there seem to be a trend take place worldwid due to the end of the cold war for countri to cut back on militari spend a review of japan s mid term defens budget would seem to suggest that the end of the cold war ha also had a major impact on the defens industri in japan such as can be seen in the reduct of attack weapon recent two roundtabl forum each head up by the chief of the bureau of equip were form to discuss defens arm purchas and defens industri technolog the two group will be exchang view on the futur of the defens industri and defens technolog with knowledg peopl from both insid and outsid the defens agenc i realli feel that the time in form these two group could not have come at a better time in that context i wonder if we could begin our discuss by look at what the real advantag ar in do r d and develop our own technolog in japan with that in mind i would like to begin by ask mr uehara to give us hi view on the futur trend in technolog particularli as it pertain to defens relat technolog would you first start by give us an overview of the technic research and develop institut trdi it organiz structur staf averag ag level of educ and number of exchang student from japan and elsewher and so forth su as far as our current organiz structur is concern there is a gener affair depart that handl overal administr of the entir divis a plan depart that handl r d plan and technic survei and a technic research depart in addit to these there ar four other develop depart that have been establish as implement structur for ground sea air and guid weapon there ar a total of five research institut the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th research institut that overse element research and also two branch offic on in iioka and the other in kawasaki the trdi also ha five test lab which ar locat in sapporo shimokita tsuchiura niijima and gifu and ar us to test and evalu new technolog the staff is divid accord to whether thei ar technic administr or self defens forc personnel r d relat personnel includ 564 research specialist and anoth 242 kei self defens forc peopl r d support personnel total 1 185 that number includ 52 peopl work in either self defens or administr post and 327 peopl in manag so that mean that 70 75 of the personnel work at headquart consist of r d personnel when we look at the individu r d depart we find that more than half the staff ar assign to on of either two depart name telecommun 34 or machineri 24 the remaind ar emploi in either the aeronaut 11 physic 9 chemistri 5 or marin 5 depart pie chart show current staf by r d field as of 1 june thi year the averag ag of an administr employe wa 40 04 and that of a research specialist wa 41 06 that figur ha been gradual decreas over the past few year as the institut ha sought to hire younger employe in term of academ qualif exclud self defens forc offic there ar 93 peopl who hold doctor degre and anoth 227 peopl with master s degre in term of the staff take part in exchang program from insid japan and elsewher there ar at the present time six foreign here do doctor work and anoth two who ar part of an organiz exchang program with 14 peopl pursu doctor degre and anoth 10 seek master s degre there ha also been a notic increas in the number of peopl from within japan who ar take part in exchang program ty next let s shift our attent to budget matter includ r d expens payrol and gener overhead of the facil i know thi will be an import issu in the futur so i would like to ask what your plan ar for recruit recent colleg graduat and train these peopl su befor we talk about that let s look at the number of research paper that have been publish outsid the institut there were 90 paper publish in 1989 113 in 1990 107 in 1991 118 in 1992 that figur ha averag more than 100 paper a year it is somewhat less than the figur for nation research institut which averag about 134 7 paper a year but i do feel we have done pretti well ty i ve heard that certain academ group ar refus to publish paper from the trdi so i would like to ask you which academ group ar publish your research paper su well first of all there is the aeronaut group and the telecommun group and recent more and more paper ar be publish by foreign academ group thi ha result in the registr of industri properti right includ both patent and util model there were 152 applic file in 1989 and 68 of these were regist in 1992 89 out of 97 applic were regist it seem at the time as if almost everi applic would be regist i think that the futur look rather bright when view from thi perspect now in term of the trdi budget the budget ha been grow at an annual rate of 10 20 it went from 92 1 billion in 1989 to 136 0 billion in 1993 the greatest part of that increas wa r d expens which climb from 82 8 billion in 1989 to 123 8 billion in 1993 overhead expens also rose from 1 8 billion in 1989 to 3 0 billion in 1993 i think that thi strongli suggest how much more emphasi ha been place on the trdi than on other militari facil in term of hire the trdi hire onli 13 peopl in 1989 22 in 1990 17 in 1991 23 in 1992 and 23 in 1993 the trdi ha been hire at the rate of more than 20 new peopl each year main test and research equip at trdi missil simul precis guidanc simul flight simul torpedo simul dome launch rang explos proof rocket fire test equip fix ground site for test armor vehicl high speed shock equip electron war game simul aerodynam propuls research facil and electron test facil attempt to internation institut ty doe the same rule still appli about maintain minimum hire su it doe but the staff increas sinc 1992 have been greater than the staff reduct and in fact have shown a slight upward tendenc and we ar try to figur out the best wai to train these new staff member on of the problem is manag train thi is becaus as soon as thei ar hire thei ar subject to npa nation personnel author train intern bureau train and trdi train in the case of trdi train a new employe must first undergo four dai of train by the npa then a month of initi train for i type employe and thi is follow by 2 1 2 month of trdi train the trdi is also be internation so a month of train wa ad last year to help develop english convers skill thi is a privat run english convers school in which new employe enrol we have alreadi start to see some good result from thi program ty i think that s a good idea and we should try and see if we can do a better job in advertis that fact su we also train our administr staff somewher between the 6th and 8th year after come to work for the defens agenc supervisor level employe must take part in a three week train program sponsor by the npa and somewher between the 12th and 15th year lab director and assist manag must take part in two week of research and train also i type employe at the trdi with 8 10 year of servic must go through a three month manag train program in addit to these we ar also offer gener cours and special train at the nation institut for defens studi for those seek master s or doctor degre we ar also send peopl to the nation defens academi for postgradu studi in scienc and technolog and to the nation defens medic colleg for postgradu studi in medicin as well as send peopl to corpor for train in the case of staff be sent to corpor we usual send young engin when we ar about to launch a new project in order to have them studi design and so forth as far as oversea studi there ar ag restrict under 30 year of ag and candid have to be screen the trdi also ha a program in which it send employe with phd who ar 45 year or younger for train at oversea research institut these employe ar more independ so thei can write their paper while discuss relev issu with research in oversea countri the benefit of thi ar that the paper that ar publish in japan receiv recognit and induc from oversea univers ty i think that present an accur pictur but there ar some organiz problem in thi area as well there ar a lot of case where research with phd cannot get their paper publish no matter how hard thei try su recent though we have been see more and more paper be publish oversea i think that thi bode well for the futur there is also the chanc that we will hear noth from these oversea univers it ar you talk about regular univers or militari institut su i m mainli talk about regular univers in the unit state we have noth go on with militari institut there will be some joint research in the futur howev so we mai eventu do someth with those institut as well yi there ar some peopl from the trdi who ar take part in some program at an institut in canada call the nation research council aren t there i believ that the canadian govern ha provid the institut with monei to attract top research from around the world to come and do post doctor research i have also heard of a similar type scholarship program in europ i believ that have younger peopl from the trdi take part in intern program such as these will go a long wai to make the trdi more intern it it wasn t that long ago that we were think about invit foreign research to the trdi for on year of research but that project never got off the ground becaus it cost so much monei su i think that the cost of take care of these research while in japan is too expens and we need to look at better wai of do thi ty i heard about on case involv a foreign research who wa part of an exchang program at the nation defens academi the nda look at the idea of put thi person up in a guest hous but thi wa too expens so thei us a privat apart instead and made it a short term intens cours it i think it would be nice if the defens technolog foundat could absorb some of those expens by the wai what do you think li ahead for the trdi in light of the end of the cold war the break up of the soviet union the persian gulf war and the trend in asia su the effect that the end of the cold war had is obviou i think the persian gulf war taught us the follow 1 the import of continu to ensur and maintain high qualiti of defens relat hardwar and equip that is maintain technolog superior 2 the import of build and regularli us a c sup 3 i system that is abl to organ integr and deploi sensor inform and variou type of weapon 3 the import of have land air and sea transport capabl that enabl larg quantiti of troop and equip to be transport quickli to place in japan in time of emerg and if possibl organ thi accord to geograph region we ar also pai special attent to asian countri especi as it pertain to the remov of us militari forc increas in nation defens spend start with china and north korea and the progress thei ar make in modern arm i think on of the area where we ought to be pai special attent to is in start to emphas r d for maintain technolog superior even in the face of militari reduct by advanc european countri and the unit state on the other hand we ar look to join up with intern technic associ in order to compens for the cutback in nation defens spend and still meet our r d goal i think that thi would enabl us to share the risk and cost marshal our technolog and strengthen the bond with those organ under those circumst japan must adopt polici that ar base and essenti preserv the us japan secur treati it must try to do more in the wai of provid host nation support conduct joint train exercis between the unit state and japan and bolster the allianc through technic cooper includ joint r d look at the polici adopt in the current mid term defens plan of the trdi we can see the effect that thi line of think ha had in the section entitl outlin of defens spend regard main weapon in which it talk about innov and modern equip base mainli on achiev stipul level and seek to further beef up behind the scene area such as technic r d and also in anoth place in which it mention perfect advanc elementari technolog therefor i think we must gener keep the follow thing in mind when plan r d 1 that our highest prioriti in addit to be in charg of r d for the sdf is take r d request made by militari oper 2 that we must make improv and refin so that we can modern exist militari equip to keep up with the advanc made in technolog and the chang in the militari environ 3 that r d on advanc elementari technolog be done with foresight base on advanc in technolog it what ar the main r d item that the trdi will be engag in the futur su in the area of aviat we re work on the prototyp 4th of an fs x next gener support fighter thi is the largest prototyp that we have built so far and we expect to be abl to do a maiden flight by 1995 next we re work on a prototyp 1st of a new miniatur observ helicopt as a successor to the oh 6d it will be us by either anti tank helicopt unit or divis fly unit to do reconnaiss work issu warn or aerial command and control and will be the first helicopt develop by the trdi anoth project involv the research and prototyp 2nd of a combust wind tunnel the tunnel is be built in higashi chitos and will be us to test the ramjet engin us for guid missil and to test duct rocket the tunnel will enabl us to ascertain the high veloc aerodynam properti of item such as the base bleed shell while be fire insid the tunnel then we ar engag in the research and prototyp 1st of a devic to test engin perform at high altitud yi when do you think each of these project will be complet su i think in perhap seven or eight year but when we take into account all the facil that have to be built it will probabl take more time than that next in guid weapon relat research we ar prototyp 3rd a new guid fighter missil the convent infrar guid missil system us in the sidewind and aam 3 track their target by point but thi new guid missil system will be the first to us an imag base guidanc system to track it target these thing ar incompar faster than the older antitank missil and short sam missil in other word both we and the enemi ar both move so the ccd signal process present realli seriou problem it look like we will be quit hard press in develop these technolog in firearm and militari vehicl matter we ar work on a new fuse for us in mortar we cannot get a releas on the vt fuse technolog from great britain under which the new mortar shell is licens so we ll have to develop thi item on our own the next item involv the research and prototyp 1st of a ground base robot which is us for land mine process thi is a robot that can skillfulli get around differ type of obstacl the us and other countri have been work exclus on vehicl type robot but the trdi ha been work on it own to develop a robot that can perform danger job thi research ha also gotten a lot of support from variou corpor it do you mean thi robot will have the capabl to detect land mine su the research on land mine detect is be done separ we ar look into wai in which land mine can be detect by either infrar radiat milliwav or differ type of radio wave it is thi part of the joint research work between the unit state and japan that the trdi ha been involv in su no it isn t the robot favor by the unit state ar either self pilot or auto load type robot so i do not know whether the unit state ha ani interest in japanes robot technolog or not it mai be that thei feel that thei do not want ani of japan s good technolog or thei mai feel that their own technolog is superior now in warship and underwat weapon relat matter we ar engag in the research and prototyp 3rd of the main element configur a futur naval escort in the area of electron equip we ar involv in research on sonar for surfac ship anoth interest item we ar work on is a self propel target that oper on water the target is hoist off a ship by helicopt and lower into the ocean after be lower into the water it run accord to a preset program and becom a target for bomb or machin gun from air self defens forc aircraft the target can be recov and reus and is program so that it can be scuttl thi project is schedul to be readi by 1993 japanes defens technolog thin in mani area ty by the wai mr uehara you mention earlier about the level of japanes technolog in us japan joint research i would like to hear your view about how japanes defens technolog stack up against both european and the us defens technolog su we ar talk here about a varieti of differ technic area but taken as a whole i think that us defens technolog could be equat to a dens popul forest european defens technolog to a regular forest and japanes defens technolog to a spars popul forest i think the area where japan is further ahead is in civilian technolog such as semiconductor composit materi superconductor and ceram the defens relat technolog in these area ar quit advanc and ar in no wai less superior than those in europ or the unit state when we look at each area more close howev we see in aircraft for exampl that japan is at about the same level as europ and the unit state as far as fast subson aircraft go but japan is no match when it come to superson aircraft i think that the fs x that japan is develop will more than hold it own against the european efa next gener european fighter or ruffl on of the problem howev is that japan lack the technolog to develop and manufactur the engin for these type of plane and will more than like never reach the level of the f 22 next gener fighter us by the us air forc it didn t that us to be the advanc technolog fighter call the atf su that s right i think that thi is the top of the line as far as high perform aircraft the thing that stand out most about thi plane is it stealth characterist the gener us of advanc composit materi throughout the airfram aerodynam and across the board system such as avion there is no such system like that in japan that combin all these technolog there is no question that we have outstand advanc technolog therefor i believ that we must creat as mani opportun as we can to develop and nurtur our technic strength the problem is we run into cost problem the chanc to develop defens technolog in japan ha been quit limit due to small product quantiti japan is at a distinct disadvantag to europ and the unit state in thi area i think that cost will becom a more and more import issu in the develop of differ kind of aircraft in the futur in the area of missil i think that japan is on an equal foot with europ and the unit state in term of element technolog in fact when it come to propel and sensor japan ha the better technolog in term of perform japan is probabl equal to or ahead of europ and the unit state when it come to antitank missil antiship missil short rang air to air missil aam and short rang surfac to air missil sam for exampl we cannot compar in the area of medium rang aam or medium rang sam becaus we have no experi develop these but i think that japan would compar quit favor if it were to vigor appli the technolog it ha develop and the experi gain from develop prototyp for defens purpos japan doesn t know much about surviv howev when it come to coordin the oper of numer missil as we see by look back at the rowland vs short rang sam debat that caus such a stir in the diet there is still onli a thin understand of the concept of surviv we could probabl attribut thi to a lack of actual war experi thi is an area where we ar go to have to get feedback from the troop in the field as we conduct militari exercis emploi missil system we feel it is import that we gain as much experi as we can in thi area the recent report on the problem of intercept anti ballist missil ar true in that japan ha no capabl in thi area whatsoev therefor i think that it is import that we begin do some type of research in thi area it is thi someth japan is realli go to get involv in su i think that japan will develop thi on it own independ of gpal in the event that the unit state ask japan to do thi with gpal i think thei will request that japan take on area in which it ha expertis but when thei sai that we realli do not have anyth at thi point to sai back in defens of that it well if that s the case do you think that thei will come back again and request that we take part in gpal su that is a possibl if that should happen it would most like be a polit matter that would have to be address as a whole not by us but rather by the defens agenc and the ministri of foreign affair even if we should actual get the go ahead japan still lack the technic capabl to take thi on if it becom necessari i think that we will have to develop it in the futur in specif term the vt tube of the missil is report to be no good in other word it is ineffect unless the warhead split up with a direct hit which is to sai that becaus the warhead is big that even if part of the airfram is destroi the warhead will still be aliv and come in and explod and will have the veri same effect for that reason i believ that japan must have the technolog for accur hit the warhead ty with westpac western pacif missil defens plan and gpal limit anti ballist missil defens system thi is someth that privat industri is involv with on their own and that mean that the defens agenc ha noth to do with it su the trdi must be readi to act so that it can handl situat when technolog becom necessari as technolog next in the warship relat area i think that japan is about at the same level in term of shipbuild howev it is behind when it come to stealth technolog and the technolog for minim wave disturb in the construct of ship not much ha been said about the stealth warship that the unit state recent made public the technolog for both design and build an integr combat command system or aegi system ar still not develop but we have start research on a combat direct system and thing ar proceed smoothli as far as an aegi warship we ar now work on the technolog for thi by us the technolog introduc with fm in term of weapon system we ar still import ciwss and short rang sam from abroad but i think we ar get readi to replac these with our own technolog in underwat weapon relat technolog i think that if the grx 4 torpedo we re develop is success that thi torpedo will be as good as ani in the world for thi type of weapon we ar also get good report on new idea in sonar technolog at the nation institut for defens studi research for exampl ar look into a neurochip circuit that can accur distinguish the sound of on target from that of anoth japanes technolog ar superior to that of europ and the unit state when it come to electron equip radar comput and optic fiber if we were to appli these technolog to defens hardwar japan would immedi be abl to catch up with the rest of the world exampl of thi includ the fc in tank the home devic in missil and aircraft avion armor vehicl technolog is now at the same level as that found in europ and the unit state japan is now first in the world when it come to hydraul pneumat span equip auto load equip and especi the technolog for fire while underwai in which fc station ar control in an integr manner on area where japan lag behind the west is in ammunit europ is wai ahead of japan in thi area thi is becaus the amount of monei invest in thi field at the trdi ha been extrem small r d outlai for ammunit though have slowli start increas over the past few year as far as test and evalu facil we just finish work on a dome fire rang and soft recoveri system and also built a facil at the tsuchiura research institut for observ high speed impact between variou phenomena and continu to build more research and test facil we had no choic but to bring the 155mm base bleed shell to the unit state to have it test much to our surpris the technic peopl there seem to be taken aback by the wai in which we collect data on the projectil thi wa becaus we had the data transmit by radio wave from the fire shell and the mach number and drag coeffici were displai instantli in real time under the high impact and high speed condit i think that we ar a good deal ahead of the west in these kind of technolog when peopl hear stori such as that howev thei often take it to mean that we ar much further ahead in ammunit technolog but the truth of the matter is that these ar just blip on the screen and we still have a lot of catch up to do ty i think that on of the reason why japan ha gotten off to such a slow start in thi area ha to do with the fact that there ar no modern facil in japan where we can conduct test that meet the minim standard for test ammunit anoth reason for the slow start mai be due to the fact that we did not creat a solid foundat in our initi research with simul at the lab and thi kept our research from move to the next stage i would realli like to make sure that thi problem never happen again ammunit technolog is a littl bit differ from other advanc technolog as far as the relat with manufactur goe in other word sinc there ar no dual us for ammunit compani ar not abl to invest in thi ahead of time and ar forc to reli on govern as a backup r d on kei basic technolog su now with respect to develop defens technolog in japan i basic feel that there will be no chang in the current polici of the trdi be the main parti respons for r d on sdf militari hardwar militari equip also becom outdat so the trdi is alwai think about wai to modern and improv militari hardwar in other word the trdi will no longer develop thing in the wai that it alwai ha that is base on unilater request from the militari oper but will move toward a system in which it develop futur gener of hardwar that will not have to be upgrad or improv for 10 or 20 year there will be technic advanc made dure that time and these will be incorpor as we go along for that reason i think that the trdi must come up with new idea for appli the result from r d on basic technolog that look into the futur of militari hardwar base on request from militari oper ty in my earlier year we would have the troop in the field test weapon that we had develop we would then get feedback on how well the weapon perform and thi inform would then be us for make improv or develop new model we would then consult with the technic engin from militari oper or exchang commun with them but thi practic did not last veri long what happen wa that when a problem from the field wa relai to higher level it would tend to get stuck at that higher level su well if someth like that is occur the trdi should show some willing to get involv we have been work on that system ty take aircraft for exampl we never have a formal version of an airplan there ar alwai new system be develop to make improv even as the equip is be us we will make a modif if we run into a problem or find new compon that emploi new technolog to have a formal version of an aircraft is import be an ag where rapid progress is be made in technolog if we try to adopt too mani new technolog we delai upgrad to equip and fall behind other countri ty you ar get to ecp engin chang propos aren t you su you mention it earlier but we have to increas our research on basic technolog in the futur anoth area where we need to focu our attent is internation the institut it goe without sai that we will have to expand the present level of joint r d between the unit state and japan moreov we have been get a lot of request from differ peopl in european and asean countri who want to come see the trdi and ar ask us if there aren t area where we could work jointli in develop technolog the problem with thi is that there ar alreadi certain establish channel between the unit state and japan regard technolog and japan is actual prevent from work jointli with countri other than the unit state in weapon technolog relat work by the three point polici govern weapon export therefor i think we have to look more deepli into thi in order to see if there is some wai where technic cooper could be possibl ty in the 21st centuri asean countri will form on of the most import polit and econom block in the world so we must not forget about them next what do you think about the privat sector role of the trdi su i do not think we will see much chang in the privat sector role plai by the trdi that mean the trdi intend to keep borrow on the knowledg and experi of the privat sector that enabl it to do r d on advanc technolog in comparison it would be almost unthink for thi to be done under civilian leadership if privat industri come up with someth new and interest i think that we can have it present to the govern and the govern then turn it into an r d project the trdi lack the design and manufactur technolog to handl those type of thing so it ha to reli on privat industri across the board it is veri difficult for privat compani to maintain larg expens test facil so i think that the govern should be the on to maintain such facil and let them be us by privat corpor ty what do you think the trdi role should be with regard to basic research su with respect to basic research we should quickli seiz on ani idea that the academ commun mai have but i do not feel that thi is the type of work that the trdi should be get involv with i think that thi is someth that should be left to univers and that we have to consid basic technolog in the context of long term research and how it is appli to militari hardwar some exampl of thi includ the conform antenna the ir ccd liquid propel robot technolog and neurochip applic in signal process basic technolog mai provid the best rout for develop applic for advanc technolog such as these prototyp plu it there ha been a lot of talk recent about r d not predic on equip what ar your thought about do r d without it be predic on equip su thi express ha caus a lot of misunderstand these word were spoken a lot dure a recent roundtabl discuss on defens industri technolog and realli caus a great deal of misunderstand if we think about thi in term of real problem when we start do research on futur fighter plane and futur guid missil that research did not have a direct link to hardwar but the research wa conduct anyhow becaus it wa believ that down the road that it would be help in make later develop possibl thi is still go on right now we feel that by do thi we reduc the technic risk in develop new item in the futur if we receiv a propos to take part in joint r d it give us some bargain power to sai that we have such and such a thing or we can develop such and such a thing in order to do thi we ar talk first about make prototyp of aircraft naval vessel armor vehicl and other hardwar so that we can test the technolog in some case thi mai mean prepar on fire unit on squadron if we re talk about aircraft ty in the case of the ground self defens forc ar you talk about someth on a scale us in non commiss offic school su thi is just my opinion but we should go ahead and do someth at that level and equip the unit in the field with it and conduct field test i think we can us the feedback from that if necessari to put the item into product the chanc to develop item from scratch ha been diminish in that regard i think that we will be ok if we can maintain the technolog for that make it possibl for the field unit to becom awar of thi again and evalu it and come up with develop configur it we ll have to make some modif in the r d direct then won t we yi well technolog is go to keep improv so even if the militari side know what system it want a decis cannot be made without data therefor i think at the demonstr model stage that we will have to make a certain number of unit it you re refer to prototyp plu aren t you yi make a lot of prototyp give us a lot more leewai in respond to differ demand until recent most peopl thought prototyp wa a sort of trial manufactur befor an item went into product it thi is becaus manufactur believ that thei cannot do r d without it be predic on a specif item i think what thei were concern about is amort their r d cost but there ar other wai of look at thi besid that in other word by revis the system and do thing the wai that mr uemura recommend earlier it would not be that much differ from do r d not predic on specif equip we also have to consid what the offic of technic assess ota in the unit state ha been sai about the era of produc larg amount of militari hardwar come to an end and countri have to start think about wai to cultiv their most import core technolog in the case of japan the approach ha alwai been to receiv a request from militari headquart and then develop demonstr and test that piec of equip i think that we have to be abl to sai even when the request come from militari oper that we re not go to put an item into mass product but we re go to cut off product as soon as the test is done i think that we have to consid do it that wai or anoth wai in which the test and report of militari hardwar propos by the trdi is test and report on by militari oper ty when it come to how the unit state pai our understand is that thei make full payment at each stage it no i don t think that is true the unit state ha been sai the same thing thei us to pai for mass product but thei sai that on of the problem thei have now is that thei can no longer do thi ty advanc countri have settlement method base on weapon export but that is not possibl for japan so it is tougher su the thing that is interest about the unit state for exampl is that despit have decid on an initi number of b 1b to manufactur thei were suddenli abl to cut that number midwai through product the problem with that type of system howev is that monei is be paid to maintain product facil what i mean is even when thei put privat industri on hold thei still come up with the necessari monei so if the need ever aris thei can immedi increas the quantiti in the system that type of think is complet alien in japan in japan whenev the pitch of product is drop there ar no polici about what to do with the product equip thi is a caus of great concern it even the unit state ha said that it will have to revis part of it system in order to adopt the prototyp plu approach i don t know in what area thi will happen but it will involv some new regul in that sens i feel that we should come to some type of conclus in thi discuss regard what approach japan should take in revis it system yi the us is studi wai of us limit budget but if thing proce with the militari take the initi base on convent spin off it benefit privat industri becaus it improv their technolog but now thi philosophi is be somewhat modifi the idea now seem to be dual us that is to includ spin on as well if thing go in the direct of spin on i think that it will lead to privat industri look ahead to the futur the govern provid the fund and the equip and research in the past the intens competit between compani in the japanes electron industri creat a high technolog level in that industri and even threaten the technolog superior of the unit state but now the unit state is move in the direct of do all it can to support industri and thi mai forc japan onc again into an era in which it will have to weather intens competit the unit state is move toward a nation polici of encourag independ r d ir d and is try to provid fund to compani for r d if it can be us for futur defens purpos thi is similar to the subsidi system us by miti ministri of intern trade and industri here in japan the depart of defens is reportedli take part in thi project we have no such system in the defens area in japan and it would be veri hard for japanes compani to adopt such a system becaus of their independ su i think if we ar go to try and attract talent from privat industri that we will have to come up with wai to rais the level of monei budget for department and intern research while at the same time increas the r d budget of the trdi now about incent the trdi start a special research program in 1992 on of the purpos of the program is research on futur defens hardwar the program budget between 20 and 30 million a year on develop promis new technolog last year there were eight project and thi year an addit five ha been ad we have seen an all out effort by younger research in thi project who have set themselv veri ambiti goal even at a cost of failur ty when mr moriya wa the head of the technic research divis we attempt a special research program that wa later call the proposit research program doe thi special research program have the same goal as that su it includ both project that the trdi is work on independ and project that involv corpor as far as independ research it is amaz how mani uniqu idea we ar receiv on variou type of research it is hard to tell at thi point whether we can immedi build incent into thi research or not there ha to be an environ in which the germ can grow i think that we should design the system so that we can combin the talent of compani in the privat industri too it ar you talk about contract with individu compani su it would have to be base mainli on trdi engin work independ so the research would onli be partial support by corpor fs x train trdi prospect it there wa some mention in the newspap and magazin but could you mind sai someth about the current statu of the fs x and someth about the first intern joint develop exercis would you also sai someth about the five joint us japan joint research project su as far as the statu of the fs x is concern we were run about two year behind our origin schedul but ar do fine now late last year we move the fighter line from gener dynam gd to lockhe lfwc we were worri about what effect thi would have on the timelin but the chairman tellep promis us there would be no delai the fy93 prototyp budget which ha a contractu base of 96 5 billion is the largest it ha ever been we ar make steadi progress toward develop the first plane by 1995 the lesson here in term of how to apport demand specif equip cost and risk is to adjust for the differ in wai of think idea and wai of process technolog transfer develop agreement etc uniqu to each countri govern privat corpor thi took much longer than we thought it would it wa a realli difficult problem to resolv at the administr level in the area of joint research propos project we re do research on promis technolog that ar not directli link to equip these includ the follow six research project 1 duct rocket engin 2 advanc steel technolog 3 ceram engin for armor vehicl 4 milliwav infrar complex seeker 5 close loop demagnet technolog for steel ship 6 ey safe laser we ar also look into whether we can do joint research at the practic busi level jwg if an agreement can be reach concern the alloc of research item schedul expens it will constitut an item for joint research if an agreement can be reach a sow scope of work is set up if we can come to term on how the agreement for joint research will move forward we will conclud an mou follow by implement of the research i would like to tell you where we ar at with regard to each of the research project mention abov in the duct rocket engin research project we conclud an mou and have alreadi begun do research in the advanc steel ceram engin milliwav infrar and demagnet project we ar in the midst of studi the research find in the eyesaf laser project we ar studi the feasibl of joint research next i would like to sai someth about the basic posit of the us japan relationship in particular and how it should be handl technic cooper is on of the link for strengthen the us japan secur arrang the flow of request between the two countri ha been shift from a on side on in which most of the demand come from the unit state to on that is more two side we ar also promot technolog transfer base on r d find after thi wa debat a major prerequisit wa an agreement on which wai to proce it is especi necessari for japan to try and perfect basic technolog on it own so that it will have someth to offer when it come time to discuss joint research ty our time is run out so would you sai someth about the recent trend in the unit state toward isol itself technolog su the unit state ha first rate technolog and it is a matter of person pride to us that technolog for rescu other countri around the world i think that thi will continu in the futur defens technolog ha a nation in a certain sens the stand order of the militari is to try and maintain technolog superior over other countri in the case of joint r d with other countri the unit state want to acquir the technolog of other countri without let go of it own technolog it is not so much isol but stop the outflow of technolog an exampl of that type of think is when japan ask the unit state for a licens for mlr and did not get a repli i do not think that anyth can be done about thi therefor japan s onli wai is to quickli achiev a compar level on it own without have to import the technolog if japan is ask by the unit state to take part in joint research on a defens technolog i think that in some case that it would be determin to sai that we ve develop such and such a technolog ty that onli goe to show how import and critic it is to have bargain power when it come to technolog i want to thank you veri much

veri high level but the whole thing wa poorli plan thei were train peopl but thei weren t give ani thought to actual put them insid afghanistan thei just jump in overnight and went too fast in the wrong direct western aid offici who ask not to be identifi by name blame the impati for quick high profil result on what thei describ as princ sadruddin s ambit to becom secretari gener of the unit

close friend to head the afghan program shakil khan a retir pakistani armi major who wa appoint by sadruddin s offic to head the mine clearanc program conced that costli mistak have been made it is a veri import and well found critic khan said of the charg that train fund were wast but thi is the first time the un ha taken up thi kind of program now we have learn from mistak and we think the whole oper will improv thi year two un mine clearanc team of 27 men each ar schedul to begin work in afghanistan after tuesdai and the unit nation is negoti to bui equip that can clear larg number of mine in a short time still some critic insist that larg scale wast will continu in the reconstruct project becaus of the wai it is structur with all the major un agenc work in afghanistan under the control of sadruddin s offic which is thousand of mile awai in geneva us offici in their report last month said there is not a singl un agenc head in islamabad who think the manag approach is work nor is there ani embassi in islamabad that will speak favor of it and wors there seem to be littl or no prospect for improv us offici who have run a larg success cross border aid project in afghanistan for the past five year have paid close attent to the mine clear program becaus it is financ almost entir by the us taxpay thei were upset when sadruddin refus last month to us part of the mine clearanc monei to fund an american project that wa alreadi under wai in afghanistan us train personnel and dog that can sniff out mine sadruddin said in a letter to the us ambassador in pakistan that the american project violat the dog anim right he said mine place by human be should be remov by human be the messag circul throughout the aid commun provok a furiou respons from intern aid worker who question the princ s concern for the live of the afghan peopl be train in mine clearanc the 1 5 million program which is fund separ by the us agenc for intern develop ha problem of it own the dog ar from thailand and appar understand onli thai command thai militari instructor and interpret had to be brought in for two month last summer to train the american dog handler who then had to train afghan through other interpret iron the thai dog ar the descend of dog that the us armi took to bangkok in the earli 1970s and thai dog handler were train by american aid offici explain that the us armi discontinu it dog program after the vietnam war and that the thai dog were the onli train anim avail us offici ar negoti to bui 40 addit thai dog for us in afghanistan sure there ar some problem on aid worker conced but the dog stori is realli what the whole issu is about basic it s a success stori and basic sadruddin doesn t like it expert involv in the un project agre thei ar quietli disregard the princ s ban on us dog and not long ago thei commit 450 000 in un monei for the purchas of vehicl to carri dog into afghanistan to work with the un team there critic of the sadruddin oper is not limit to the high profil mine clearanc project abdullah ali an afghan technocrat who join a un financ reconstruct agenc in novemb said the ultim ironi is the titl of the program s director he said sadruddin s offici titl is coordin for the unit nation in afghanistan but if the program lack anyth it is coordin that s it biggest problem he said right now everyon is work unsystemat ali cite the unit nation approv last year of an afghan resist command s request for 1 million which he said would be us to clear a road that he said serv 30 villag in afghanistan s kunar provinc in realiti ali said never in histori were there even 30 peopl who live anywher near that road what the command did wa reopen a road that led to on of the few forest left near the pakistan border he cut down all the tree and made a person fortun the problem is that no on is check on anyth and the un seem to be in a big hurri to spend all the monei at sadruddin s offic in islamabad public relat director rene albreck conced that there ha been a lack of account in the program he blame it on the fact that such check is imposs in a countri still at war albreck point to sadruddin s latest offici posit paper entitl plan of action 1990 and said the kei word now is systemat there wa no systemat follow up on anyth in the past and we would like to have more account but much of the larger problem wa base on a wrong assumpt we assum that a million refuge would go home when the soviet left afghanistan last year and the point is noth happen nobodi went back so we ve been rethink everyth there can be differ type of mistak and in our case you can sai the mistak wa the miscalcul and be too optimist intern aid offici who repres score of countri that in 1988 pledg a total of 195 million for the afghan reconstruct effort insist that thei have been extrem costli mistak mayb thing will improv thi year who know a european aid offici said but when you look at program like the mine it s not just the monei on wonder just how mani limb and how mani live might have been save and might yet be save if onli the princ could get hi act togeth
