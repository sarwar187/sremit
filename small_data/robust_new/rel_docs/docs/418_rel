anywai thi exhibit make it clear that whatev it is it is more than on thing out here in california we tend to think of folk art as be made by loner eccentr outsid with no art train such as simon rodia or grandma prisbrei who just up and make privat world for themselv we think of them as neighborhood oddbal and hermit or social outcast like the black folk artist in a memor exhibit seen at the craft and folk museum or in cat and a ball on a waterfal at the oakland museum that s the kind of folk art we tend to have here in the far out west but an american sampler on view through april 30 insist there is more than on kind of american folk art it come from the shelburn museum which is situat on the shore of lake champlain in southern vermont consid the lead repositori of the genr it wa found in 1947 by electra havemey webb youngest daughter of the henri o havemey the great collector who bequeath a famou gift of impressionist and old master paint to manhattan s metropolitan museum given that proven it is not surpris that mr webb s exasper mother onc ask how can you electra you who have been brought up with rembrandt and manet live with such american trash it is also not surpris that the east coast shelburn collect present us a more civil version of folk art where the california version tend to emphas the idiosyncrat the eastern version plai to someth almost classic a brunnhild figurehead circa 1850 wa clearli made by an artist who knew about baroqu sculptur it would not look out of place in a mainstream galleri on the other hand a stark littl carv of a revolutionari soldier

visit friend in woodstock ny she came upon a box of what would becom her signatur item whenev i go somewher friend know i like to go around to see if peopl ar sell antiqu and junk she said but i m not realli an antiqu person i m a junk person anywai i wa at a flea market which is what thei call swap meet in the east when i found a box mayb 2 inch by 3 inch and insid were all these miniatur clothespin thei were made for children to plai doll with i just like them almost 10 year later after see an exhibit of found tin sculptur by toni berlant she final figur out what she would do with them i went into a drawer and saw all these clothespin and someth happen she said i start to fool around with them make littl structur the first wa a simpl boxlik design that she glu togeth out of clothespin and tape measur she later unglu it so that the structur could chang depend on how it wa held sisson now us no glue or nail in her work allow the piec to take shape more spontan as she work on them to bind the piec togeth she experi with telephon wire from a spool she found near a manhol i thought it wa just what i need sisson said i ask the worker there and she said i could take it the artist now get her wire from a supplier but she get other bind materi zipper and old tablecloth that she shred for exampl from her continu swap meet jaunt the structur she made out of the repetit of these everydai materi ar not at least on an obviou level about home life americana or nostalgia but thei do hearken back to her childhood i didn t grow up sew or make basket or anyth like that she said but from earli on i had a fascin with pattern my mom wa a buyer for bonwit teller the big depart store in new york for 25 year and sometim she would take me into work with her on saturdai i us to wander into the stock room and i can rememb that in thi enorm room i wa fascin by the rack of cloth on after anoth there wa row after row of the same dress then row after row of anoth dress and on and on i can still see the pattern the rhythm thei made in that room her experi with unorthodox materi continu while she went to graduat school in the earli 1980s at ucla where her teacher urg her to think big on time we were have a seminar in on room when from anoth came thi clang sisson said with a laugh on of my sculptur had grown beyond it limit the clothespin and everyth had come crash down after scale her sculptur down to a more manag size after graduat sisson s work divid more or less into basket like form and sculptur the basket ar the more access to viewer thei transcend languag said laurel reuter director of the north dakota museum of art reuter includ sisson s work in the frontier in fabric exhibit now tour asia it doesn t matter which countri we show her work in peopl look at them and then as soon as thei realiz what thei ar made out of thei alwai smile but the sisson basket ar not simpli novelti reuter continu i like them becaus she is us object of contain clothespin and zipper to creat contain that could not possibl be us to contain anyth but the idea of contain the flow wall and floor sculptur ar for sisson much more person work like the basket thei make us of the clothespin and other household item but thei ar less calcul and more express she believ i think thei talk about interior exterior issu she said about how the exterior might reveal or conceal someth about the interior and how there might be piec of ourselv that we don t find particularli attract inde some of the sculptur ar although abstract about specif issu and event in her life thei deal with issu that i consid more of the feminin side of me while i think of the basket as more masculin so it s no surpris the sculptur ar more person anoth import differ is that although there is littl commerci interest in the sculptur the basket sell thei ar avail for price rang from 600 to 1 200 at galleri in sever citi includ in santa fe nm where her work will be part of an upcom exhibit becaus she is not repres by a local galleri she sell her basket out of her studio i guess i feel closer to the work on the sculptur but i m grate for the basket she said thei support the art the basket have also to a certain extent type cast her year ago i wa show slide of my work to the owner of a well known galleri in northern california she said he took on look at it and said ah craft on art critic write about her sculptur complain that thei smell too much of a notion counter sometim i think to myself mayb i ll be taken more serious if i move on to anoth medium mayb i should try some cast or someth sisson said but that onli last for a few minut i us the materi i us becaus thei sai someth to me when you get right down to it it doesn t matter what my work or anyon els s work is made out of
