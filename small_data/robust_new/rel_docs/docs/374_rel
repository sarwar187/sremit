thi question on the basi that it is the duti of the leadership to put befor the public a total pictur ani leader who is mere promot the point of view of hi polit parti is not a leader who is go to

and now we go to john simpson the foreign editor of the bbc to put hi question to mr mandela simpson mr mandela i hope you ll forgiv my be frank i m think veri much of the kind of peopl who ar watch thi program in other countri than south africa mani of them ar go to see the nation parti as heard as a parti with a past that ha not alwai been veri good or veri democrat not alwai been nonviol in mani wai even within it own organ thei ar go to see that you ve made a number of veri larg elect promis which have rais the expect of peopl a great deal in thi countri and thei ar go to wonder frankli whether south africa under your presid won t be head down the same road that mani other countri in black africa have will you will you for instanc borrow monei on the scale that so mani other countri have zimbabw for instanc how will you deal with thi problem robinson mr mandela mandela south africa is not a poor countri as i have said our budget thi year is 126 billion rand we also ar go to reorgan the budget restructur the budget in order to avoid the wastag of apartheid we will be abl to us the countri s resourc in a more effici manner and to prevent the corrupt which is so endem in the np govern robinson pleas ladi and gentlemen mandela the gravi train where most of the fund of the countri had gone ha come to an end we have commit ourselv to leader try to lead a style of life similar to those of the commun we ar go paus i am go to suggest that my own salari if i am elect as state presid must be cut applaus i am do that unlik the np govern which ha paid attempt to pai larg sum to the director gener when there ar 5 million peopl unemploi when there ar 7 million peopl without hous we ar not go to live like fat cat my friend in the np can do that that s what thei know robinson mr de klerk a respons from mr de klerk de klerk mai i at the outset sai that our deficit befor borrow is much too high if we want to be in step and attract foreign invest and be sure of the support of the imf and the world bank we will have to continu in south africa to maintain strict fiscal and financi disciplin thi is what the govern ha en do by do it and by take other step we brought down the inflat rate to singl digit figur and soon it might be 7 percent we ve brought down interest rate all our econom indic ar point in the right direct i m veri glad to hear that in the govern of nation uniti i will have the support of mr mandela in be frugal with regard to govern expens but then we must be frugal across the board becaus it is at the moment organ alli to the anc who ar onc again do damag to the south african economi by strike with regard to variou disciplin and through those strike thei ar first help to creat an atmospher which is not conduc to free and fair elect and second thei ar harm the econom interest of the countri so i m glad to hear that he s commit to fiscal and financi disciplin he won t have ani difficulti with me in achiev that but if he think that he can save on the salari of politician enough to solv the econom challeng which we have in south africa then he s in for a big surpris applaus robinson thank you for your cooper mr mandela you can have a rebutt mandela obvious mr de klerk wa not listen when i wa speak i mai as well add that i m happi he is go to cooper with me if i sai a state presid should pai a tax on hi incom on hi resourc on hi purs that is what head of state do throughout the western world not in south africa we ar also go to issu govern bond reconstruct bond both in south africa and abroad to rais the fund that we need we ar go to impos a fair tax to be paid by everybodi all these ar go to help to get revenu for the countri but we ar not go to live like fat cat the dai of the gravi train ar gone everybodi should know that applaus robinson mr de klerk your final repli de klerk i wa under the impress that the anc ha promis lower tax for everybodi in it manifesto bond which you rais also carri interest with them on of the biggest problem of south africa is that the fastest grow item in our budget ha been the interest on loan everi loan that you take out need to be repaid and who repai it the taxpay therefor we need across the board to ensur that we maintain fiscal disciplin that is the econom solut for the futur i ve been listen veri carefulli to what mr mandela ha said and i m veri glad that we re go to have a govern of nation uniti becaus it is clear that our experi will be absolut essenti if we want to have good govern in south africa robinson we now move on to the next question john simpson again of the bbc foreign editor your question now to mr de klerk simpson anoth frank on if i mai in februari 1990 you assur white voter that thei would have a part to plai in the futur polit develop of the countri at the end of your negoti with the anc mr joe slovo of the anc south african communist parti came out and said i think the nat nation parti cave in at the end by 1999 perhap earlier you won t be part of the nation paus of the govern of nation uniti is it possibl do you think that white in south africa will then perform the same function that thei do in sai kenya or zimbabw that s to sai thei earn the monei earn some of the monei but thei don t have ani part to plai whatev in the polit process of the countri robinson mr de klerk de klerk the answer is a frank no i m white but i m no longer the leader of a white parti i don t repres white interest i repres a valu system and my parti ha support across the board from all popul group color paus color creed and race in south africa if my parti is not the biggest parti in thi elect it will definit be so in the next elect applaus and the white within the nation parti and mani other white also support other parti like the dp democrat parti don t look upon themselv as a littl group of peopl who ar go to sit in a corner divorc themselv of south africa and it problem and it peopl we ar part of a south african nation color in the nation parti s vocabulari ha becom unimport what is import is what do you believ in we believ in free enterpris we believ in good famili valu we believ in real peac we believ in reconcili we believ in christian norm and standard and that is bring togeth all the peopl across the old divis from all the popul group into our parti and that is give an impetu to our parti which assur that for those who believ in thi valu system which ha proven itself across the world which is in step with the success part of the world will becom the domin polit factor the anc is a conglomer it s go to rip apart becaus thei don t have a clear philosophi thei live in the past applaus robinson your repli mr mandela you have two minut mandela it is quit clear that we ar deal with somebodi who either doe not know

quantum theori produc a surreal world of hidden symmetri in which the concept of matter no longer figur thi is headi progress part of weinberg s aim in hi stimul book is to tell how it happen and what it mean he is well equip to do so in 1979 he won the nobel prize for physic and later wrote a famou popular account of the origin of the univers the first three minut but weinberg ha a second and for

is a book and here it is highli liter comprehens challeng a survei of an excit and extraordinari field of enquiri by on of it lead figur weinberg s task is to describ the current standard model of elementari particl and forc and to explain why it is now at an impass the model result from marri rel and quantum mechan which ar mutual incompat in all but a veri few interpret the standard model is the best of these few in older theori atom were conceiv as miniatur planetari system with electron orbit a nucleu the new model argu that there ar no particl as such onli bundl of energi in variou field field ar modif of space and there is on for each type of particl electron ar energi bundl or quanta in electron field photon ar quanta in electromagnet field the nuclear particl ar themselv compound of more elementari quanta quark each with their own field these phenomena ar describ by field equat and their interact the strong and weak nuclear forc the electromagnet forc and graviti ar govern by the gener principl of quantum mechan and rel thi model ha prove highli success in it predict and explanatori power but it is full of problem which theoretician have been try to understand and which ssc type experi might resolv the chief is that although the standard model offer some success in unifi the electromagnet and weak nuclear forc it doe not unifi them with the strong nuclear forc still wors it ha no wai of describ gravit in term of quantum field theori the aim of deriv a unifi theori for all natur s forc is therefor at a stand such a theori is the grail of fundament physic and would in weinberg s view constitut the final theori about physic realiti theoretician offer propos like superstr theori to overcom the standard model s difficulti but onli ssc type experi can turn such guess into progress weinberg promot the ssc as a kei toward discov the final truth about the univers thi involv him in two controversi commit first he is a realist about the standard model he believ that field theori describ the world as it realli is and therefor secondli he is a reductionist about particl physic he believ that all other scienc rest on it and with enough comput power and time can be explain by it these belief involv him in quarrel with fellow scientist unpersuad by reduction and with philosoph unpersuad by realism mani biologist count among anti reductionist thei see live organ as have emerg properti inexplic on the basi of microstructur alon emerg properti ar those which complex system have but their part lack conscious and life itself ar exampl neither

these issu ar profoundli import and not just becaus billion of research dollar turn on them weinberg is right to oppos those philosoph whose scientif illiter relativ lead them to think that scienc is mere on among mani ideolog and accord to some a sexist racist and imperialist on at that but he misunderstand positiv which he defin as the claim that scienc should avoid talk of unobserv entiti and forc positivist inde allow such talk but treat it as pure instrument in help us to construct us theori weinberg believ that on can deduc a theori s truth from it util but positivist deni thi ptolemi s

and attempt to recov the purchas power lost sinc last juli and then some the result would be a return to the dilemma between high inflat and a recessionari tighten the other possibl is that the union will realis the enorm advantag of extend the agreement these includ continu reduct in inflat the creation of more secur job for present and futur gener a sharp declin in interest payment in spite of the recent reduct italian short term interest rate ar still sever percentag point higher than those in the other european countri if the market were reassur that the benefit of the 1992 agreement would be extend to 1994 the condit ar there to take advantag of high italian return the inflow of capit a more credibl govern and therefor a reduct of the polit risk premium and the downward trend of intern interest rate should all contribut to a fall in italian rate by year end short term rate could be 5 point lower than in recent year such a reduct would have a signific effect on the budget with a debt of l1 600 trillion million million i estim that a reduct in short term interest rate by 5 point would bring about a net save of l80 trillion by the end of 1994 over the same period a further deficit reduct of l50 trillion should come from cut in public expenditur along the line pursu by the amato govern new measur to curb tax evas by the self emploi higher tax revenu as the economi continu to recov privatis proce save from the elimin of corrupt on public contract all thi would bring the govern deficit to 3 3 per cent of gdp almost in line with the maastricht requir the fall in interest rate should also contribut to an increas in invest and togeth with the improv current account to an expans in incom and employ thi is what itali would gain from the extens of the wage agreement but union leader ar bound to ask themselv what their member would lose with fix nomin wage the onli possibl loss for worker is an increas in price figur avail for the first nine month of the agreement show a loss of purchas power onli of about 1 per cent as for the futur even in the pessimist assumpt that inflat jump to 6 per cent for the rest of the year as a consequ of devalu the overal loss of purchas power would not go beyond 2 per cent thi loss could be easili compens by allow for a rise link to product increas moreov in 1994 the effect of devalu on price will have all but disappear in exchang for wage moder the union should ask the govern for institut chang which could contribut to bear down on price level on of the most urgent is the deregul of the distribut sector whose ineffici and high profit margin have kept worker from benefit fulli from product gain if the union can be persuad to make the ration choic and extend the wage agreement to the end of 1994 i challeng them to announc it right now thi would bring forward the benefit of the extens provid the govern and busi a stabl framework on which to plan the impact on job creation would be signific what about itali s return to fix pariti and the monetari union process the answer and here i come to my second prescript is ye but onli under the proper condit the question must be seen in a broader context on might think that the expans which itali is now enjoi is onli the result of the fall in the valu of the lira that is simpli a repetit of the old game of competit devalu but in fact itali is now engag in a rebellion against the bundesbank s suicid polici of high interest rate act like a david against a mighti goliath itali would most definit welcom share the fight for lower interest rate with other countri with similar problem especi in term of high unemploy includ spain ireland belgium and franc the uk ha alreadi join the frai thei too would have to free themselv from the shackl of

in so endeavour to look my most alert i ask what will the higg boson do for the taxpay it is on veri veri major step in understand the wai the univers is put togeth he repli if you ask why anyon

fermilab who ask by a us congression committe what the lab contribut to the defenc of the nation repli noth but it make it worth defend it s part of mankind s histori to be curiou about how thing work the professor ad we re try to find out at the deepest level what matter is made of why the univers is the wai it is and not some other wai hi second argument wa not surprisingli about direct and indirect spin off but he did not labour it the discoveri of new fundament law of physic usual had import practic applic such as the discoveri of the electron howev that wa get harder to be sure of the further physic move awai from everydai experi so i don t think you can justifi the expenditur on those ground technic develop wa anoth kind of spin off for exampl the collis detector pioneer by georg charpak of cern and for which he won a nobel prize in 1992 were us for medic imag acceler were emploi for cancer therapi that s not the reason you do it but it give some return and you should subtract

schoolchildren to scienc even if thei end up in engin rather than cosmolog while graduat student acquir valuabl if expens train at cern but i said the search for knowledg is the real reason it is the

boson will be detect by machin three storei high in a microcosm of what wa go on a fraction of a billionth of a second after the big bang which began the univers the higg particl wa postul year ago by prof peter higg of edinburgh univers to explain why some particl ar massiv some massless llewellyn smith said it would help us understand why some forc of natur oper over vast distanc other over minut distanc and why matter is clump as it is thi research can tell us why the univers is arrang with island of star call galaxi why it ha thi architectur i think these ar pretti interest question and if you do not find it there must be some mechan if it s not the higg we don t know what it is but we re go to discov someth els instead which we haven t been clever enough to imagin but what about the cost i ask can you not see a point at which politician will stop be interest i would sai that convinc politican is not so hard to a certain extent the hardest peopl to persuad ar peopl in other field of scienc becaus thei ar well jealou is the right word i guess it s difficult for peopl do biologi who need onli a few thousand pound a tini fraction of what is go into cern so you get the argument why not do biologi it s cheaper than physic but by the same argument why not do theologi it s cheaper than biologi there s a rather nice quot from a french boulevardist on of whose charact ask why he should pai 15 franc for an umbrella when he can have a beer for two sou i thought of the us decis to cancel it dollar 10bn superconduct super collid in texa which would have been three time the length of cern s scientif advanc were quit cheap in the past i said can we justifi our thirst for knowledg indefinit well that s our job in particl physic we have kept the cost down the budget of cern in real term is less than it wa 20 year ago despit the fact that the number of physicist who work here is five time bigger the sfr2 23bn materi cost of the larg hadron collid will not involv more than about sfr500m of new monei the bulk will come out of cern s exist budget current sfr900m a year as it other experi wind down the two new detector cost sfr350m each mai be financ out of univers research budget peopl sometim sai it s like the opera and should be subsidis at the same level i think it s more than that becaus scientif knowledg is cumul it s more like the composit of an opera than the perform if you like the discoveri made in the 19th centuri ar still drive todai s electr industri for exampl and those in the 30s ar drive semiconductor you mai be abl to appeal to politician or to nation or european pride i said but won t taxpay protest if thei can t understand what you re up to that s why i think we have a big oblig to explain what we re do for a grand reason and a pragmat reason the grand reason is that we d like other peopl to share in the pleasur we get in the thing we re do and if it is a contribut to cultur then presum we can all share it the pragmat reason obvious is if we can t explain then obvious we re go to lose the support of cours i said i m impress you can look at the state of the univers some fraction of a billionth of a second after the big bang but i d pai a lot more to know what happen a fraction befor in a sens the big bang is infinit far awai in term of it energi densiti in time it s a finit wai awai but we never will realli get there the energi at which on could directli test the theori that put all the forc togeth is still a factor of about a million billion awai in term of energi it s an interest question what is in scienc and what isn t i think to paraphras st augustin the most profound question that human be can ask is why is there someth rather than noth now that question it seem to me is beyond the scope of scienc and probabl will alwai be though there ar scientist who think not on the other hand the question we re ask in particl physic is given that there is someth rather than noth why is it what it is rather than someth els and that question i think we mai be abl to answer would it be better for you if the result ar a shock better than get the predict answer ye it s paradox that show there s a real question there so when you find the higg boson it s go to be both a triumph and an anti climax in a sens to find someth differ would be more interest ye that s true if thei find the boson do you get a

LA031289-0143: despit doubt on fund collid retain it allur nobel laureat leon lederman look over a crowd of sever hundr scientist and industrialist attend a recent symposium in new orlean and quip we just want to understand how the univers work after we have done that we will go awai what lederman and other high energi physicist want is for the feder govern to spend more than 6 billion on the largest scientif instrument ever built a giant race track that thei hope will smash subatom particl into smaller particl than anyon ha ever detect befor why becaus physicist believ the machin call the superconduct super collid could simul the begin of time open a window on the moment the univers began the machin will hurl two beam of proton atom nuclei in opposit direct around a 53 mile race track the violent collis of proton travel at nearli the speed of light will creat subatom particl mani of which have not exist in natur sinc the begin of time competit for fund the propos come at a time of stagger feder deficit and increas concern about hous for the poor skyrocket health cost and other everydai matter yet it enjoi widespread support in congress among a broad spectrum of elect offici mani of whom ar quick to admit thei do not understand what the super collid is all about i ve becom a buff said rep jimmi hay d la who repres an impoverish district along the gulf coast that kind of attitud reveal the polit acumen of scientist and govern offici who have manag to build a broad base of support for the super collid mani elect offici came aboard initi becaus thei thought the project might end up in their state bring with it thousand of job and the prestig that on of the world s premier scientif research project is bound to garner in all 35 site were propos but sinc last januari when the us depart of energi pick a site near dalla mani thought congression support would declin quickli after offici realiz thei were not go to land the project for their area unquestion some support ha wane but the project is still veri much aliv more than 100 million ha been spent on research and design of the instrument and if the current budget request is approv construct will begin sometim next year it is schedul for complet in 1995 but that depend on continu support by congress i never thought louisiana would be a finalist hay said of hi state s bid for the project unless thei want to put it under water he ad in refer to the swampland that cover so much of louisiana at the cut edg yet he remain commit becaus the super collid is a symbol he said in an interview thi is the cut edg of technolog if our countri is not the symbol of scientif achiev we will forfeit that to europ or anyon els who is will to make the invest particl physicist who tend to regard their role in life as virtual a religi call tend to wax eloqu minu the polit when discuss their field high energi physic is the ultim extens of man s curios about what thing ar made of and how thei work said harvard univers prof roi f schwitter who is to serv as director of the super collid project mani other howev believ the price mai simpli be too high i keep ask where is the monei go to come from rep mike espi d miss told the new orlean symposium espi a member of the hous budget committe repeatedli told the symposium that if the super collid is built the cost will come out of the hide of mani other project and he offer littl hope that it will be fund but he glanc at repres of the texa organ who help win the project for their state and note but you have a coupl of 800 pound gorilla in your corner and on of them is name georg bush even physicist ar split the cost of build the super collid ha split the scientif commun becaus mani fear it will drain fund awai from other project even physicist ar not unit in support of the project there is a fundament question here said cornel univers physicist jame krumhansl presid of the american physic societi how do you assign prioriti krumhansl said the cost of the super collid would doubl the nation s budget for research in physic but the same amount of monei could be us to fund the research of about 5 000 physicist a year in smaller grant mani of those would be for research in such area as superconduct which could pai immedi dividend while the payoff from the super collid will be essenti zero for mani year while declar that the super collid violat the command that thou shalt not stick your finger in some other gui s goodi pie krumhansl suggest that plan to build the super collid now with so mani other research project beg for monei mai not be prudent it s the super collid project reason he said carefulli in it time and place although the super collid wa conceiv under the ronald reagan administr presid bush is believ to be a support but when he wa go over the text of hi recent budget address a funni thing happen on the wai to a joint session of congress although the prepar text specif push for the super collid the presid drop the refer from hi speech high profil target some believ the presid decid that if he mention it the super collid would becom a high profil target for it critic and there ar mani and he decid at the last minut to take a quieter path that doe not mean the bush administr is back awai from the project accord to robert hunter director of the offic of energi research in the us depart of energi which hope to build the super collid hunter said in an interview that he fulli expect the super collid to be built presid bush is not back awai from the super collid said presidenti scienc advis william r graham he veri strongli support it the bet among insid is that the project mai get the 250 million call for in the current budget propos which includ 160 million to begin the first stage of construct but year two will be much more difficult as hay put it texa is put up 1 billion toward the project the schedul call for the fund to jump to 392 million for fiscal 1991 and 494 million by 1992 the total price tag ha been peg at 5 9 billion by the depart of energi but mani believ that figur is actual far below what the super collid will ultim cost 8 billion project mani of my colleagu believ we ar look at an 8 billion project said rep carl d pursel r mich a staunch support of the super collid despit the fact that hi state lost out earli in the competit that is a lot of monei for a project that is difficult to understand and mai never directli improv the live of the peopl who ar ask to pai the bill sinc by it veri natur the super collid will be design to probe the unknown no on know what if ani practic reward the giant machin will yield it predecessor like the world s largest collid now oper the tevatron at the fermi nation acceler laboratori near chicago have led to applic in field rang from medicin to star war but no on knew if ani practic good would come from the tevatron befor it wa built i m frequent ask if those result were unpredict what ar the unpredict result we can expect from the super collid said lederman who is the director of fermilab mani of the spinoff from earlier collid result from the develop of new technolog requir to build them but the super collid reli on exist technolog and mai not lead to new breakthrough it will not be all that differ from the tevatron at fermilab but it will be a lot bigger and thu far more power not an atom smasher the super collid is frequent refer to as an atom smasher although that is not technic correct the collid will produc head on collis of proton thu it is a particl acceler not an atom smasher becaus it will not smash atom it will howev tear proton to shred a magnet field creat by 10 000 magnet made of 60 million feet of superconduct copper cabl will acceler two beam of proton to nearli the speed of light in opposit direct around the 53 mile underground race track the beam will cross six time produc about 100 million collis per second in each of six interact hall the energi in each of those collis will approach 40 trillion electron volt 20 time greater than the highest energi avail in ani other collid in the world todai each time two proton collid the amount of energi transfer will be equival to the energi produc at that instant by all the power plant on earth concentr in a region 100 000 time smaller than the diamet of a proton each collis will smash the proton but it will not simpli break them into piec at that energi the collis will creat some new particl that have not exist sinc the birth of the univers the process is similar to two truck crash into each other head on and produc wreckag that includ a sport car a motorcycl two bicycl and a wide assort of vehicl that no on had ever seen befor project s onli purpos and that essenti is all that the largest pure scienc project ever envisag will be design to do but to high energi physicist it will be a thing of great beauti in a time so brief that it is to a second what a second is to 100 000 time the ag of the univers scientist will be abl to observ what the univers wa like at the moment of creation as it is so often refer to in technic literatur at that time particl physicist like to point out there wa onli particl physic the effort to re creat the begin of time is consid an arrog goal by some scientist but to other is pure scienc a quest for noth more than understand it is a quest that some scientist fear the nation mai be forfeit to other later thi year fermilab s tevatron will no longer be the world s most power collid that mantl will go instead to the european high energi physic center near geneva call cern the onli wai to regain that lead is to build the super collid a project so costli that it ha pit scientist against scientist becaus of fear that it would drain fund awai from less exot but equal promis endeavor thi project all along ha not had an easi road the energi depart s hunter said substanti amount it s ask for a substanti amount of monei he ad but it is the right answer for how to maintain our leadership in thi field lederman who admit he is concern that the super collid could siphon off fund from hi own laboratori ha said repeatedli that the most import spinoff from the super collid could well be someth that is veri hard to put a price on as a young man he said he becam enchant by a newspap stori about physicist who had travel to a mountaintop to studi radiat from space becaus of their effort he said he decid to becom a scientist last year he wa award the nobel prize for physic the world s not go to end if we don t build the super collid note

that soviet author had until now ban ani version except their own our knowledg of the holocaust is veri uncertain said veniamin belitski a mathemat teacher who conduct after school class on jewish cultur and histori we know of cours what the holocaust is but as histor fact it is rather abstract we know too what the great patriot war as we call world war ii wa for our countri but we do not fulli understand how on relat to the other mani of us have a person knowledg of the holocaust as well event we live through or our parent or aunt and uncl live through and told us about but again we have difficulti relat these littl piec to the whole thi for ani person would be a matter of shame but for a jew that shame should be veri great in the current soviet histori of world war ii the nazi persecut and extermin of an estim 6 million european jew from 1933 to 1945 is treat not as hitler s final solut of the jewish question but simpli as further evid of the evil natur of fascism and the need for the intern struggl that final defeat it brief mention the 1972 edit of the authorit great soviet encyclopedia summar the holocaust in a singl paragraph in a lengthi articl on jew and give it onli two line in an even longer articl on anti semit it is bare mention in the encyclopedia s detail histori of world war ii when the wiesenth center translat the panel into russian for public in a booklet no singl word could be found for holocaust we had to us the phrase jewish catastroph gerald margoli the center director said the reason is that soviet histori ha never dealt with the extermin of jew as jew the wai thei were mark for elimin and the wai that their annihil wa carri out what happen to jew in the soviet union is submerg in what happen to the countri as a whole yet quit clearli quit object what happen to jew wa differ of an estim 4 8 million jew live on soviet held territori when germani invad in 1941 as mani as half were kill accord to alec nove and j a newth british specialist on the soviet union us soviet censu record nove and newth have calcul that in some region less than a fifth of the jewish popul surviv the war the holocaust wa no secret from us we knew what had happen mikhail livshitz anoth visitor said as he tour the exhibit the survivor told us and thi becam part of our ident as jew that ha been pass from father to son from mother to daughter but these were memori not histori if you look for the histori of the holocaust you could not find it in the soviet union some writer of cours have dealt brave and sympathet with what happen to jew but real knowledg and understand of the holocaust ar still rare anatoli kuznetzov who later defect and di in the west wrote a documentari novel that wa publish in 1966 with mani chang by govern censor

the victim came where much of the kill went on cannot or will not face up to thi it rais mani question of why the answer some soviet historian now acknowledg li first in the past need of the soviet communist parti to identifi the great nationalist struggl to defeat the nazi with the parti s own need to defend social and it leadership of the countri eli wiesel award the nobel peac prize in 1986

of the utmost import to us as jew for the natur of the holocaust to be recogn while look at the monument at babi yar wiesel said i wa angri and asham eighti thousand jew were kill at babi yar and the

that continu for 30 year khrushchev and mao also feud person khrushchev who had both a temper and a loos tongu call mao thing like old galosh and other thing that ar too earthi to repeat and mao told peopl he found khrushchev stupid and half liter medvedev said each knew that the other would hear chines specialist howev trace the conflict back even further to relat between czarist russia and the chines empir in the 17th 18th and 19th centuri when in beij s view larg tract of territori hundr of thousand of squar mile in siberia central asia and the soviet far east were taken from it and
