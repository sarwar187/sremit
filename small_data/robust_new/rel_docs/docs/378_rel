major there is noth to sai about great britain s relationship with europ just like everi other european union eu countri we have our own idea about what is right for the eu not becaus we have a british point of view but becaus we have a european on der spiegel could you give an exampl major why did i refus to ratifi the social claus in maastricht becaus i believ the provis of maastricht make it more difficult for unemploi european to find a job and those who do have a job will lose it all the sooner the reason wage in europ ar higher than among our oversea competitor the unit state japan or the countri of the pacif region der spiegel unemploy in europ is approach the 20 million mark major great britain is the onli major countri in which unemploy is fall on reason for thi is that we have reach the next phase of the econom cycl but our social cost ar also lower than in the rest of europ manpow is cheaper here therefor there ar higher invest and employ ar more will to hire new peopl that is why i did not accept the maastricht social claus my argument appli to the whole of europ and ar not just a british odditi der spiegel nevertheless on doe not have the impress that great britain li in the heart of europ as you would like it to do major what doe in the heart of europ mean i have no intent of adher to some eu fad if i am not convinc thei ar correct be in the heart of europ mean be abl jointli to determin the rate of chang der spiegel in which sphere have you implement thi right to joint determin major in the expans of the eu made possibl through the allianc between germani and great britain after all i can also claim to occupi a good posit in matter concern social guidelin and the principl of subsidiari in thi sphere too we and germani have revers the trend toward central on quarter of eu legisl will either be abolish or reword we have push through our desir to a major extent also concern the shape of the european budget until the end of the centuri be in the middl of europ doe not mean compet against our eu partner to see who enjoi the greatest popular it mean have a clear view of what should happen we inde determin europ s direct der spiegel the euroskept in your parti still think britain s real strength li in isol from the contin major that is simpli wrong onli a tini minor would prefer it if we did not belong to the eu most of the skeptic fear that we ar let ourselv becom enmesh in a central europ which thei do not find attract but the overwhelm major of conserv believ that britain s place is in europ and thei want us to plai an increas role in creat the kind if europ that will emerg in the nearest futur in case anyon doubt our commit let me tell him that my govern ha fought more polit battl concern the maastricht treati than the rest of europ der spiegel but you yourself succumb to an anti european chauvin when you and your eu partner start the disput about block minor and veto right in the council of minist major no if it is such a good idea to have a firm major in order to implement resolut why wa there such strong agreement with germani and other countri that we should reform thi system in 1996 der spiegel the forthcom govern confer is meant to discuss institut reform in order to make the eu more effici and better abl to reach decis major we ar alreadi oppos to a new major vote without wait for 1996 on reason is that the brussel commiss is try by mean of articl 18 that deal with labor and trade union issu to introduc the social charter through the back door if we were to increas the block minor in the council of minist to 27 vote without seek approv in the come month we would receiv a whole seri of decre that ar unaccept to the british parliament i could not accept that not until we had been assur that there would be no further resolut that would increas unemploy in thi countri did i grant my consent der spiegel if an associ were to grow by 33 percent not even the intern cricket confer the govern bodi for your favorit sport would avoid adopt a suitabl modifi veto right major to adher to your metaphor when someon belong to a club is it not obviou that he should obei it rule i will tell you what upset me the most whenev necessari germani franc spain and itali defend anyth thei consid a matter of nation interest but no on accus them of be anti european when thei do so der spiegel that is good is it not how do you explain it major you should explain not i to be frank i do not accept the empti accus of us be anti european everi time we hold a differ stanc to the on that is current in fashion in the eu der spiegel on the contin peopl still have the impress that great britain doe not have it heart in the eu and that it is mere interest in a more advantag free trade zone major that is wrong and alwai ha been it might appli to a hand of peopl but not to our govern polici der spiegel perhap the disput about the block minor also ha someth to do with british fear of be involv in a german domin europ or in a franco german european core major that is nonsens i have no fear of be imprison in a german domin unit europ as you put it the stanc of germani and britain ar similar on mani topic for instanc on the subject of subsidiar and an expans of the eu there ha been complet accord between us on these import topic recent der spiegel london and bonn also seem to share the biggest doubt about the european monetari union emu major my skeptic is base on the expect econom outcom of the emu let us assum that the emu come into oper in 1997 1998 or 1999 as plan if we then have a common currenc and want to be success all european econom mechan must be more effici and link more close by then but i do not know anyon who think even an approxim of the emu can be achiev therefor there is not go to be an emu der spiegel so you ar declar the emu defunct major even when we were still negoti maastricht i said europ would not be readi for a singl currenc in 1999 i wa not displai british chauvin mere econom judgment i am still sure i am right der spiegel do you think it is time to set greater emphasi on nation ident onc again major nation ident ha never been eras there ar area where on can pool nation claim there would then be a veto in secur matter in order to protect sphere of nation interest the remaind of the eu would not interfer with these that is how the whole thing work der spiegel obvious more thing join the unit kingdom and germani than divid them but how do you explain the increas discord in thi partnership major i see no polit differ between the govern der spiegel wa that just an invent of the media major obvious your inform is base on the result of the latest opinion poll wherebi the british and german do not trust each other so much der spiegel accord to thi poll the british and german have less trust in each other than in the case of the american and japanes major that wa a rather irrelev question whenev i am in the compani of british and german there is consensu on most issu der spiegel but you cannot deni that britain fear a germani that determin the balanc of power in the center of europ major ye i can in ani case i have no such fear der spiegel but your predecessor margaret thatcher did major i cannot speak for her when german unif occur i consid thi event histor inevit we welcom it and were right to do so chancellor kohl had no choic but to push the unif process through der spiegel in that case how do you explain all the anti german remark and cartoon in part of the british press major i cannot speak on behalf of the british press der spiegel there ar also differ of opinion concern the forthcom celebr of the 50th anniversari of d dai chancellor kohl would like to attend a ceremoni of reconcili major as far as i know helmut never want to be involv in these celebr next year on the 50th anniversari of the end of the war there will be joint appear and ceremoni of reconcili germani will take part then but thi is not up to me thi is someth that ha to be discuss with a lot of peopl and organ der spiegel you ar meet chancellor kohl thi week should the debat on basic eu principl schedul for 1996 not cover european secur and militari polici as well major the chancellor and i have met mani time our meet ar free and uninhibit we will probabl hold most of our talk dure a walk at my countri seat chequer der spiegel perhap you will take kohl to the sauna for some sweat like bori yeltsin major i have no sauna at chequer unfortun we will certainli also discuss what plan germani ha for it eu presid in the second half of 1994 that will be a major topic der spiegel kohl ha alreadi said that he will cooper with the french veri close thei will take over the eu presid after germani major i hope he cooper close with all partner der spiegel there is littl trace of joint west european action in the balkan why ha the eu fail in bosnia major i think the eu did act jointli but it happen under the auspic of the unit nation der spiegel now and then concern for exampl the disput on the accept of slovenia and croatia it look as if west europ ha revert to the old pattern of mistrust that exist at the begin of thi centuri major at the begin of the civil war in bosnia there were onli three option to remain complet outsid the conflict and let the war side simpli do what thei want the second option would have meant that the western democraci stop the war in former yugoslavia der spiegel and attack with their forc major do you know what would have happen then a war ha never been won with the sole us of air power even in iraq it wa the ground forc that determin the outcom down in the balkan we ar deal with 200 000 arm serb croat and bosnian who ar fight in hilli terrain how mani nato troop would we have to deploi in order to end the fight the militari reckon 400 000 or more would be need todai der spiegel todai perhap but noth like that number would have been need if the west had undertaken action two year ago major no no thi figur wa establish alreadi at the begin of the civil war 400 000 soldier where were thei suppos to come from der spiegel certainli not from germani major i know that but not from other countri either the truth is that we cannot deploi 400 000 soldier we british have sent troop on humanitarian mission and that wa the third option to steer a solut and in the meantim do everyth possibl to step up humanitarian aid der spiegel and what is the result of thi polici in bosnia todai the serb have been abl to attain their territori object and a peac treati to cement these gain would also sanction ethnic expuls major ar you ask question or do you wish to discuss thing with me der spiegel both major we do not know how matter will end yet it is obviou that the boundari must be redrawn everyon should now discuss thi and if you insist that troop should have been sent in i would certainli like to know where these troop were suppos to have come from der spiegel if the serbian aggressor extend their ethnic conflict to kosovo and macedonia i do not suppos you will attack either major we will deal with thi matter when it happen but in ani case i am not go to sit and argu with you about what we ar go to do in ani case it ha not yet happen on reason for thi is the presenc of unit nation unit there der spiegel what sort of involv in the balkan conflict do you expect from the german with their constitut restraint and histor burden major the german have assum a great burden in thi war on cannot underestim the financi cost thei have incur by accept balkan refuge that is an extraordinari commit and a highli conspicu contribut der spiegel mr prime minist in the wake of all the euroturbul your leadership qualiti ar onc again under fire especi within your own parti is it a consol to you that right now most european govern leader ar lose their elector becaus of the econom recess and social miseri major quit so all over europ even in great

be in offic by the end of the year major i have a lot to do and no time to indulg in such specul but let me recal the period befor the last elect everyon wa convinc i would not win that wa two year ago and i expect to be abl to answer your question for some time yet der spiegel you ar fond of sai that polit is a rough busi but you would rather go yourself than be thrown out of offic major i will

excess of the boom bust cycl equal we could have avoid the clash over erm entri in 1989 which ruptur irretriev the onc solid troika which nigel lawson and i had form with margaret thatcher on cannot

intergovernment confer to draft an emu treati would becom inevit britain would be isol and there would be littl chanc of hold back the delor rout to a singl currenc the prime minist wa deepli annoi by

same dai we exchang no further word on the matter she lock herself into her hotel room on arriv it is therefor instruct to record more fulli than she doe in her memoir what happen the next dai there wa widespread expect that margaret thatcher would object to emu lock stock and barrel howev when the prime minist spoke she said that the hanov european council had agre that there should be concret stage lead to the progress realis of emu and we should be pragmat the delor report she said wa right to go for a stage approach to emu and it analysi wa valuabl we were readi she said here and now to

margaret thatcher wa unforthcom about why she want me to leav the foreign offic she said simpli that it wa lack of agreement over europ it is therefor all the more surpris that she still claim not to
