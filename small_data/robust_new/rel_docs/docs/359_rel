FT944-14599: ft 21 oct 94 ft quarterli review of person financ 28 past perform can be a guid how to choos them 2 a research explain why he question the orthodox wealth warn there is a widespread view that it is virtual imposs to pick the unit trust perform of tomorrow base on the perform of yesterdai but mani academ and analyst argu that thi is not the case there doe exist a relationship between past and futur perform admittedli it is not widespread but it is there my first rule is to understand that the kei to fund select is to pinpoint those fund whose past perform provid evid of manageri abil manageri abil is the critic determin of long run invest success it is also rare in fact it is so uncommon that the total return of most unit trust ar caus by a combin of luck and risk rather than skill rule two then is to be sure that whatev is describ as past perform doe in fact measur manageri abil and not luck or skill in other word in order to judg the worth of a past perform it is necessari to be clear about the caus of that perform unfortun the standard approach to thi task simpli take a fund s total return rel to it sector as evid of manageri perform thi is a mistak when total return ar taken as the sole measur of perform all three of the caus of the total return risk luck and skill ar roll into on but from the view of perform assess onli on of these skill is of ani real worth tabl 1 show the top 20 fund from the intern growth unit trust sector thei have been rank in the standard wai offer to offer cumul total return over the five year to the end of august 1994 now look at column two which show each fund s volatil or risk as measur by the standard deviat of each fund s monthli total return over the same five year the rang of risk profil is huge column three the risk index show that the riski of these fund vari from 92 per cent of the sector averag to 163 per cent of the sector averag almost twice as much the fact that the four riskiest fund in thi group have four of the five highest return is no coincid it is evid of how the fund ha achiev it total return so my rule three is alwai rememb that risk caus return the widespread failur to understand thi is on of the main reason why it is difficult to find a relationship between perform past and futur the relationship exist but it exist between manageri abil past and manageri abil futur not total return past and total return futur rule number four is that return must alwai be adjust for risk in order to measur manageri abil here s an exampl in tabl 2 i have again taken the five year perform of the top 20 fund from the intern growth sector thi time the fund have been rank on the basi of their risk adjust or risk return and the chang in rank rel to the total return rank in tabl 1 have also been shown risk return express the amount of return that ha been garner for each unit of risk it is calcul by take each fund s averag month on month offer to offer total return and then divid thi averag by the standard deviat ie risk of those monthli total return risk adjust return enabl us to evalu the worth of each fund s perform if we know that risk caus return then fund that have a veri high risk return can be said to have less of their return explain by risk and more by skill we do need to know howev at what point skill is more in plai than risk and for that we need a benchmark the benchmark provid a perform standard with which we can measur the impact of a fund manag s decis make an index such as the ft se a all share for broadli base uk unit trust or the s p 500 for broadli base us on fulfil thi role indic such as these produc total return that ar the product of no manageri decis at all fund that ar abl to beat the index on a risk adjust basi therefor can be said to have ad valu if thei underperform thei have subtract it it is virtual imposs to beat a benchmark or index without superior inform in other word skill the sign of manageri abil then is risk adjust outperform of an appropri benchmark over a five year period thi is rule number five base decis on manageri abil also make great sens becaus unless someth veri import chang skill is stabl thi is rule number six understand that in order for a fund that ha done well in the past to do well in the futur the caus of that success ha to follow a stabl pattern rememb thi will not show up in the sector total return rank take a look at the chart 1 and 2 in gartmor british growth s case the start point of the trendlin in the chart is the five year risk adjust perform from decemb 29 1986 to decemb 29 1991 and for perpetu high incom it is the five year to decemb 29 1992 the trendlin then show the pattern of each fund s risk return as a ratio of the ft se a all share s risk return for each roll five year period in the 31 subsequ month to date for gartmor british growth and 19 month for perpetu high incom the kei featur here is whether the fund s trendlin is consist abov the valu 1 0 thi valu repres the risk adjust return of the ft se a all share in both case although the risk return jump up and down a bit the valu is alwai abov 1 0 that is both have consist outperform the all share index in other word the manageri abil of both fund ha been stabl thi is the type of inform upon which fund select decis should alwai be base by contrast the perform of gt incom and m g dividend ar consist below 1 0 that is thei have been consist valu subtractor although someth import is go on at gt incom the chart show that it ha been improv steadili sinc a new manag wa put in place the golden rule in fund select is to base decis upon evid of manageri abil that is stabl unless someth import give thi will ensur that the fund s outperform of it benchmark in the past will continu into the futur to
