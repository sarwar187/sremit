for treatment mr han s rise to the world stage is at least partli due to increas labour unrest and to beij s desper to keep a lid on it accord to hong kong base french sinologist jean phillip beja beij ha to contend with two differ group of labour the first ar the estim 120 million urban dweller who have offici statu as worker most of them labour in the factori and surviv on the iron rice bowl guarante pai and benefit for govern employe or us to thei fall under the leaki umbrella of the state union the all china feder of trade organis the second and larger group is the roughli 180 million worker in the special econom zone privat compani and rural cottag industri the artisan of the so call chines miracl mr beja sai these ar the peasant and farmer on the move who have no offici statu and ar not consid worker peopl usual talk about them at lunar new year and then forget about them these ar also the peopl who di in the zhili toi factori and the taiwan fund gaofu textil factori in fuzhou the chines govern s biggest worri howev ha been how to keep urban labour happi in the state enterpris most of which ar bleed monei the recur problem ha been how to close them down when there is no safeti net for the laid off worker beij s solut to keep them content wa to implement what mr beja call the half lai off if you have a coupl the man might continu work in the factori while the wife wa allow to open a small busi such as a restaur but she would still receiv 70 per cent of her pai the govern encourag thi as a cushion for inflat mr beja sai thi work for a while but then last year beij began to print monei to cover it debt then thei didn t have enough to pai the worker mao s armi suddenli found thei were be ask to work longer shift with less and less to show for it the china labour bulletin give an exampl of a union investig into wage among mine forestri and textil industri in heilongjiang thei found that employe in 10 citi were ow 2 66 billion yuan about 70 per cent had receiv their chequ three to six month late and even then wage had fail to keep up with inflat benefit had also been cut in theori when a worker pai a medic bill he goe to the factori to be repaid mr han sai now when he goe to the unit leader the leader sai the factori doesn t have ani monei mr beja said some union repres at first tri to defend labour right but found themselv in an increasingli awkward posit becaus thei also work for the state eventu thei had to take a stand against the worker he sai manag even tri to get monei for them but thei just couldn t do it thei had to take a stand too mr beja sai thi ha caus a huge dilemma for the leadership reform argu that the answer is to introduc shock therapi as wa done in poland and russia conserv sai that the worker will revolt and anywai thei argu sure the parti is suppos to repres the labour as a result noth is be done the govern is in a veri embarrass situat but the sanction proletariat ha it easi compar to the peasant in the cottag industri who earn about half the pai of the state employe a chines worker in a privat factori earn about us 20 a month mr han sai prison make us 1 a month it s not that differ unoffici worker ar badli exploit and often work in terribl condit those peopl realli depend on the open market economi mr beja sai no on look out for their interest although the govern sai there ar law in place to protect worker you would never know it by visit a chines factori for exampl it is against the law to have what is known as three in on factori where the plant warehous and sleep quarter ar connect howev you find them all along the southeast coast and mani belong to hong kong compani includ the zhili factori where 84 peopl burn to death when thei found themselv lock in their dormitori the dilemma face beij is that china s greatest attract is it cheap and unregul labour forc but worker ar get tire of wait for the benefit of the reform to trickl down last year the number of strike and walkout began to increas the govern s respons wa to crack down accord to an asia watch report on polit dissid releas last month the number arrest in 1993 wa the highest sinc the post tiananmen roundup outsid of tibet arrest of labour began to race ahead of polit dissid worker were given the stiffest sentenc mr munro sai the govern is vigil about a solidar type movement accord to mr han these problem have alwai been there but have becom more visibl and wors under deng s reform befor onli the state had the power to exploit worker but with the reform entrepreneur and foreign investor also have that freedom it s like frost on the snow under normal circumst he sai worker could complain to an independ union but in china the union is paid by the state he sai he sai china ha never understood the role of union in releas pressur on labour tension in 1947 there were two union on belong to the nationalist who us the union to maintain power the other belong to the communist who us the union to take the power awai thei don t understand that union don t have to threaten the state but the govern is confus about it role in most case it us to be the employ but it is not ani longer if it understand it role is to mediat it can remov itself from thi mess if not the communist parti will destroi itself that is where mr han come in he sai if thing keep go like thei ar the result could be a violent explos if the govern face an econom crisi thei mai have to further undercut the well be of the worker that could lead to a mass upris in the street in which no individu or group will be respons we don t want to see it happen becaus anoth upris will lead to suppress which mean violenc brutal and chao and that won t lead us anywher mr han believ the onli answer is for the govern to introduc free trade union that is what he hope to make worker realis with hi bulletin unlik other activist he sai he will never suggest that anyon oppos the govern everyth must be done within the law howev that is what mr han told hi interrog in 1989 to no avail as he wrote in hi appeal upon hi parol i am here repeat what i have said mani time as a chines citizen the constitut gave me the right to associ with other and speak my mind of cours hi bulletin should also be protect by thi constitut right but if he were allow back into china he would almost certainli be arrest perhap what is most astonish is that mr han is still try to go back befor hi lawyer wa pick up last week he wa in the process of file yet anoth appeal against hi expuls while most peopl will sai he is crazi mr beja sai he repres the attitud of younger worker thei ar threaten by the reform and thei have absolut no wai to protect themselv if there is a market economi everyon is against you as to mr han s wish to return mr beja sai he think that to make thing advanc you need to sacrific some peopl just don t care i won t give up my determin to go home mr han sai mayb thei will put me in prison mayb even kill me but i don t want
