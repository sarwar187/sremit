250 000 case ar regist annual in our countri these ar onli the acut and obviou case of infect while in fact it is believ that thi figur is underst by a factor of 10 perhap onli acut respiratori diseas afflict peopl more often and as for the number of fatal and complic there ar no equal to thi infect medic worker of the develop countri in which the fight against viral hepat ha been rais to the rank of a state program came to understand thi long ago reli on laboratori test medic worker can distinguish hepat todai into type a the dirti hand diseas and type b so call serum hepat five other variant ar not recogn by russian statist and thei ar classifi by a process of elimin as a mix group neither a nor b in russia hepat a is encount more often than the other type make up 60 70 percent of all hepat case in adult and 70 80 percent in children as with ani other intestin infect hepat a is typifi by season occurr and so it is now in fall that epidemiologist ar note an increas in morbid especi

better to boil all drink water and if you happen to make contact with a person who ha the diseas be on guard for 5 week medic worker advis caution to tourist to develop countri of asia and africa thi infect is extrem widespread there and most of the popul suffer the diseas in earli childhood western tourist make an effort to immun themselv against hepat a there is a specif vaccin alreadi and clinic test have proven it to be highli effect such a prepar ha also been develop in russia it studi ha just begun and therefor we need to follow the rule that save the drown is a matter for the drown themselv and thi is in fact possibl the scandinavian countri where the hepat a is an extrem rare phenomenon ar an exampl of thi isol case for everi 100 000 popul for comparison the figur is up to 100 in certain region of our countri at least anoth two type of hepat ar transmit by dirti hand hepat e ha now been studi suffici well thi type occur most often in develop countri russian ar absolut defenseless befor it and it cours is much more seriou than that of hepat a vaccin against thi infect ar not even avail yet abroad and therefor the sole defens is to observ the rule of person and social hygien and now let s talk about the form of hepat for which blood is the gatewai in the earli 1960s the american scientist blamberg discov a characterist serum protein of hepat viru for which he wa subsequ award the nobel prize sinc that time a real possibl ha appear for doctor to distinguish between onli two type of hepat by blood test a and b detect of a protein antigen specif to hepat b in blood made it possibl to us thi marker to determin the extent of blood infect modern test method ar so sensit that thei can detect a quantiti of viru of less than 1 gm in a billion trial thi quantiti of viru by the wai is fulli suffici to caus diseas for thi the viru need to find the slightest break in the skin or mucou membran of the recipi enter the blood through it and then reach the liver with it flow the liver is the onli place in the human bodi where hepat b viru can multipli infect person react various to what happen in the liver as a result total differ cours appear viru carrier acut infect chronic hepat cirrhosi and cancer of the liver it is not at all necessari for jaundic to accompani acut hepat b medic worker note that the begin of diseas can recal the pattern of intestin infect and even ear nose and throat diseas especi among children the main thing is that the liver is enlarg which is someth you have to know how to detect a diagnosi as to precis what type of hepat is present can be establish onli after a number of special laboratori test to prevent infect of patient receiv transfus of blood plasma it prepar and compon all blood procur from donor must be test mandatorili such test have been conduct in our countri for 20 year alreadi but for some reason post transfus hepat continu to be a frequent phenomenon could it be becaus the blood servic ha been us test of veri low sensit in develop countri where a veri seriou effort ha now been made for over 10 year to test blood for hepat b it proport in the structur of hepat after blood transfus ha been reduc to 10 percent nineti percent of hepat is associ there with infect by yet anoth viru hepat c thi viru resist detect for a long time and what is interest is that the test for thi infect wa develop befor the agent itself wa describ in 1989 a check of donor in mani countri of the world reveal that a signific part of the world s popul is afflict with hepat c what rais concern is the fact that presenc of infect can be judg onli indirectli for the moment by reveal antibodi to the viru as for exampl in the case of aid and syphili which significantli reduc the true number of infect individu todai most develop and develop countri have introduc mandatori test of blood for hepat c into their blood servic thi isn t as success of cours as in the case of hepat b nonetheless todai thi is the onli mean of prevent post transfus hepat c it mai be said that blood is not yet be test for thi infect in our countri if hepat is so widespread it is fulli logic to suppos that it is transmit not onli by donat blood but also by other pathwai in fact hepat b is astound in the divers of the mean by which the bodi is infect children fate to be born from mother who ar carrier of the infect or who contract the diseas dure pregnanc and not necessarili in it jaundic form fall into the risk group thi is why hepat b test of pregnant women is mandatori in mani countri hepat b is transmit sexual the viru is detect in sperm and in vagin secret a special risk group ha been determin prostitut who ar breed ground of infect unfortun there ar few who know that hepat b is even categor as a vener diseas for thi reason the slightest break in a partner s mucou membran is enough for the viru to get into the blood these two pathwai vertic from mother to child and horizont sexual perhap domin in variou develop countri in which it is believ that over 20 percent of the popul is infect it ha been note that entir famili mai be infect with hepat b viru we know of on moscow famili in which a newborn infant contract the diseas in the hospit the mother wa then infect from the child dure breast feed and final the father of the child manag to catch the diseas from the mother neither the sexual nor

those who receiv poorli test blood on the basi of vital indic carri the greatest risk of fall ill thi is well known to medic worker but thei ar powerless if materi support to the us of high qualiti blood test is insuffici ar there realli no other wai of stop hepat b and c besid blood test in 30 year of scientif research in thi field some thing have alreadi been accomplish creation of a specif

c and it can be suppos in fact no on know thi precis mani more ar infect with hepat b it is the agent of thi diseas in particular that is more widespread than of all the other hepat and it is into the bargain more danger it is follow hepat b in particular that cancer frequent develop to an even greater degre than from hepat c if on look at the problem from opposit perspect it turn out that the viru of hepat c is found in nineti per cent of patient with cirrhosi and cancer of the liver the situat is complic by the fact that the major of oncolog patient ar also treat among other method by mean of the scalpel and ar transfus with donat blood and that no on can state with certainti that ill fate hepat is not introduc into these patient with thi blood becaus here we do not carri out such investig if that is the case and most like it is the case then frequent oper oncolog patient die not of the cancer but of subsequ complic like acut hepat insuffici but after all that s how matter turn it s not

much such analys for the hepat c content would cost understand we did not do such analys and inde thei ar not done now i donut know perhap thei ar in special except case but it is necessari to do them if for no other reason than otherwis the consequ will be unpredict peopl who by the veri charact of their work know the natur of the hepat viru transmit with blood ar ring the alarm attempt to attract

million peopl pass through russia s medic hospit a year peopl who is oper on and transfus with blood ar treat conserv but thei must all be administ drug intraven and that is the path of infect all els

valuabl foreign exchang for the dprk and a mean of procur good and materi difficult to produc domest when measur ar taken to ban japan dprk trade it is predict the follow effect will be seen last year s figur reveal that the major commod export from japan to the dprk were textil for spin and textil product about 27 percent of the total export follow by machineri which made up about 18 percent electr machineri and tool which compris about 11 percent and transport machineri and tool which made up about 8 percent of singl item variou textil aerial pump and compressor automobil and agricultur chemic were the leader on the export list if the dprk wa unabl to import such item it export of cloth to japan us japanes textil materi would ceas and the dprk economi would come to a standstil through the lack of machineri transport equip and tool stop the import of agricultur chemic would greatli escal damag to dprk agricultur which is alreadi suffer from noxiou insect on the other hand there is almost no foodstuff or fuel export from japan to the dprk and if trade wa suspend there would be littl effect on the dprk as far as these item ar concern howev when north korean live in japan travel to the dprk and dprk ship visit japanes port thei take out of japan a consider quantiti of foodstuff and fuel which do not appear on the custom statist when ship and peopl ar prohibit from move between the two countri it will have a certain effect see subsect b in case travel is ban and dprk ship ar prevent from enter japanes port in addit trade firm affili with chosen soren have long been suspect of export cocom prohibit contraband good to the dprk via third countri if thi is true sanction will not be effect unless export to third countri by chosen soren affili trade compani ar stop in addit an increas watchdog system mai be necessari to prevent smuggl and secret transact by sea writer s note 1 when impos econom sanction the dprk oil suppli situat is a major factor the biggest concern of the japanes us and rok govern in impos econom sanction is the threat of militari adventur on the part of dprk in order to prevent it stop oil import which provid the fuel for armor troop and militari aircraft is an absolut condit us and rok militari sourc differ in their assess of the dprk oil stockpil with some guess that the dprk ha fortifi underground oil storag dump although no figur ar avail western diplomat sourc in seoul share the view that the dprk probabl ha six month s worth of reserv in store mani expert therefor point out that dprk troop ar like to invad when thei ar

trade and industri for a permit to export 700 comput to indonesia it wa discov that the export wa intend for dprk via singapor and the applic wa turn down it must be point out that chosen soren util it subordin organ in method send a larg number of book on high technolog and that the subordin associ of scienc and technolog of north korean in japan ha under it fold member engag in highli advanc technolog and leader who ar specialist and have been train by the japanes author in nuclear physic end of note b in case travel is ban and the entri of dprk ship into japanes port is ban last year an aggreg total of about 6 600 north korean visit the dprk from japan and by august thi year about 1 800 had made the visit about 4 300 japanes visit dprk last year dprk ship made a total of 510 entri to

if visit to the dprk by north korean in japan and the entri of dprk ship into japanes port were ban it would affect the work of variou dprk organ and the daili live of those who have repatri from japan approxim 93 000 peopl among the japanes who visit the dprk last year about 600 were engag in either trade negoti or technic counsel japan rank second after china as a dprk foreign trade partner and the major of the timeworn plant facil in the dprk which have been brought in from japan need frequent repair and check if visit by japanes technician were restrict it presum plant oper would be affect a great deal about 3 000 japanes tourist visit dprk last year and thi year about 600 have visit so far it is said that a japanes tourist spend about 50 000 yen while in dprk so it is estim that the dprk earn about 150 million yen annual in tourism revenu the japanes constitut the largest number of tourist to dprk and a ban of their travel would certainli affect the dprk foreign exchang earn dprk vessel load sever time the volum of crude oil need for the voyag claim the oil as good need follow departur from japanes port and let chosen soren affili trade compani pai the bill assum the 510 dprk ship that enter japanes port last year load crude oil in quantiti more than actual requir sever hundr thousand ton of crude oil ar suppos to have been transport into the dprk ban dprk ship from enter japanes port will result in a lack of fuel requir for voyag of these vessel c in case rout of fund remitt ar close although the dprk foreign exchang reserv have not been made public it is presum that countri is in an extrem seriou situat in view of the fact that the dprk ha not succeed in revers it deficit figur in foreign trade and that it method of trade transact with china and russia ha chang from the barter system to settlement by intern currenc in view of thi a constant flow of fund from japan to the dprk trade payment contribut from chosen soren and so on is on of the dprk major sourc of foreign exchang the amount of monei sent to the dprk from japan as invest in dprk compani exceed 30 million yen for which a report to the ministri of financ is requir credit in excess of 10

remitt from japan to the dprk if the payment not requir to be report to the financ ministri ar count a consider larg amount of monei is presum to be sent to the dprk through bank thu the dprk will be dealt with a big blow if remitt to the dprk through bank ar prohibit as for the japanes bank which have sign correspond transact agreement with dprk bank see the diagram below diagram 1 to be sent

by skillfulli scatter and conceal them in their luggag in order to cut off remitt by chosen soren to the dprk therefor it is necessari to examin such measur as step up check into remitt via third

remit monei to their famili in the dprk without give specif reason for do so leader of the korean associ of commerc and industri in japan conced that befor famili receiv the monei about 30 percent is taken off the top under variou pretext by the dprk author more seriou problem exist as well becaus mani of the leader of the associ ar ag anxieti is spread among them that the dprk govern mai exact

instanc of remit monei to the dprk after collect it oversea rather than directli remit it from japan end of note 3 reaction of the dprk and chosen soren a the dprk domest reaction when concern nation impos econom sanction in accord with a unit nation resolut demand econom sanction against the dprk the follow trend ar consid possibl frequent riot mai occur due to food shortag it ha so far been report that the dprk ha wit riot due to food shortag seriou food shortag mai spread onc econom sanction ar impos if riot take place continu throughout the countri and ar organ as a form of outrag against the present system thei mai quit possibl lead to the collaps of the present regim in order to avoid such a situat the dprk parti and govern will tighten it control of peopl s thought and step up arrest and imprison of rebel exodu of dprk resid it is thought that when the domest economi of the dprk becom impoverish and food shortag becom wors due to econom sanction case of dprk resid escap to china or russia or attempt to seek asylum in the rok will occur but the number of such case mai be small unless the dprk current system collaps the dprk parti and govern ar expect to strengthen border patrol to prevent such action from occur in larg number seek assist from friendli nation the dprk mai seek assist from china to overcom econom sanction bilater trade between china and the dprk is about 700 million dollar of thi the frontier trade between the dprk and china s three northeast provinc amount to 100 million furthermor smuggl is report to be rampant along the border between the two countri if the dprk can acquisit vital good such as oil and food from china make good us of geograph advantag econom sanction cannot expect to yield result therefor as long as china doe not go along with econom sanction and show a cooper respons econom sanction mai be less effect request for chosen soren assist the dprk mai request that chosen soren help acquir materi and provid foreign exchang for chosen soren to carri thi out while send materi and monei from japan to the dprk is ban it mai resort to smuggl or send materi via third countri in order to avoid japanes safeguard there is a possibl that the dprk mai attempt to take over a total of approxim 2 400 billion yen held by the chosen credit union in japan an organ subordin to the chosen soren by claim that the monei belong to the dprk declin of militari strength the dprk mai face difficulti in maintain it militari strength due to the declin moral of it soldier caus in addit to food shortag by shortag of fuel for

order in march thi year in reaction to team spirit a joint us rok militari exercis when the situat develop into such a state that the domest economi goe complet broke and the system face a crisi it is expect to threaten concern countri by test launch missil and concentr it troop along the border in order to impli that continu econom sanction ar danger also it cannot be deni that the dprk would be prepar to launch missil and mai actual attack ship on watch duti at sea if concern nation impos a sea blockad in order to maxim the effect of econom sanction countermeasur against japan the dprk announc the follow countermeasur when the japanes govern impos sanction against the dprk follow the bomb of a korean air passeng plane 1 dprk diplomat will ceas all contact with japanes diplomat 2 japan s nation public servic personnel and pro govern person ar ban from enter the dprk 3 when japanes fish boat illeg trespass in the dprk exclus econom zone their fishermen will be punish accord to law the abov mention measur could be an acknowledg of the effect basic caus by the sanction measur impos by the japanes govern which japan enforc in a passiv manner therefor the dprk is expect to

year when such restrict will be cancel is not known if the dprk restrict on visit by japanes ar not cancel by the time econom sanction ar impos such restrict will continu b chosen soren if japan start

chairman yi chin kyu is the closest to the chairmanship by rank order but in realiti ho chong man vice chairman in charg and a cadr among the top leader of the commerc and industri associ is far ahead in reach true hegemoni in chosen soren it is expect that an intern struggl will continu until a gener meet is held next year what matter is the fact that vice chairman ho chong man ha broad connect in the japanes polit world and ha engag in activ lobbi among influenti diet member concern the issu of econom sanction against the dprk it is fear that polit maneuv is be stage in favor of the dprk end of note 2 effect and reaction of militari sanction 1 predict form of militari sanction as for militari sanction against the dprk the secur council is given such author by articl 42 of the unit nation

mention abov is adopt the dprk will inevit have to strengthen it combat mobil readi to the highest level in order to resist such a measur in that case the dprk will presum mobil it massiv organ of men

sector of the economi includ construct site from product to the militari field to step up combat mobil readi when that occur the econom sector will have to bear a seriou burden and if the situat drag on for a long time shoulder the burden of maintain combat mobil readi is expect to becom unbear for the economi which is alreadi in a wretch situat and face mani difficulti if thi situat turn out to be a realiti it is consid possibl that critic from everi social stratum will pour out against secretari kim chong il who is reput to be the planner as well as promot of the stubborn foreign polici for invit such a situat meanwhil incit by extern threat chauvinist as well as nationalist sentiment mai well be enhanc at the same time it is therefor difficult to determin whether the dprk leadership s author will immedi becom shaki b if measur 3 1 attack on nuclear facil and so on mention abov is adopt the unit state will most like launch or lead limit bomb on specif facil and the oper will probabl be highli success militarili destroi the target with minor damag to the attack when the unit state and the dprk militari hardwar is compar under these circumst secretari kim chong il who recent assum the most respons militari posit in the dprk will suffer an inevit fall in hi author in combin with an inquiri into who is respons for bring about the result of pursu a stubborn foreign polici critic of kim chong il mai surfac in addit the militari will onc again be arous to recogn the poor qualiti of it equip and lead cadr mai critic the whole militari polici center around parti led thought c if measur 3 2 attack on the suprem leader mention abov is adopt the unit state ha a past record of carri out militari action bomb and missil attack appar intend to elimin kill the suprem leader of libya and iraq it cannot be deni that similar militari action mai be taken against the dprk base on the understand that the elimin of both kim il song and kim chong il might hopefulli bring about a chang in that countri s polit system as past experi show howev these oper did not accomplish their object and it is highli unpredict as to which of the follow result will be brought about if the oper is launch a both kim il song and kim chong il die b kim il song surviv while kim chong il di c kim il song di while kim chong il surviv d both kim il song and kim chong il surviv in the case of a as a short term effect nation uniti will be solidifi as the result of anger at the kill of their leader but after the excit di down a success struggl for leadership will take place follow the loss of absolut centripet forc the author of the parti and govern will be gone thu develop a situat in which the possibl of the regim s collaps is undeni in the case of b the confus envisag in case a will not occur immedi becaus kim il song is aliv but in consider of kim il song s advanc ag it is inevit that unrest will occur among the leadership with respect to expect revolv around the success problem moreov consider unrest can be anticip becaus there would be no immedi successor on the death of kim il song such as kim chong il who ha been prepar over a long time in the case of c it is expect that the effect of solidifi uniti center around kim chong il will occur in thi case there is high probabl that ask kim chong il to take respons as suprem militari leader as mention earlier will not surfac immedi becaus indign over the kill of kim il song will surpass consider of the former in the case of d the author of kim chong il as suprem militari leader will be promot and there is a consider strong possibl that it mai serv to strengthen the system becaus propaganda then becom possibl claim the enemi attack ha been repuls on top of domest indign over such an attack writer s note 4 anoth factor to be taken into consider is the health of 88 year old presid kim il song in spite of variou rumor littl data is avail the clinic record of kim il song whom a former east german secret polic

ar veri complex it ha been diagnos as a benign tumor end of note 3 the dprk and chosen soren s respons and their effect on japan a the dprk a form of respons from an outsid s perspect the dprk ha frequent taken unpredict action and it is therefor extrem difficult to forecast how it will respond if emerg measur such as sanction ar taken but theoret it gener respons ar presum flexibl realist respons to settl the nuclear issu will be shown in the make of new compromis propos reopen of interrupt negoti and so on propaganda by step up extern propaganda to stress the dprk is a victim of us power polici and make appeal to win the sympathi of world opinion it will aim at stop sanction from be impos threat it will make public that the dprk will launch appropri arm retali against concern

sanction will be taken war in declar the dprk deem sanction a declar of war it will begin an allout arm invas of the rok b variou sanction and predict respons the respons list abov will be specif made in respons to the form of sanction taken and thei ar as follow in the case of measur 1 arm threat or measur 2 sea blockad the dprk is expect to mainli carri out propaganda and at time it will be mix with threat and terrorist act to shake up intern opinion and have sanction cancel in the end but if sanction ar impos for an extend period of time and the domest economi is driven to an unbear difficult state there is a chanc of flexibl regard measur 3 1 attack on nuclear facil there is a high probabl the dprk base on the judgment that arm retali increas the possibl of far larger attack from oppon and lead to a crisi in the system will attempt to wage a propaganda war to win the sympathi of intern opinion thu restor it author but if the dprk come to the conclus that such a lukewarm

the attack will produc vari respons gener speak the more seriou the unrest within the system the greater the possibl it will react violent in despair on the other hand if the system s stabil is

FBIS4-33295: cso articl by heinz dieterich steffan text havana to becom or remain on of the first class nation sai konrad seitz director of the strateg plan depart of the german ministri of foreign affair there is onli on rout to master on of the five kei technolog of the futur world market comput biotechnolog space technolog new form of energi and new materi of these technolog the most import sai noam chomski is biotechnolog to thi opinion of the german strategist should be ad a second condit for admiss or perman membership in the first world be an independ state with suffici autonomi and polit determin in deal with the major world power center to defend a develop project base on nation interest in light of both of these paramet the futur of the latin american countri appear dismal with the except of costa rica which is not repres of latin america cuba is the onli countri that meet these two requisit and therefor the onli on with a good probabl of leav underdevelop behind the real independ of the cuban state requir no further demonstr and of these five technolog of the futur cuba is now on of the world leader with the unit state in the on that is most import biotechnolog and genet engin by the year 2000 thi market will have a volum of 200 billion and cuba will domin a larg part of it the follow report present a summari of numer interview with director of cuban biomed and biotechnolog institut and provid the most extens account that ha yet been publish abroad on the spectacular advanc made by the cuban biotechnolog school thi lack of inform is not due to ani cuban clamp down on the flow of inform but instead to the virtual censorship of report of ani success of the cuban process a censorship that prevail in almost all of the western commun media aid vaccin as in other laboratori all over the world cuba is also do intens work on the scourg of aid that accord to who world health organ estim ha to date afflict 12 million peopl in mani countri it is now on of the lead caus of death in mexico it wa in fourth place in 1991 the cuban biotechnolog school s battl against aid is be wage on three front the develop of a vaccin against the viru the design of accur and inexpens diagnost system for massiv us in blood bank and with the popul and develop medic to treat opportunist infect that is diseas that occur becaus of the aid induc weaken of the immun system the cigb genet engin and biotechnolog center is on of the most import center work to develop an aid vaccin in a 62 000 squar meter facil near havana over 600 scientist most of whom ar young produc 160 differ product 30 of them develop through genet engin it scientif staff ha expertis in all of the modern methodolog necessari includ genet engin molecular biologi and immunolog and advanc biochemistri and it ha the most advanc research and product hardwar in the world as reveal by an inspect tour of it lab and industri facil dr manuel limonta the director of the institut and of it scientif board state cuba will have an aid vaccin by 2000 or earlier he sai thei have a work group that is develop a vaccin against aid us genet engin technolog to prevent the diseas thi is a strong group which ha alreadi been work on thi program for a long period of time and the group ha produc signific result limonta did not describ these signific result but from other sourc we deduc that thei have manag to isol and character the specif viral strain respons for hiv and that thei ar now in the laboratori test phase the cigb director express confid that thei will manag to bring aid under control immunolog and state categor we ar go to develop a vaccin dieterich steffan befor the french or american do limonta i do not know if it will happen befor but i believ it mai be befor 2000 that is my person belief i think it mai be earlier than that or it mai be around that time that is my view of the matter if it were not dr limonta make thi pronounc it might appear somewhat rash but limonta is a heavyweight in thi field and hi person achiev and those of the institut he direct lend author to hi assert in support of thi the director of the cnic nation center for scientif research dr carlo gutierrez sai that limonta and hi team practic live in their lab when thei ar try to solv someth thei ar extraordinarili dedic to the work thei ar do and if thei make such a statement thei ar capabl of do it he recal their achiev with interferon as an exampl when limonta work with a small team of young research propos produc interferon in cuba peopl were talk of a minimum time frame of three to four year thei did it in 42 dai a truli record time as everyon recogn on the lengthi list of the success of the cigb and it director mani achiev in close collabor with other cuban scientif institut there ar nearli 160 differ product that have been develop by the cigb includ about 30 produc through genet engin from start to finish these ar recombin product to convei an idea of what thi mean dr limonta explain that in what is known as the third world cuba is the onli countri that ha develop from start to finish product through the us of genet engin which ar known and regist product and which ar export such product have not been develop in ani of the other countri even in countri that ar much larger than cuba like china or india just in 1993 the us patent and trademark offic in washington regist three patent for the cigb by so do it recogn the origin of the product and that cuba is the onli countri with the technolog and the methodolog to produc them it also recogn that the qualiti of these product meet the food and drug administr standard the most stringent in the world and grant cuba the exclus right to produc and sell these product in us territori for 17 year these product includ a prevent medic for myocardi infarct call estreptoquinasa regist as no 07 703 778 the first vaccin for mening bc develop anywher in the world 07 754 918 and the invertas sucros enzym which convert sugar into fructos for estreptoquinasa cuba with the except of on us firm is the onli countri that ha produc thi medic sai limonta he explain that thi product can dissolv clot in coronari arteri thi medicin is capabl of elimin clot in a high percentag of patient when it is administ immedi after the infarct and it prevent the infarct from progress so it act as a prevent for myocardi infarct the patent registr for thi product ha alreadi been appli for in over 40 countri thei ar go to grant it for we know that we ar the onli on who have develop an origin process to make thi medic get a patent of thi type reflect the high technolog capabl of our institut in thi case the technolog is genet engin studi of the drug produc in the unit state have demonstr that it biolog effect is similar to that of the cuban product howev the cuban medic is much cheaper than the us drug estreptoquinasa wa also develop in record time from the time when the idea wa first conceiv until the product wa regist as a medic onli four year elaps on the averag in cuba product ar develop in less time than in us and japanes compani we have a studi done by us and japanes scientist that sai that we ar 1 3 time more product than thei ar in term of the time requir to complet a product and put it to us while compli with all the legal requir in practic thi higher product coeffici mai mean for exampl that a us or japanes product which requir 10 year for research and product mai be develop in seven year in cuba the explan offer by the cuban scientist for such a surpris phenomenon is complex but thei all agre that the educ and scientif philosophi of the revolut of which these young peopl ar the result is the kei factor anoth spectacular success of the cigb is what is known as nerv growth factor which is still not known elsewher in the world sai limonta becaus nobodi els ha been abl to develop it thi medic a protein is us to regener nervou system damag and it could also be us in a diseas like alzheim s the product ha now enter the industri product phase which will enabl it to be us in clinic trial genet alter anim and plant anoth line of research the cigb is pursu is the genet modif of anim and plant to date thei have produc transgen mice rabbit and fish their goal is now to produc a genet alter cow limonta explain that in these anim a new trait or genet inform is introduc in the fertil ovum which the anim assimil as it own and transmit hereditarili in thi wai genet chang can be produc and new speci can even be creat the specif object is to make mammal milk in thi case cow s milk also produc medic the cow is an excel milk produc laboratori if we can introduc in thi laboratori the intellig enabl it in addit to milk to also produc specif protein then we could have for exampl interferon product in cow it all seem quit simpl we would not need a complex and costli industri interferon product process which requir the us of ferment equip close monitor etc the entir process would be done sole in the anim we would extract the product from the milk and the milk would then be us normal dieterich steffan that sound like scienc fiction limonta ye but it is go to happen i am absolut sure of it we have alreadi done it we have obtain medic in rabbit milk dieterich steffan do intern specialist know thi limonta the on who read intern public do first we did thi with mice to test the methodolog then we us rabbit to improv the methodolog and produc medic that wa again success and now we ar work to produc medic in larger anim in cow we have not done that yet but we ar go to growth hormon manuel limonta also discuss the cigb progress in the control and us of growth hormon we have work on fish and in thi area we realli have on of the most advanc group in the world we introduc the genet inform contain in the growth hormon in fish thi caus the fish to grow veri rapidli thei do not reach a larger size than normal but thei do so more quickli becaus thei incorpor their food better the time save can be half or an even larger percentag compar with the normal growth period the fish in thi case tilapia a carp ar still not reproduc in larg quantiti but the fundament step ha been taken in the field of anim health thei have creat for the first time anywher in the world a vaccin against cattl tick for which the patent is now be regist in brazil argentina mexico and other countri the develop of a vaccin against porcin colibacillosi a diseas whose mortal rate among newborn pig is 100 percent is anoth notabl scientif achiev at the present time a more advanc version of thi vaccin is be develop in the area of plant health the us of biotechnolog ha result in the increas of plant resist to specif pest a transgen tobacco ha been produc which resist the manduca septa moth an insect that destroi the tobacco leaf with thi genet modif the moth is kill without damag the leaf thi is accomplish without alter the plant s characterist a potato that is resist to on of the three type of viru that affect it seed is anoth cigb achiev thei ar now work to develop resist against the other two thei have also produc a genet alter cabbag with a moth resist gene thei have also develop a transgen sugarcan the first time in the world that a genet alter sugarcan ha been develop to have a sugarcan that is more resist to some pest other achiev on of the cigb big achiev is the recombin vaccin against hepat b which is now us in over 20 countri in cuba it is given to all newborn as part of a nationwid program anoth complet new product now regist in cuba and some other countri but which is still not avail on the market is skin growth factor which is us to treat burn some other import product includ human monoclin antibodi for treatment and in the industri area new enzym on of these enzym is invertas sucros which transform sugar into fructos when fructos is us to sweeten or to improv flavor the amount of sugar need is reduc by 20 to 30 percent the method and technolog us for it industri applic ar exclus cuban against aid on the second front against aid it diagnosi cuba ha three differ techniqu the first wa develop by the aid research laboratori the second by the cigb and the third by the cie immunoassai center in discuss the cigb techniqu dr limonta comment that uniqu diagnost method have been develop for exampl we have the aubio system in which a drop of blood deposit on a plastic strip react with a seri of genet engin compon we deposit on the plastic strip structur similar to the protein of the compon of the viru membran plu a gold base dye when the drop of blood come into contact with the plastic strip a chang in color is produc which indic simpli by sight whether the person ha been infect thi system ha also been develop for us in diagnos toxoplasmosi hepat c etc and it us is now be expand to other ill it offer the advantag of not requir special equip to mix the blood and read the result and doe not even requir a technician or electr current as the result is visibl in ordinari natur light a differ method ha been develop by the cie it ha substanti improv the classic method of immunodiagnosi by reduc the amount of the blood sampl and reagent by 10 percent the efficaci of thi diagnost method ultra micro elisa hiv ha been demonstr in mani countri as well as in intern evalu by the aid refer center affili with the world health organ and paho pan american health organ for exampl in brazil canada and also in cuba itself now the cie is market an aid diagnost kit in mani countri which anyon can bui in drugstor the kit contain a paper filter a pipett to extract a blood sampl from the finger and a form the blood sampl is allow to dry on the filter the person select an anonym person code and list it on the form for exampl abc 345 and then send the dri blood sampl to a laboratori an autom reader like the cuban suma read the test and determin with a margin of accuraci of virtual 100 percent whether that person is hiv posit the person later call the laboratori give hi anonym person code and receiv the result with absolut confidenti and privaci thi system is now us in mani countri includ spain where it us ha been approv by the ministri of health and consum affair the market price is on the averag between 20 and 30 percent less than the price of other product and the cie provid technic personnel and technic analyt or instrument assist as need thi is veri conveni sai the cie director of qualiti control dr rene robaina becaus when an institut like a blood bank need assist we ar there we provid complet attent that includ everyth from the lab setup personnel train and later assist anoth advantag of thi person aid diagnosi regist internation under the name of hipertest is that the paper filter contain the blood sampl can be sent by mail or messeng as it is highli stabl onc it is dry it will last for month without the accuraci of the diagnosi be alter the hipertest is not sold in mexico but thi could be done perfectli well we simpli have to find a transfer mechan sai robaina similar for exampl to what we have in the form of joint capit ventur in russia brazil colombia spain china ghana etc the test is produc exclus in the immunoassai center the filter paper which must have an extrem homogen qualiti is import from germani the chemic reagent also come from the world market while the biolog reagent ar mostli produc in cuba the technolog is exclus cuban at the cnic medicin ar be develop against diseas that occur becaus of the weaken of immunolog defens caus by aid we ar work on medic to allevi aid we still cannot cure it sai dr carlo gutierrez but we can try to get rid of the other diseas we know there ar medic that have slightli lengthen the live of patient and we ar try to do that we ar investig the possibl of a combin of those medic and we ar now at a more advanc level than laboratori test from the laboratori we then go to bench test then to the pilot plant and final to the industri plant we ar now at the bench test stage if we can produc thi medic we could extend patient live more vaccin the finlai institut with an area of 23 000 squar meter unequal in latin america and on of the most modern in the world ha 650 employe it develop the world s first vaccin against mening and in 1990 it wa award a gold model by the unit nation world intellectu properti organ for thi achiev thi vaccin wa develop in bare five year the research had to work with live microorgan creat a high risk of infect as there is no other vaccin we took all possibl hygien precaut explain dr concepcion carma director of the institut and coordin of the research group that develop the vaccin but we had to work with larg volum of bacteria we ar talk of kilogram of live bacteria that were grown in larg 300 liter ferment vat and that wa a real risk the first volunt who us the vaccin were the research themselv becaus as a matter of ethic polici we believ that what we could not put in ourselv we could not ask anyon els to try and when we test the vaccin in children we appli the same ethic standard our own children were the first on who us the vaccin onli later did we go to field test explain the doctor thi vaccin is now be us in a number of latin american countri argentina chile colombia etc where mening is preval in brazil over 20 million dose have been administ without ani sever advers reaction be report in the cuban trial the vaccin demonstr an efficaci of 83 to 98 percent anoth import line of research is the anticholera vaccin which ha alreadi undergon laboratori test with import result when the anim test is complet the three phase of trial with human be will begin follow by field test which will have to be done in some latin american countri as cuba is the onli countri in the hemispher where cholera doe not exist against myocardi infarct at the entri to the cnic in havana the visitor can read a statement by fidel castro the futur of our nation necessarili belong to men of scienc in thi institut which is the leader and promot of cuban biotechnolog that quotat ha becom a realiti as it major achiev attest among them is ppg policosanol which combat on of the princip risk factor for infarct high cholesterol level ppg which began to be market in august 1991 wa develop from compon found in sugarcan whose solut have properti that reduc certain type of cholesterol at thi time 200 000 cuban ar us ppg regularli and the result ar posit in term of the patient physic psycholog and even sexual reaction the medic ha now been approv for us in 12 countri and it patent applic is pend in 22 more countri each pill cost 1 and the minimum recommend dosag is on tablet a dai other product whose action is similar to that of ppg the estatina mean unknown ar from 1 5 to two time more expens thei ar also try to extract from sugarcan the raw materi to produc phytosteroid in order to manufactur steroid hormon the basic element of anticontracept pill the cnic ha develop the new product beyond the laboratori stage which includ test with anim and it is now in the pilot plant level anoth of the island s natur resourc that is be us in biomedicin and biotechnolog is cuba s coral reef sinc the cuban revolut ha been care with the nation s ecolog the coral ar practic free from pollut dr gutierrez feel that the coral in human medicin ar better than synthet materi becaus synthet materi introduc molecul that mai be detriment to the human organ so at least in secondari aspect natur materi outperform artifici materi scientif studi have reveal that certain speci of coral ar materi that can be us for transplant or graft due to their great biocompat with human bone tissu both becaus of their ideal architectur a porou structur that is tridimension interconnect and becaus of their physico mechan and biochem properti calcium phosphat ozon therapi a treatment develop by the cnic that is uniqu in the world is the us of ozon therapi in treat retin pigmentosa which if left untreat lead to blind with the us of ozon therapi the advanc of the diseas ha been halt and patient sight ha been improv we have been see patient for two year sai dr gutierrez and thei have not gotten wors but improv thi ha not been done anywher els in the world origin the equip that convert oxygen into ozon wa import and cuban then develop innov applic for ozon for both therapeut and industri us at the cimeq medic and surgic research center ozon therapi is be us to dissolv compon of blood clot after five year of anim experi the treatment wa appli to human be for coronari and cerebr diseas the techniqu is still in an experiment stage but it is now be us for arteri obstruct in the lower extrem as an altern to dilat or laser treatment the result have been present at intern confer in vienna pari brazil and uruguai anoth import line of research that the cnic is pursu is the us of monoclin antibodi for diagnos plant diseas for exampl there is a product that diagnos the tristeza babesia viru which attack citru crop thi diseas doe not exist in cuba but purchas of citru fruit requir proof that the fruit doe not have thi diseas by us thi diagnost tool thi is easi to demonstr medic equip for diagnos in clinic neurophysiolog of the central nervou system computer equip ha been develop like the neuronica or medicid the neuronica is us to measur visual and auditori percept and brain wave dure sleep the medicid is veri us in analyz the nervou system and cerebr function cerebr map for exampl it provid a computer readout of electroencephalogram eeg and displai the result on a monitor due to the us embargo cuban have produc all the comput program for thi equip which is now in us in mexico the diram is anoth computer devic that provid a rapid microbiolog diagnosi in four hour it determin with reliabl the type of infect and it pattern of sensit to antibiot antibiogram a diagnosi that requir 72 hour when convent method ar us by indic the most effect antibiot for a specif infect it avoid the develop of bacteri resist the ineffect us of antibiot and fatal outcom in seriou infect becaus of the short analysi time the small volum that it requir and it low cost it is possibl to corrobor the result as often as mai be desir anoth advantag of the system is that it can be us not onli for sampl of isol and purifi strain of bacteria but also for direct specimen from blood or urin cultur in first world countri equip with similar function doe exist but it is four to five time more expens the diram is faster and cheaper and cuba is now abl to export it the cie ha develop the suma ultramocroanalyt system for the low cost analysi of laboratori sampl thi is primarili us in the diagnosi of infecti diseas in blood bank in epidemiolog and for variou health program the suma is the result of 18 year of research and the cie in havana the produc of the equip ha suma laboratori in europ asia africa and latin america the equip is us to detect aid hepat b meningococcu alphafetoprotein etc in cuba the suma is us for the prenat diagnosi of virtual all pregnant women to detect congenit malform like neural tube defect and hypothyroid dengu and cholera the pedro kouri tropic medicin institut which is respons for protect the cuban popul from epidem of infecti diseas ha kept ani infecti diseas from africa from spread in cuba despit the return home of ten of thousand of cuban soldier to do so highli effici diagnost tool have been develop there is a diagnost system for dengu fever which is now in us in mani latin american countri report dr alina llop thi rapid detect diagnost kit for antibodi is sold commerci as a kit and thi is uniqu on the intern market similar kit have been develop to detect streptococcu group b which provid result in three hour in addit analys of mening infect and cholera which with convent method take no less than four dai can be obtain in eight hour with the new cuban molecular biologi diagnost system cuba is probabl the onli countri in latin america that ha these system anoth system of great import for the third world is a new diagnost tool for amebiasi which base on molecular biologi ha a 100 percent accuraci rate thi obvious elimin the uncertainti inher in convent method there ar also other biomed and bioscientif area for exampl the develop of comput for medic imag in which cuba is on of the world leader young scientist the kei factor that explain in the wide held opinion of the director interview the spectacular advanc of the cuban biotechnolog school is the prioriti that ha been given sinc 1959 to educ and public health thank to which thei now have a critic mass of young scientist of high qualiti creativ and disciplin the human factor is actual the onli element that differenti the cuban biotechnolog school from advanc laboratori in the unit state europ and japan all high tech laboratori us the same technolog equip which explain why a visitor who enter the technolog facil of the cuban research and product center will find the same type of swiss bioreactor huge japanes electron microscop german tomograph equip and french mass spectromet that their first world counterpart have and the same thing is true for the chemic and biolog raw materi that ar not produc in cuba the polit determin of the cuban state the effici network of cooper between research and product institut the unusu combin of

institut have necessarili had to work with european and japanes multin with us corpor remain outsid the commerci develop of thi enorm cuban potenti howev it is probabl that the us busi elit will not toler thi exclus for much longer instead it will probabl opt as it did with vietnam to cooper with cuban biotechnolog and that will be the raison d etr for put an end to the embargo cuba s continu emerg from isol throughout latin america and europ the reconcili with the miami exil and the extraordinari intern reform ar all lead in the same direct so if the cohes of the cuban model can resist

these report threshold in thi propos rulemak epa is attempt to add chemic to epcra section 313 that ar manufactur process or otherwis us in quantiti greater than the epcra section 313 volum threshold

those chemic that ar manufactur in trace amount in wast stream ar highli toxic at veri low dose level and have physic chemic or biolog properti that make the chemic persist for extend period in the
