it becam clear that what appear at first to be a northern new mexico curios wa in fact a nation public health emerg we were begin to collect patient daili duffi said it wa astonish when thei kept sai ye ye ye when ask about tryptophan us we never expect that it just had to be a caus effect relationship research do not know how to explain isol but appar similar case that have crop up in previou year on exampl is a 1986 case involv a woman take numer self prescrib vitamin and miner supplement that duffi and two colleagu describ in a januari 1988 articl in the mayo clinic proceed at the time the mayo clinic physician had no specif reason to ask the woman specif about tryptophan us but when duffi telephon her earlier thi month he found out that she had been on it for year and wa continu to do poorli ask if he thought tryptophan product were to blame for the patient s year of ill duffi said i would believ so the three index new mexico patient ar all much improv the patient who wa hospit stop take tryptophan supplement befor enter the hospit and her doctor start her on steroid therapi befor thei suspect the associ with the amino acid product the fluid in her abdomen and lung ha
