who head the divis of plastic and reconstruct surgeri at scripp bag and wrinkl ar minim but not eras if you hope to see the face of a 19 year old fashion model look back you re not alon most prospect plastic surgeri patient have the same unrealist expect rudolph said at a recent scripp symposium on rejuven ag skin at the four season hotel in newport beach then you get the patient who come into a physician s offic and ask for a mini face lift sai dr stephen h miller a plastic surgeon at scripp who chair the american board of plastic surgeri then she sai she ha an import social engag come up in four dai and she ha a minim amount of monei so she want to put it on her mastercard but she s 100 awai from her limit as the crowd chuckl miller fill in the caricatur and she doesn t want her husband to find out so she ask you to make sure he can t see the scar the present wa the first scripp ha made in orang counti and organ were overwhelm at the respons nearli 600 peopl mostli women attend the two hour session and more than 600 other who couldn t get in sign up for a futur session as the babi boom gener grow older the effect of ag and what can be done to slow or revers them have becom a hot topic rudolph said as skin ag it becom thinner drier and less elast he said although fat mai collect in other part of the bodi it diminish in the face and that contribut to wrinkl and sag sun exposur also caus surfac wrinkl surgeri can minim some of those problem and other can be help with chemic peel dermabras or collagen inject but so far nobodi ha figur out a wai to turn back time the scripp doctor said the first and possibl the most import step for a plastic surgeri patient is choos a doctor and that can be confus miller said a few year ago i would tell peopl to make sure their doctor were board certifi he said but that s not enough now becaus mani of the peopl who ar not approv by recogn medic societi have form their own board mani of the surgeri be perform ar by individu without the credenti necessari to be board certifi miller said he advis check with local hospit and colleagu befor choos a physician you have but on bodi to give he said be care to whom you entrust it it s import to discard those unrealist expect earli on miller said a common misconcept about face lift he said is that onc you ve had on you ll need anoth and anoth do you have to have it again no doe it last forev no he said some peopl if thei ar heavi with veri loos skin mai need the oper again within eight to 12 month face lift have improv from the old tightli pull artifici look to a more natur appear the doctor said a new techniqu involv tighten underli muscl as well which improv the effect price vari greatli but at scripp the typic face lift cost 4 600 to 6 200 the doctor said rudolph miller and dermatologist hubert t greenwai of the divis of dermatolog and cutan surgeri show sever befor and after slide of their patient mani of which drew ooh and ah from the audienc these women ar wear makeup on the post oper photo rudolph explain thi wa not intend to deceiv you but it s part of the process we send patient to a cosmetician afterward to learn how to us makeup and these pictur were shot when thei came in for their post oper visit i ll be darn if i ll ask somebodi to take off their makeup just for that but i want to make sure you know the improv is not just from the surgeri on advantag of ag skin rudolph said is that as you get older scar heal easier and less visibl on the face unfortun that s not true for the trunk and if you have surgeri there a breast augment or abdominoplasti a tummi tuck you will have a more visibl scar but no scar ever becom invis the advent of liposuct in which fatti tissu is liter vacuum out of the bodi ha given plastic surgeon anoth tool for sculpt face and bodi in addit to area of the bodi with larg accumul of fat doctor also us liposuct to remov bag from under the ey and tighten the neck but surgeri isn t alwai the answer said greenwai who explain such dermatolog techniqu as collagen inject chemic peel and dermabras collagen he said flatten deep furrow temporarili but is eventu absorb by the bodi some doctor in mexico have us liquid silicon for the same purpos but you have to be care with that we had on patient who got silicon inject in mexico and thei migrat into her cheek she look like a chipmunk chemic peel in which acid solut ar appli to the face peel off the skin s outer layer and dermabras which involv liter sand the skin ar sometim the best answer to fine wrinkl greenwai said but there ar side effect two week later you look like you ve been mug by a brillo pad he said both techniqu work best on light color skin retin a the anti wrinkl drug approv in 1988 mai not be as effect as first thought greenwai said it wa initi test on the forearm and it seem to work better there than on the face the chang ar veri subtl he also advis against go to tijuana to bui retin a over the counter what you bui there mai or mai not be retin a he said although the audienc wa mostli women the doctor said more men have begun to embrac plastic surgeri it s no longer dismiss as surgeri for vaniti s sake miller said it s becom cultur and emotion accept becaus you ar a whole person and what you look like doe have an effect on how you feel about yourself to dismiss that as vaniti seem awfulli shortsight
