peopl the libyan peopl on order from america britain and franc is prohibit from perform the rite of pilgrimag the pilgrimag that take place in an arab land we tell our brother of the islam nation we draw their attent to the difficult situat of the sacr hous of god the kaaba in mecca concern which the falsifi secur council resolut were implement with american threat thei had been implement on holi mecca and the tomb of the prophet when an airplan take off from libya it is not allow to cross saudi air space or to land while carri pilgrim to mecca and medina our brother who ar stand in the pilgrim wai and who ar prevent us from arriv for pilgrimag ar in an unenvi situat the poor thei ar in such a situat that we do not want to put more pressur on them nor do we want to further expos them perhap it is their econom condit spiritu and materi weak their helpless and their limit percept that have made them seek protect with the american white hous and oblig them to carri out the decis of the christian state against the pilgrimag and pilgrim but at the same time we sai that america ought to be grate to the arab to the white hand symbol of assist that wa extend to it in time of need passag omit america is in a situat of difficulti and distress the arab help hand wa extend to it it should have kiss thi hand and the american presid should have bow to the saudi king who hand out 6 billion currenc not specifi to america in an histor transact that save america from a crush econom crisi yesterdai saudi arabia conclud a transact to the valu of 6 billion dollar for the purchas of civil aircraft that saudi arabia doe not need howev the arab legendari generos made saudi arabia extend a help hand to america at a difficult time the american should recogn the saudi good deed becaus it save 100 000 american employe who were go to be made redund and becom beggar on the pavement of american street the 6 billion dollar confirm 100 000 peopl in their job these peopl were on the brink

thei reject hi mediat and did not meet hi request while he had done them favor and he ha got influenc passag omit it seem that our brother in saudi arabia ar implement thi nobl sai of the prophet and consid that the american hand stretch out to them to beg for monei need to be help we can onli address the islam confer organ that includ more than 40 islam countri and tell them that mecca is in a

becom a fact peopl have bar us from the holi mosqu these ar arab those on the wai and those who have the holi mosqu on their land thi like god said should not push us to enmiti and ruptur with them we do take note of their difficult circumst and their weak in front of the us monster thei acknowledg the domin of christian and judaism and the allianc of the zionist and the crusad thei ar afraid that thei might be the target of god s punish consequ thei put pressur on their libyan brother thei prevent them from visit the holi place as a favor to satisfi the christian state passag omit i hope that such act would not provok you into attack your brother in saudi arabia sudan or egypt becaus these peopl have been target and their turn will come to side with the west and the us against libya thei ar forc to bow becaus of their circumt regard egypt it econom situat is a dire on so on should not blame it it need a help hand and support it is be target and there is a zionist jewish christian plot to balkan egypt and divid it into sever state war ha been declar against egypt now egypt is be fought from within in it street order ar given from tel aviv washington pari london bonn and berlin order ar given from christian and jewish capit to destroi egypt and algeria egypt s econom condit do not allow it to oppos the unit state dure the current phase therefor we should unit with egypt support egypt s economi and take advantag from egypt s back for our economi we should be strong to emerg from the phase of weak to the phase of strength then and then onli egypt can stand up to the unit state and stand up to other countri as for sudan likewis it econom circumst ar veri bad war wa declar against it from the south thei creat poison insect for it which thei refer to in their languag as niania thei stress that thei should sow the poison insect in southern sudan you must have heard of niania 1 niania 2 and niania 3 everi now and then a movement emerg in the south to destroi sudan thi plot is be hatch by the jew and the christian to target sudan prevent uniti between egypt and sudan and weaken sudan even sudan is in a veri difficult situat howev the countri that is go through a complet differ situat is your sisterli saudi arabia econom speak saudi arabia doe not need the unit state the latter doe not provid saudi arabia with ani econom support on the contrari it is saudi arabia that is provid econom back to the unit state as we all know as you have wit it ha just suppli it with 6 billion dollar in return for plane that saudi arabia doe not need if saudi arabia need to reli on the unit state to defend it we would like to ask the follow question to defend it against whom now saudi arabia claim that iraq repres a danger against saudi arabia if saudi independ depend on us forc thi kind of independ is a hollow on becaus the unit state can withdraw it forc at ani time and becaus there mai be a us administr that doe not agre with the principl of defend saudi arabia henc saudi arabia should unit with iraq if kuwait independ depend on the presenc of us troop in the countri it should unit with iraq or with saudi arabia or jordan or libya libya tell the truth it sai that the libyan armi with it artilleri tank or radar equip cannot fight nato therefor libya stress that the arab strength li in their uniti libya s independ remain a fragil on as long as there is no arab uniti from the atlant to the gulf thi uniti will becom a deterr forc against the greedi western colon we ar us to their greed aggress and lack of merci we ar sai paus we ar call for immedi uniti we cannot reli on other forc when the soviet union still exist it made a request to set up militari base in libya to protect libya from the unit state we reject that we said that that wa not accept if our independ is depend on your presenc in our territori that will not be independ it would mean that we have sold independ the other side will take us when you withdraw your forc therefor thi is not a solut the solut li in the uniti of the arab peopl we know that saudi arabia need the unit state in the militari polit and secur sphere howev the unit state need saudi arabia even more econom what is prevent our brother in saudi arabia from be bold with the unit state the unit state should at least accept their view we cannot accept thi situat for our brother in saudi arabia we want our brother in saudi arabia to have a voic in the west to be heard to have a stand and abl to threaten with gasolin and their deposit in the unit state western countri and the compani that work there and make thousand of billion in profit passag omit in thi time of revolutionari islam awaken thi reviv in libya thi renaiss thi return of awar the set up of the shura the commun system in the religi sens thi humbug and thi nonsens by the islamist ha no place here amazingli after zionism carri out these massacr hebron massacr thei want to reward it by lift the econom boycott against it and yesterdai franc

god is great oh ye salut to the inhabit of derna correct himself to the inhabit of tobruk passag omit franc also even refus to solv it problem with libya over it aircraft in solidar with america and britain it said that we word indistinct solv our problem with libya in solidar with our brother the american and the english yesterdai thei reach a militari agreement with the isra to support them

our soldier we must bear in mind that thi countri is inhabit by 300 000 russian the threat of muslim fundament also worri uzbekistan and other center asian state therefor cooper is both in the interest of our countri as well as these state malik what about your troop in armenia azerbaijan kashlev we do not have ani combat unit there thei ar fight against each other we want un peacekeep unit to be sent there pleas rememb that we must put out the fire on our southern border thi is the onli thing in which we ar interest we have no imperi ambit malik what is the role of russia todai kashlev russia is a larg countri howev the most import task of the state and the govern is to rebuild the economi unless we do thi the govern will be obliter from the face of the earth the solidar demonstr in warsaw stretch 5 km our will extend as mani as 500 km can you imagin that we would realli like to deal onli with the economi todai we ar interest in develop abroad just as much as is necessari we do not want the conflict in the caucasu or tajikistan to spread to us in russia there ar million of tatar bashkir and peopl of other nation we do not want to experi the yugoslav conflict on our soil these ar the onli thing that we ar worri about foreign polici is subordin to our intern goal malik howev bill clinton s america want russia as a superpow doe it not kashlev russia is a superpow that is an object fact as far as our militari potenti is concern it equal the american potenti as for natur resourc russia come first russia is the largest countri on earth no on is go to take these advantag awai from us washington ha understood that it cannot take on everyth we ar not a superpow becaus we ar go through a crisi howev we have a role to plai whoever forget thi and teas us doe the

try to block our reform and imped our fight against the crisi malik the role of russia is appreci todai howev moscow s opinion on mani issu ar differ will there not be a conflict with the west over the plan air strike against serb in bosnia kashlev russia s polici toward yugoslavia is noth new our view is differ all the war which in recent year resembl the yugoslav conflict such as the afghan and vietnam war were caus by the ignor of politician thei all start with small step with the intervent of unit and end up in the tragedi of entir armi on must know the histori on must know how to draw conclus if our gener had known about the defeat of the english in afghanistan thei would never have gone there if the american had paid proper attent to the experi of the french in vietnam thei would not have gone into the jungl the german did not manag to cope with the yugoslav guerrilla throughout all of world war ii do you think that the west will cope with the serb todai apart from that bomb in bosnia will be drop on innoc peopl as well the area is not the same as the hundr of kilomet of desert in kuwait or iraq where us and french soldier have recent fought thi is why russia can see the danger of an arm intervent in yugoslavia and fear that thi local conflict mai turn into a global on on war ha alreadi start in sarajevo malik i understand that russia ha it own view on thi issu howev why is it so that despit earlier enthusiasm for thi concept russia is not hurri to sign the partnership for peac kashlev we will not have a race we consid the partnership for peac to be the optimum solut todai for nato for you and for us it resolv the difficult problem of fill the vacuum left after the collaps of the communist system russia ha good relat with the unit state also in the militari area in juli larg scale russian american militari maneuv will take place our militari potenti just cannot be compar to the militari potenti of the central and east european state we realli have power at our dispos and thi is why the scale of our cooper with nato includ cooper in the militari sphere is differ if we want we will sign the partnership for peac program i emphas howev that we ar not

realist do you know how much monei you will need to adjust to the militari structur of nato malik from the point of view of not onli poland russian democraci is a great experi in the last elect reform were elect to the parliament howev almost on fourth of the voter support vladimir zhirinovskii who quit openli advertis the program of an imperi russia hi statement as well as the map that he draw upset a great mani peopl kashlev we cannot deni thi fact we realiz thi zhirinovskii wa support by peopl who were taken in by hi rhetor he attack quit clearli and simpli he did not spare ani sharp word he condemn the condit of the economi the crisi he promis that he would help the poor and the patient other politician did not sai such thing thei rather avoid ani critic thi is why zhirinovskii becam popular he won becaus he plai on the peopl s emot still 25 percent of the peopl support him which is quit a lot hi victori show the danger that russia might find itself in if peopl such as himself come to power i emphas howev that fortun for the time be hi word cannot be turn into action zhirinovskii ha no such possibl or such power malik thu we can evalu thi situat object and sai that zhirinovskii is plai into the hand of yeltsin kashlev you can sai that i suppos it ha gotten across to the world that russia must be help in overcom the econom crisi then there will be no such peopl as zhirinovskii howev do not forget that out of the sum of 40 billion we realli receiv onli a few billion all the time i can hear the same old thing russia must be help howev these ar onli word onli blah blah blah to ensur that russia will overcom the crisi thi must be done effici malik revert to the fear of pole and poland why do you think russia is todai perceiv as our adversari kashlev i understand pole fear there wa a time when czarist russia along with prussia and austria hungari caus the partit of poland poland had realli bad luck to have such neighbor as it had then for over 40 year the soviet fist hung over the world again you were unlucki to be closest to thi fist there were order from moscow thei sai that there wa also friendship between us the soviet union wa a militarist state it goal wa to build commun around the world fortun there is no longer a soviet union but a democrat russia i must sai that over the last three year a breakthrough wa made in our relat i am now refer to our polit contact econom relat ar not so good at all malik what do you think polish russian relat should be like now that both state have found themselv on the road of reform when

crisi surround the north korean nuclear issu ar endlessli be put forward in the stock market howev price ar actual rise as if ridicul these idea how ar the member of the nation assembl s nation defens committe accept these contradictori phenomena we got an answer to thi from democrat parti dp lawmak na pyong son a graduat of the 14th class of the korean militari academi repres na is an oper expert have pass through the posit of 1st armi oper and intellig staff offic armi headquart deputi director of oper joint chief of staff oper bureau director and 6th corp command to transfer to the reserv as a lieuten gener repres na is on of the newli elect lawmak to get the most attent from variou media for hi sharp question on nation defens polici dure thi regular session of the nation assembl kim an emerg meet wa held in the nation assembl nation defens committe last novemb in which kim tok director of the agenc for nation secur plan and defens minist kwon yong hae gave a situat report on dprk trend in your judgment how much of a danger is there of war on the korean peninsula na to begin with my conclus it is not easi for condit to develop that would lead to an outbreak of war on the korean peninsula when view geopolit the influenc of the surround four great power is absolut that is to sai neither the north nor the south can attack the other by the will of it own govern alon also nation power and the circumst surround the korean peninsula ar now complet the revers of those at the time of the korean war kim but senior us offici and foreign new agenc continu to speak of crisi na there ar two extern factor that could support the dprk on is forc give ideolog support that is the communist bloc but it collaps the other is forc give econom support that is alli of the dprk but the dprk cannot depend on them either intern the most import factor enabl a nation to wage war ar militari and econom power howev at the time of the korean war south korea rok wa not onli inferior militarili but even in econom power wa far behind the dprk with factori oper rate below 40 percent dprk econom growth is unlik the scale of it gnp is on sixth that of the rok in the case of militari power at the time of the korean war when rok forc were less than 100 000 dprk forc were over 200 000 in tank and gun the dprk held absolut superior but thing ar differ now on thing that must be consid howev is that the dprk continu to build up it militari although there mai be critic of it qualiti the gener analysi is that the dprk militari ha numer superior howev unlik the start of the korean war which saw no us troop in korea now thei ar here by a strengthen secur treati base on the rok us mutual defens treati thu the combin forc of the us militari station in korea and the korean militari ar a suffici deterr to war kim howev quot secret us defens depart document or senior offici foreign new agenc ar report veri believ war scenario na concern about an invas of the south or scenario predict short term occup of seoul report by the media ar onli hypothet thei have almost no valid accord to the situat report it economi is so bad recent that the dprk is carri out a campaign to eat two meal a dai thi is intertwin with problem of the preserv of the regim and the transfer of power it know that wage war cannot be a wai to preserv it system a war with no chanc of win cannot but lead directli to it collaps link the possibl of war with the nuclear issu despit thi while back the dprk into a corner the american media ar sai that if the dprk is back into a corner there is a chanc of war break out thi actual give on the feel that thei ar incit thi thi is an erron and danger logic kim it is report that in two recent survei question whether there should be militari sanction against the dprk concern it nuclear program over half of american support sanction do you believ there is some special background to these survei and report na thi come mostli from the linkag of us interest with the nuclear issu the prevent of nuclear prolifer ha been a consist us strategi for world domin and wa a clinton campaign promis the us defens depart recent announc that it set up the defens nuclear prolifer prevent plan dci the nuclear non prolifer treati npt expir in june 1995 then it will have to be extend or conclud again the disappear of the npt would be a decis disadvantag for us world strategi if it cannot block dprk nuclear develop the npt will definit come apart thu for the unit state dprk nuclear develop must be stop no matter what thu my perspect is that the unit state mai be come out with these theori of immin invas of the south as a mean to pressur dprk and thi is also us to pressur rok it is for stress that the problem cannot be solv by appeas dprk when the rok govern take an appeas attitud or appear to do so kim thi is a veri import analysi do you have ground to prove it na it is my understand that even when the elderli yi in mo wa return to the north the unit state oppos thi with the reform drive polici which came press in after the birth of the new administr as polici toward dprk includ the nuclear issu began to flow somewhat in the direct of appeas and chang the unit state appear to have had misgiv that if thing continu as thei were korea would head in a nationalist direct thu it appear to come from idea of give these action a declar signific with even concern over korean nation in mind otherwis given variou condit such as the end of the cold war the disappear of forc support the dprk and the dprk worsen economi how could the unit state haphazardli talk about a dprk invas henc the talk of an invas of the south and the heighten sens of crisi flow out of the unit state appear to be strateg move target both the rok and the dprk nuclear issu the wai i see it although the dprk mai do it if it assum the collaps of it govern there is no possibl of it start a full scale war which would definit be suicid howev on thing i m worri about is a limit war consid it capabl for a protract war it is imposs for the dprk to commun the rok if the korean us allianc is put into action sinc seoul is close howev the dprk doe have the offens capabl to do consider damag to the capit in a short time the dprk ha larg quantiti of chemic and biolog weapon combin with artilleri in rang of seoul thi mean that it is possibl the dprk could break part of seoul s defens line even if it wouldn t be an all out war of cours i m sai thi militarili under the assumpt the north would launch a surpris attack and would risk the collaps of it regim to do thi kim then is there no possibl that the theori about a possibl dprk invas stori of crisi and the opinion poll on sanction against the dprk present by the unit state ar not onli for pressur north and south korea to solv the nuclear issu but that thei also have us militari sanction in mind na well we can t realli draw a conclus on that right howev the industri have the greatest difficulti in the unit state is the defens industri enorm defens industri ar downsiz now becaus war or the threat of war vanish with the end of the cold war foreign demand for weapon is diminish the rok is the us weapon industri s greatest asian custom from it veri begin the korean militari wa found accord to the organiz equip chart of the us militari but begin in the late 1980 s in the cours of finish with convent weapon and go to high tech weapon korea move awai from be pro american in it equip and is becom multilater in it weapon purchas our submarin ar from germani for our destroy we make the hull themselv but the other equip is from the unit kingdom or germani for helicopt which have becom veri import in modern warfar we ar present us american made equip but if someth better and cheaper come out there is no need to purpos continu us it the us defens industri is hard press right now furthermor russian weapon ar come out at rock bottom price the creation of the present sens of crisi about the dprk is not unrel to the circumst of the us defens industri kim do you have actual evid reflect pressur by the us militari industri complex na i have no tangibl evid howev it is a fact that thei ar express dissatisfact with korea s multilater of it weapon purchas thei did so thi last time when we import submarin and destroy up to now weapon purchas have alwai follow the spread of theori of crisi on the korean peninsula also these crisi stori gener come about the time korea s nation defens budget is be pass kim in novemb in an unpreced move the us defens depart publish it 1993 unit state forc korea usfk inspect report central to the report were the claim that rok us combin forc were unprepar for an emerg and the suggest that a wartim support forc oper plan should be set up never befor publish becaus it wa classifi secret what is behind the public of thi inspect report na that is an import point it is in the same context as i mention befor there is no such thing as a perfect wartim support plan if examin from a pure militari perspect everi countri ha weak the us defens depart s inspect report is done not just onc but everi year and thi is not the onli year prepar have been found to be unsatisfactori thi wa the case last year too and the year befor that the wai i see it thi is the inadequaci in connect with the wartim support plan in last year s annual korea us secur consult meet a switch wa made to a new strateg concept call the flexibl deterr option fdo in actual howev the wartim support plan itself includ in the rok us combin forc command cfc oper plan oplan 5027 is arrang in such a wai as to requir a consider amount of time dprk strategi howev emphas short term conflict and blitzkrieg the support plan is lax compar with thi the problem howev is that it didn t becom lax just thi year the problem ha alwai been point out kim the focu of the inspect appear to be whether the wartim host nation support agreement whn conclud in novemb 1991 would be observ na the wartim logist support agreement is present be carri out a littl at a time gener an agreement is the reinforc and observ of a secur treati therefor everi year when the korea us secur consult meet is held progress on thi is suppos to be check and further so i cannot help but view these statement that prepar ar inadequ and that the rok would fall in the event of war made in spite of the great progress which ha been made compar with the past as mean for pressur north and south korea under the premis of a crisi situat kim some point out that there ar problem in the makeup of and cooper on the fdo packag na the fdo concept wa adopt as the new world strategi of the unit state after clinton came on board the concept is on step more develop than the wartim support plan of the past in the past if a war broke out the commit of combat forc wa suppos to be time with the respons stage with fdo howev thi ha chang forc ar to be sent to deter war thi mean that thei ar alreadi come at the stage in which a war crisi situat is form that is to sai let s prevent a war by put forc in place in the case of fdo it is my understand that the work is in progress of actual form them and includ them in the present oper plan but detail ar secret i can point out thi howev in the annual korea us secur consult meet held in novemb it wa agre that dure wartim the seventh fleet would be put under cfc oper control then thi too must be includ in the cfc oper plan of cours thi work ha not yet been complet of the attach of the seventh fleet thei sai it guarante automat wartim intervent but if war should break out at the same time in the indian ocean or the middl east we cannot know whether thei will actual interven on the korean peninsula i question whether there is a need to irrit the dprk by publicli announc and stress the cfc attach of the seventh fleet it is actual of more strateg benefit to keep thi secret between korea and the unit state thi put thing the other wai around thi kind of unnecessari public statement is tell the korean militari not to increas it naval forc concern the dprk it is wrong in that it can be interpret just as the dprk claim as a threat of nuclear blackmail kim accord to the washington post the us secretari of defens report to presid clinton on an emerg defens plan base on usfk 5027 what is the basic concept of the cfc oper plan oplan 5027 na gener when new tactic or strategi is develop it is reflect in oper plan after pass through the process of map exercis and actual maneuv train the blind spot of the cfc oper plan is that the cfc is not suppos to make a first strike our free world alli gener adopt a strateg concept of not launch a first strike howev becaus in accord with our armistic agreement the guilti parti is determin by who fire first the oper plan is set up to observ the armistic agreement howev surpris attack and first strike ar absolut essenti in war first strike mean that in war the attack side ha the choic of time and place thu the side suffer a first strike is at an absolut disadvantag particularli earli in the war supplement thi disadvantag condit is the air land battl concept develop by the us armi in the earli 1980 s thi wa a develop of oper and strateg idea follow the chang of it weapon system to a form suit for three dimension warfar thi approach is possibl assum intellig destruct power and maneuver when thi rapid deploy maneuv forc system is in place a deep strike strategi becom possibl wherebi when an oppon make a first strike hi main axi of attack is block while anoth axi maneuv strike the enemi s rear kim thi strateg concept ultim signifi a fluid offens defens postur that when the dprk ha made a first strike would move the main line of battl to the north when wa thi includ in the cfc oplan 5027 na let s sai the mid 1980 s although not as good as a first strike it keep the spirit of the un armistic agreement and is a strategi which supplement strike power against an oppon s attack i think it is probabl the best strateg concept possibl under the present un armistic agreement system kim consid the dprk nuclear issu i have misgiv regardless of whether thei have nuclear weapon the bush administr withdrew usfk nuclear weapon ha thi been reflect in the cfc oplan na it is my understand that plan for the us of nuclear weapon were drop from the oplan after the withdraw of usfk nuclear weapon howev as long the korea us combin forc system exist there is no possibl of war break out on the korean peninsula kim as a legisl who is former militari you seem to have a particularli progress perspect toward the unit state thi is a sharp question repres kang chang song im pok chin and yourself ar call the three musket of the nation defens committe of those still on activ duti in the militari is there anyon with thought similar to your own na for those at the ministri of nation defens directli respons for the work of nation defens it is natur that thei would concentr on the war deterr capabl of the militari if you talk with them howev there ar mani particularli of those respons for nation defens polici who think the same wai i do but thei cannot speak of thi outright ultim it is the politician who must indic thi so i m speak on their behalf time ar now chang we ar move into an era in which even a superpow such as the unit state cannot guarante it secur with it own power alon howev we must continu develop nation defens polici in a direct that would enabl us with onli our nation s resourc to have at least a minimum of deterr capabl thi is becaus if we have noth we have no

like to ask you about the issu of north korea s suspect nuclear arm develop which wa explain in the video we just saw ichiro ozawa said earlier in thi program that north korea possess nuclear weapon what do you think hata there ar three suspicion regard the north korean nuclear issu first that it is plan to make nuclear weapon second that it ha tri befor to make nuclear weapon or third it alreadi ha on or two atom bomb in it possess which ar the same size as those drop on hiroshina and nagasaki amid such suspicion the intern atom energi agenc iaea ha begun inspect of north korea s nuclear facil it wa difficult to persuad north korea to accept inspect of the seven facil includ in the list thei submit the iaea ha begun the inspect thank to persist negoti by the unit state howev the inspect have onli just begun their outcom is yet to be determin also we ar still face with the issu of inspect the other two facil not includ on the list the unit state ha been sai it will not conduct the team spirit joint militari exercis if north korea accept the inspect follow by discuss between the north and south actual south korea propos call off the exercis and the unit state accept under such circumst the iaea ha begun it inspect the intern commun is still worri about the other two facil and is wonder whether or not the current inspect of the seven facil will be carri out thoroughli kuroiwa as foreign minist what do you think about all thi do you think north korea ha nuclear weapon hata well under the current circumst i would like to refrain from comment on whether or not north korea possess nuclear weapon kuroiwa what will be the basi of your decisionmak what kind of inform ar you go to us to determin whether or not north korea possess nuclear weapon will it be inform provid by the unit state hata the iaea is conduct it inspect as an offici organ of the intern commun we will make our decis on the basi of the outcom of those inspect of cours we will also obtain inform from the unit state china and other countri not to mention the rok matsuyama as we discuss earlier inspect will not be carri out thi time on the other two facil as we saw in the video mani feel the effect of the current inspect will be minim in thi regard we receiv answer to our question from the gener associ of korean resid in japan chongnyon accord to them the two facil ar militari base chongnyon add that ani claim about the two site be nuclear facil is intention foster suspicion thei feel the possibl exist that all other north korean militari facil will be strip of their veil if inspect of these two facil ar accept therefor north korea refus to accept inspect of the two facil what do you think of thi respons hata of cours thi wa discuss between the unit state and the rok howev the inspect of the seven facil which ar includ on the list will give us some idea of whether or not the materi requir for make nuclear bomb wa remov therefor the unit state and the rok agre to inspect these facil first moreov thei also agre to call off the team spirit exercis the inspect have just begun on the basi of the outcom of the inspect the unit state and the dprk will hold discuss again thei ar schedul to hold the third meet on 21 march we will make our decis on the basi of these procedur takemura it is regrett that japan cannot take the leadership thi is an extrem import issu for japan nevertheless japan ha to reli on the unit state after all as i recal former presid reagan took a veri strong stanc toward the soviet union about ten year ago the soviet union deploi it ss 20 medium rang missil in respons the unit state decid to deploi medium rang missil in europ presid reagan maintain thi hard stanc for a long time the strategi work well and final the soviet union gave up the arm race in 1985 and gorbachev eventu dismantl the soviet union it would be nice if north korea gave in like the soviet union did howev the case of the soviet union and north korea ar quit differ the unit state is not take ani aggress attitud toward north korea for the fear north korea mai go haywir howev american newspap ar sai presid clinton is a man of indecis or is weak in comparison to former presid reagan i wonder what kind of attitud the japanes foreign ministri will adopt if presid clinton begin to take a strong stanc as reagan did hata in the meet with mr clinton or in my talk with the us secretari of defens we said that even though inspect had not start negoti were still underwai to that end and so it wa best not to do anyth that would incit north korea as a matter of principl if the dprk decid to reject inspect or to us it negoti posit in a strang wai japan should do what it can under it constitut takemura we all know there ar big limit under the constitut besid if north korea becom will to start war it nuclear warhead cannot be sent as far as the unit state becaus it doe not have the missil to carri them that far it missil can though reach japan and south korea that is what is decis differ from the situat that exist at the time of tension between europ and the soviet union ar we prepar to face thi situat though kobayashi thi is no ordinari situat for japan if north korea continu to reject inspect of two other facil there is the possibl of us dprk negoti break down hata it is not just the us dprk negoti that ar jeopard the whole intern commun is veri much concern onc north korea is permit to get awai with it the mani other nation which want nuclear arm of their own will do the same as such the intern commun is veri wari in other word everyon is watch patient kobayashi as far as the possibl of us dprk negoti break down is concern ms hisahiko okab said a rift in the talk could come as earli as april as far as japan is concern there is no other choic but to wait and see what will happen in us drpk negoti is that right hata we ar not exactli wait onli for the outcom of the us dprk negoti as the iaea is now conduct inspect it is onli natur japan should consid it next move after monitor the progress of the inspect howev we must rememb that japan s constitut tell us what the countri can and cannot do so we ourselv know along what guidelin we can act and we can tell other as well matsuyama pleas look at thi video footag video show prime minist hosokawa at a post us japan summit new confer sai japan will do what it can if the un secur council adopt econom sanction against north korea other peopl speak about pyongyang s foreign monei sourc kuroiwa north korea think enforc econom sanction is tantamount to declar a war thi mean that if japan particip in econom sanction japan will be parti to declar a state of war right hata north korea did make a remark like that kuroiwa will japan despit thi statement turn it promis into action hata it is the north korean who made that statement if it decid to enforc sanction and we ar ask to cooper then we must plai our part kuroiwa prime minist hosokawa said clearli that japan would cooper if the unit nation ask countri to take econom sanction against the dprk but such action might be taken suddenli so ha the matter been discuss within the govern and rule coalit parti hata doe japan which ha for so long talk about the import of the unit nation in world affair and about the import of un center diplomaci want to hear the charg that it ha run awai from it respons when the time to plai it part come abov all thi is a matter that concern it closest neighbor countri japan cannot do that that is why prime minist hosokawa said japan will act within the limit allow under the constitut kuroiwa so if it is decid to adopt econom sanction japan will cooper hata thi whole matter is continu i do not think it appropri to discuss it when inspect of the north korean nuclear facil have just start takemura there is noth wrong with mr kuroiwa want to pursu thi matter in depth thi is differ from a question such as whether or not sakigak harbing and the japan new parti will merg that kind of thing realli doe not mean much but the topic of north korea concern the live of our peopl and i think everyon watch thi program ha a keen interest in it i believ televis program should take thi topic serious so i am pleas it is on of the topic for discuss todai other countri see that although thi is an issu about which the japanes peopl should be most concern thei do not seem to show much interest about it that is what a foreign newspap wrote half in deris i want everyon to be awar of thi mr hata wa almost late for the program he is busi everi dai but ha he been busi with the north korean issu he ha been occupi by the cabinet reshuffl and other worthless thing hata i have been busi but not as you have describ there ar thing that cannot be made public like inform on sentenc incomplet as takemura interrupt takemura interrupt foreign minist hata you ar the number on man on thi question i certainli hope you will deal with it it is i think the first most seriou crisi japan ha face in the 50 year sinc the end of world war ii it is about the countri which li right next to us matsuyama there is anoth thing that worri us will you pleas show that video mr nakamura thi is a report carri by the mainichi daili new late last year accord to thi mr hata said he had heard that the cabinet inform research offic estim the amount of monei sent to north korea from japan amount to almost 200 billion yen a year hata the cabinet inform research offic said that i think there is someth wrong here i have never said anyth of the kind matsuyama well that is the wai the report wa written and we have obtain a comment from the gener associ of korean resid in japan chongnyon on the subject it said that claim of figur as high as ten or hundr of billion of yen ar without foundat what do you have to sai about that hata what i want to sai is that variou sourc of inform alleg that larg amount of monei have flow into north korea from japan some of them make refer to ten or hundr of billion of yen some sai the monei ha been carri by travel in person or in their luggag or ha been sent via hong kong or china while there ha been much talk about the matter to our regret we have not been abl to accur assess the amount involv matsuyama is the govern do anyth to discov how much is involv hata even though there ar no diplomat relat between japan and north korea we have to consid human right and those peopl whose fatherland is north korea or who were born there kuroiwa as katsumi sato said earlier as long as these peopl cannot be stop from reenter japan the monei flow cannot be stem hata i am talk onli in term of gener principl kuroiwa the problem of monei transfer will remain to be tackl in the futur hata north korea is at present isol be isol mean that there is no inform come out of there besid the countri ha a veri strong power structur and the nation can be move easili by it leader the countri ha a veri strong power structur but is danger it is for thi reason i have been sai it is veri import that the peopl of north korea join the intern commun or that an atmospher can be creat in which true dialogu can be held kuroiwa i never meant to pose the question out of unnecessari fear i present the question in the belief that issu relat to secur and diplomaci should be dealt with on the assumpt that the wors could happen maysuyama now we would like to ask you about relat between japan and the unit state but first we must beg your pardon for sai earlier that you came late becaus of your tight schedul it wa due to our failur to contact you and confirm arrang we ar veri sorri laughter kuroiwa we would like to have your comment on japan us relat when you consid the dprk issu you onc again recogn the import of japan us relat we feel the controversi super 301 provis of the 1988 omnibu trade act strongli suggest japan is be threaten howev now that tokyo ha declar japan us relat have matur we believ japan will not yield to us threat and make concess what ar your view hata the fact is that mr clinton ha state sinc the presidenti elect campaign that he would reviv the super 301 provis there were mani argument about the wisdom of thi befor the recent negoti start some said it wa inevit that the unit state would have to reviv it i think by show it intent to reviv the super 301 the unit state is urg japan to give matter seriou consider we have no intent howev of hold negoti under threat of the super 301 provis in recent gatt talk we reach an agreement on the need to hold multilater negoti moreov a new trade bodi the world trade organ wto is to be creat it ha been agre that disput should not be settl through bilater talk but through multilater talk and that procedur for settl disput should be taken more quickli and more fulli than befor i deepli regret that under such circumst the us govern ha announc it is to reviv the super 301 provis which will enabl it to take unilater action in bilater talk i am not sai thi becaus it happen to concern japan takemura i understand the foreign minist is in a difficult posit the govern is inevit urg to take a hard line stanc hata ye ye takemura jutaro komura a meiji era diplomat wa almost assassin for sign the portsmouth treati after the 1904 japan russia war and foreign minist yosuk matsuoka declar japan wa withdraw from the leagu of nation by sai japan will leav sayonara sayonara at the time the japanes peopl applaud loudli hata that is right the peopl applaud him takemura if mr matsuoka had been weak and yield to the demand of other nation he would have been sever critic on hi return to japan with that in mind i am concern that japanes politician includ mr hata will think that hard line remark ar smart and becom increasingli aggress in their comment the other dai i told the stori of how carthag wa destroi by rome when carthag s negoti return from the last negoti in rome the peopl of carthag blame them for be weak and kill them then the peopl rose up and the ancient nation wa destroi i hope thi will not hata interrupt what mr takemura said now is veri import the fact is dure talk between me and mr kantor he said mr hata the unit state ha experienc mani breakdown in trade talk with european nation and canada he also said although it is regrett we mai need a break in the trade talk for a while becaus we ar have difficulti reach agreement on even basic point at that time i told mr kantor the stori you told now and i told him that it wa such bitter experi in japan that led to world war ii in which japan caus much troubl i also told him bear histori in mind i find it a shame that the trade talk which have almost been conclud ar be broken off onli becaus of an argument about the result mr kantor and i were discuss thi until earli in the morn of that dai after the talk end then i summon repres from each ministri and agenc to tell them thei should not be optimist i said despit the breakdown of the talk the point at issu in the talk is that japan ha a 60 billion trade surplu with the unit state and it is natur that the unit state is irrit by that i ad in that sens we should voluntarili tackl thi issu immedi after we return to japan i later brief a cabinet meet takemura in that case it is veri good that mr toyoda toyota motor corpor chief and due to becom chairman of keidanren feder of econom organ of japan recent said that toyota nissan motor co and mitsubishi motor corpor need to voluntarili cut export the govern cannot sai that so mr toyoda s announc wa veri nice it is also good that mr toyoda is to becom the next keidanren chairman becaus he is the chief of a lead automak and will now becom the most respons person in the econom sector kuroiwa i think the time of thi announc wa possibl a littl too good voluntari action by toyota and ido or nippon idou tsushin corp ar all veri well but i suspect that behind the scene the ministri of intern trade and industri or somebodi els issu administr instruct to them and thei arrang not to contradict each other i can see such a conspiraci hata thi is not true the matur of relat between japan and the unit state ha been mention but japanes economist and the gener public ar adopt a matur outlook thei were not cow by the threaten reviv of the super 301 but thei also recogn that japan s trade surplu is too big on or two dai after i return to japan from the unit state i met by chanc the keidanren leader at a hotel he said mr hata i think we have to voluntarili do what we must to deal with thi issu we clearli understand that kobayashi some peopl stress japan must not make concess to the unit state i think the worst aspect of bilater negoti is that it caus agit in both countri as mr kantor ha recent urg japan to bui more motorola phone i person feel that question ti among polit busi and bureaucrat circl ar even stronger in the unit state but it is not an appropri opportun to rais the question the unit state will have off year elect thi fall and preliminari elect campaign have alreadi start in some state in a wai the unit state is overreact to the trade issu as part of an elect campaign in such circumst the situat mai becom wors if japan react emotion to us move so i would like to ask mr foreign minist what we should do to settl the issu on auto trade for exampl japan s possibl choic ar to cut export to narrow the export import gap or to further liber the japanes market and so continu to sell japanes car without caus trade friction which do wai would you take hata pleas let me sai on thing about that as professor kobayashi just note it seem the negoti were becom a verbal war when i had talk with mr kantor moreov thei ar becom media war in the sens that the mass media of both countri stoke public frustrat on thi issu through agit sinc these ar make the bilater relat even wors we must take correct action somehow as far as japan s cours of action is concern on of the rule of thumb is that the japanes privat sector should voluntarili settl it own problem auto and auto part import for exampl in thi field it is import to seek balanc expans of auto trade between japan and the unit state rather than cut export from on side anoth point is in such area as govern procur and insur import ar disturb by japanes govern regul in these area the govern must posit promot deregul kuroiwa to settl the econom framework talk you have been sai that it mai be possibl for japan to accept numer target relat to such macroeconom field as gross nation product gnp instead of those on individu sector do you intend to formal propos thi to prime minist hosokawa hata the numer target issu ha been the biggest point of conflict in the negoti and the unit state said it would impos econom sanction if the framework talk bore no fruit but it is not what mr kantor realli want similarli both side did not want to worsen bilater ti through the talk in such a case it is veri import for japan to posit improv the current situat also japan should expand it domest market through promot of a deregul polici when better foreign made product becom avail at cheaper price it will enrich the livelihood of consum we must focu on that point rather than unwillingli respond to foreign pressur kuroiwa now we would like to question mr hata as the leader of shinseito japan renew parti prime minist hosokawa said it wa hi decis not to reshuffl the cabinet and not the result of pressur from somebodi els obvious he could not do so i think the issu clarifi discord in the coalit govern do you think the coalit parti can maintain their uniti now hata on the dai the prime minist made that announc i said we should go back to the start point when the coalit govern wa form last august i also said we should remind ourselv that the most import point is that we ar the on who have chang the polit framework of the last 38 year when i said thi everybodi look reliev and i felt we were readi to restart everi coalit parti chairman and secretari gener wa there matsuyama yet when we recent had komeito secretari gener ichikawa as a guest he accus chief cabinet secretari takemura of behav like a second prime minist and mr ozawa ha been urg that mr takemura be fire it seem to me their feel against mr takemura were at the heart of the problem takemura in a recent televis interview mr takemura said he wa in a difficult posit sai there wa noth to be gain by discuss the matter yet again becaus it would onli make thing wors in fact howev it wa an awkward question on newspap later carri a weird report that i wa go to replac mr takemura but that is nonsens my opinion is that the chief cabinet secretari should serv as the closest associ the prime minist and as the spokesman he or she should speak out on behalf of the prime minist on the other hand a parti head should repres the view of hi or her parti it is veri difficult to reconcil the two conflict posit in thi sens i said it would be difficult for mr takemura to fulfil hi duti under the current circumst thi ha noth to do with hi person capabl on those ground howev everyon concern includ mr takemura agre to let him restart and he said he would pai more attent to the intent of the prime minist matsuyama do you mean it is difficult for parti head to serv as chief cabinet secretari hata ye it is difficult but he acknowledg the difficulti and all of us had discuss that he is go to start again on those ground so i think he is readi to fulfil the duti of chief cabinet secretari kuroiwa do you mean he feel sorri about hi past behavior hata it is not like that when he wa appoint as chief cabinet secretari there wa nobodi els to fill the posit matsuyama it is said mr ozawa went underground in protest against the prime minist s decis is he angri now hata i do not think so i talk with him on the phone yesterdai matsuyama did you talk about the issu hata no we did not sinc we enact polit reform and the new elect system we talk about our futur cours of action kuroiwa in connect with thi prime minist hosokawa said the cabinet reshuffl is need to organ the administr to grappl with econom reform but he gave up the cabinet reshuffl then what would happen to econom reform hata it appear mr hosokawa plan to provid a new cabinet lineup with more stress on econom reform yet as seen in the govern s deregul effort econom reform ha alreadi start mr hosokawa actual want a new lineup but i think the current cabinet is good enough kuroiwa the current cabinet wa design as a polit reform cabinet and it ha a minist in charg of polit reform so we expect someth new in the lineup for econom reform hata concern polit reform we onli revis the elector and fiscal control system for the lower hous we must work next on upper hous reform we should reorgan the polit parti under the new polit reform law and reform the entir diet so polit reform ha not yet end we have just taken the first step kuroiwa yet the next largest subject for japan s polit is econom reform so i have a propos the cabinet reshuffl will take place sooner or later probabl after the enact of the fiscal 1994 budget in mai or june at that time i think mr ichiro ozawa is suppos to plai posit role as the shinseito head what is your opinion of us mr ozawa in the cabinet hata i have been tell him he should plai posit role but there ar some problem too our parti is organ with onli 62 diet member but current plai the lead role in the coalit govern sinc we ar the most experienc group in the coalit therefor we ar expect to locat capabl peopl both in the parti and the cabinet the shinseito is occupi five seat in the cabinet under such circumst i think it is imposs for both of us to be cabinet member but hi particip in the cabinet mai be possibl when i return to the parti when the occas demand it matsuyama do you mean mr ozawa mai join the cabinet when the occas demand it hata i think that is possibl kuroiwa you mean either you or mr ozawa should take charg of the parti don t you hata right but mr ozawa alwai sai he prefer parti manag kobayashi in connect with the import of the parti you have just mention a sensit point what did you mean by reorgan of parti under the polit reform law under the singl seat constitu system it is imposs for the coalit parti to beat the liber democrat parti ldp if thei deal separ with elect doe reorgan of parti under the polit reform law mean format of parti merger among the coalit parti hata in a sens polit parti have been bodi for politician we ar try to creat genuin mass parti for the peopl thi principl should be implement even in local polit and polit parti must be organ which accept ordinari citizen take into account the next elect and the futur of japanes polit it is also import to think about the merger of such reform parti both ozawa and i believ a strong parti is need to cope with the ldp or we would be smash by them if we allow the reviv of the 38 year rule by the ldp again genuin chang will never happen in japan s polit takemura the presenc of the japan new parti jnp is veri weak becaus no bigshot is left in the parti rule parti should keep some promin leader in parti organ hata i agre with you the individu diet member of the jnp ar veri capabl peopl but few of them have the experi to manag polit affair i think thi is big troubl for mr hosokawa matsuyama our time is up now thi program is pose on question to all our guest in your opinion how great is the probabl of anoth polit parti realign within thi year hata i think the probabl of that take place is about 60 percent mayb a littl higher kuroiwa you have been nicknam mr polit reform now that the issu ha been settl for the time be could you tell me your new catch phrase hata that would be to aim at genuin polit sinc we start work on polit reform we have been sai that anoth parti realign will certainli take place after the enact of the polit reform bill or polit circl would fail to catch up with the dynam of polit matsuyama what about your attitud toward be mr hosokawa s successor hata laugh that is anoth stori kuroiwa i see thank you veri much for join us todai as the foreign minist the deputi prime minist and the parti head you gave us answer to variou question given the sever circumst surround japan i think we have to try our best not to send our children to the battlefield hata interrupt absolut right kuroiwa so we must have an ey on develop in polit circl thank you again

the same time even as a minist i held consult sometim i did not accept the advic howev thi is not typic as we ar awar accord to the hungarian constitut rule the prime minist ha a particular posit nevertheless the govern is work independ peopl who ar capabl of decis make ar work in thi govern it is a bad decis make system if someon want to have author in issu that ar not hi busi i have alwai been veri care to avoid thi the person or the area that is author in the particular case should alwai make the decis it follow that i do not usual discredit ministeri decis undoubtedli some decis have to be made by the prime minist but i make sure that the govern oper as a bodi natur in addit to thi i fulfil the function that the constitut assign to the prime minist szendrei in the past year the life of the coalit leader mdf ha been upset by intern fight mani time we have also seen resign can the parti continu to weaken or can you be sure that uniti will be establish boross i can sai with a clear conscienc that it is unnecessari to expect further conflict within the mdf we have pass a period in which we have been strengthen and our uniti ha been establish the speed and the system of the nomin for the prime ministeri posit also show thi with the segreg of the hungarian justic and life parti miep the mdf ha been freed from fruitless and often emotion motiv debat separ is alwai pain but it can onli be advantag if it is unavoid the line have been clear with the establish of the miep among other thing it can be seen that the mdf is not ident to the parti that wa shown often provoc even befor the intern public by the parti s minor now we have a clear situat there is an miep and an mdf the mdf ha freed itself from the situat where variou statement cast a shadow over it after the nomin which wa done in a veri definit and democrat framework everyon acknowledg the vote the main speaker of the parti that had separ from us actual announc in front of parliament that he to a consider extent agre with the opinion of the opposit allianc of free democrat szdsz and the feder of young democrat fidesz on the issu of the nomin these kind of statement were made by istvan csurka therefor it is not surpris that i wa unabl to win hi vote thi is how the situat is clear we ar no longer forc to work togeth in disharmoni try to hide the differ of view we have come to the end of a natur process we now have order in the mdf but the leadership never demand automat unifi think and action from the membership elect ar not a joust szendrei in the letkerdesek vital issu program on televis you mention that demagogi might also plai a signific role in the elect how big is the danger that the miep us demagogi will gain larg popular and push the elector to the right boross first of all in addit to the miep the other side is also prone to demagogi natur i hope that sober reason will character the campaign at the same time we can sadli expect the danger of demagogi i again emphas also from the left gener it is difficult to draw the line between demagogi and irrespons promis i hope that these element will not domin the elect prepar thi also depend on to what extent the hungarian public accept high sound fals slogan i dare not make predict howev i can certainli sai that demagogi and overtli extrem campaign have never been success in hungari it is imposs to win more than 10 percent of the vote thi wai the vast major of our citizen ar perfectli awar of the valu of loud voic szendrei mani thing have been coordin and even a code of ethic ha been drawn up in your view what is need to keep the elect clean correct and easi to overview boross politician and the print press that is influenc by polit group will have a vast role in thi gener the press in hungari is independ but we know how thi is to be interpret if honest self moder prevail then we will not be the on to spoil a better than expect atmospher in the elect campaign the consensu will be upset if certain newspap us a differ tone in spite of the gestur of the polit group that influenc them i would like to trust that their style can be brought closer togeth and i expect an honest competit although not a joust otherwis it will be hell on earth everyon ha list and file slander can be publish thi would make me veri disappoint i would not like to fight in an arena where mani particip do not adher to the rule of the game szendrei you also assign an import role to the press recent especi the televis and radio have been loud with skirmish in your progam you promis a quickli complet media law and settlement of the leadership issu in your view what kind of media should we have boross the world of commun ha great signific rememb that at the end of 1990 the chairman of the televis ban screen an interview with the prime minist i guess i need not prove how absurd thi is even thi could happen here thi is unpreced therefor we have to start from the premis that the radio and televis ar nation media the adject is not accident thei have to deal with univers issu that affect the countri and the nation and thei cannot be workshop for polem that ar inclin to be partisan the countri s affair have to be shown in the year follow 1990 the hungarian media did not strive to keep equal distanc on the contrari thei were character by some kind of anti govern bia thi wa coupl with the seriou financi interest of certain peopl i do not like these condit becaus these ar dishonest and unnatur secret interest ar hide behind these condit i especi do not like it when milit journalist bombard the tire citizen who wish to rest and entertain themselv with disput about the media s intern conflict these battl evok unnatur reaction therefor order ha to be establish good program have to be made and these have to be offer to the audienc in time everyon ha to be familiar with the basic element of disciplin in the public servic institut more poor more rich szendrei i believ that mani peopl ar much more interest in their own fate than in the media struggl accord to estim some 2 million peopl ar live below the subsist level the fate of the elect and of democraci could be decid becaus of the increas poverti boross it is irrespons to talk about gener impoverish statist have to be us carefulli the number do not distinguish between peopl live on 10 000 forint pension in villag where thei have a small garden or land and the old peopl in jozsefvaro budapest district the calcul prove to be veri superfici from the number i can even sens an intent to ideal the circumst of the 1980 s howev if we look at 10 year old newspap we can see that even thei were write about impoverish szendrei do you doubt that poverti in the countri ha increas in the past three year boross i and not try to avoid thi question we have to start from the premis that the process of the chang of ownership caus much upheav in hungari it ha to be admit that an offici select ha also been start and there ar inde more poor peopl but there ar also more rich peopl howev thi process of polar start as earli as in the 1960 s at that time though the newspap direct from the parti center did not write about rich peopl therefor ye we can see that there is a strata that is becom poor and we have to aid them from the state s welfar fund howev i do not think it like that we have to provid for 2 million peopl in my view we have to pai more attent through variou method to approxim 1 million peopl ill fate peopl will alwai exist howev we have to distinguish between these peopl too becaus in addit to the needi peopl who take the benefit to the pub also emerg thei cannot be lift out of their deviant lifestyl through financi support or action in my view in their case the initi of the local govern is us when thei give food and warm cloth to famili with mani children szendrei in addit to poor famili the govern and the countri ar also poor thi issu can be approach mani wai i will summar it in two word budget and state administr boross it cannot be deni that the budget deficit is depress thi can be reduc in a number of wai for exampl as it ha been done in some countri the live standard suddenli decreas while the deficit wa be reduc our societi would not have toler thi the problem of the state administr mainli appear on the revenu side natur i am not sai that the expenditur side should not be review howev let me add that those who cry out for the rapid reform of the big distribut system do not necessarili know what thei ar talk about from a state budget point of view the health servic can be made cheaper if the citizen pai more szendrei peopl have alreadi notic thi becaus for exampl the hospit cannot even alwai give the basic drug to the patient and their rel go to the pharmaci for the drug boross thi might be so or it might not be but the main point is that hospit oper without financi restrict for decad an adequ level of medic work can also be done with care financi manag the hungarian institut have to learn thi and i could alreadi now mention mani good exampl szendrei when the state administr expens ar critic it is often mention that state institut ar not frugal either boross i would like to hear thi gener critic in more concret term peopl who demand cheaper public administr might not even understand it profession compon in a squeez insid and outsid szendrei i know that thi is your pet topic boross it is inde becaus the establish of modern public administr wa on of the crucial element of our develop in the 19th centuri if someon want cheaper public administr he might be surpris when look at it budgetari detail some 65 percent of expenditur is on wage when can thi be reduc if we dismiss at least 20 000 public servic employe if someon want thi then he should come up

disciplin tax have to be paid in addit to establish more balanc budget condit thi also make it possibl to reduc the public duti and the payment oblig of entrepreneur i claim that the often mention levi rather than the tax ar the biggest problem for entrepreneur the 36 percent compani tax cannot be said to be high but the level of public due prevent increas employ the labor forc ha becom expens therefor the level of expens ha to be reduc when talk about increas the revenu we must not forget about the custom thi is not easi either hungarian custom control wa base on the transact of a few dozen export import compani in the market economi thi number increas 1 000 fold it take year for the custom author to establish an adequ infrastructur for the new task and for well train expert to work in thi field well train custom offic cannot be creat overnight howev an encourag process ha also begun in thi area the main point is that if the gross domest product increas as we can alreadi see

resolut must lead to the implement of paragraph 22 of resolut 687 and that the obstacl in thi regard is the us attitud thi fact wa clear on the intern level while we were in new york we were requir to continu to explain thing and abort the counterattack that start after march when the unit state and it lackei in the region found out that iraqi polit and diplomat activ had begun to produc result by chang the attitud insid the un secur council thei start a larg scale diplomat and non diplomat campaign for which thei mobil sever mean monei and bribe paid by the saudi and kuwaiti ruler and pressur and influenc by the unit state the american had to appear in public in thi instanc as you know christoph met with the minist of the gulf cooper council and warn them against rapproch with iraq becaus there wa some rapproch thi still exist on the part of certain state he warn them against such a rapproch and then did an unpreced thing he wrote an articl in the new york time in which he said the embargo against iraq should not be lift that the embargo should continu and so forth incident i will tell you thi as journalist i repli to that articl in an articl which i publish and then sent with a letter to an editor at the new york time we had to be there to answer question and strengthen the convict of the variou state in a posit direct we met with all member of the un secur council except the unit state i met with the four perman member the british the french the russian and the chines i met with some of them more than onc some of the meet were held jointli i also met with the other member of the council and with ambassador of other state that were not member of the secur council we had a lengthi discuss about the entir situat thei told us about their expect of the session thei said the unit state refus to acknowledg progress in implement the secur council resolut and is insist on that posit and britain will go along with thi posit therefor most like the council will not make ani decis mean there will be no new statement the trend is to not issu ani statement as wa the case in march inde the council met on 17 mai here i would like to reiter the follow fact first the state that took a posit posit in march have maintain and even improv their posit i read some remark from press sourc which i respect but i do not think thei ar awar of the fact these remark were made here and there and suggest some retreat in the posit of certain state there is no retreat in the posit of russia franc and china their posit is firm and it is even clearer than it wa in march becaus relat between the compet iraqi author on the on hand and the special commiss and the iaea on the other ar proceed veri well in a profession manner there ar no problem thi fact is known to all these state on my wai to new york i visit vienna and met with the iaea director gener who confirm these fact in a statement issu after the meet the reason that caus these state to chang their posit in march ar still valid in mai thei were even strengthen by the continu technic implement of the secur council resolut particularli section c of resolut 687 in march some state show posit sign appeas or support the posit of the three state that call for a chang in the mai meet the posit of these state wa clear exampl of these state ar spain brazil pakistan and nigeria as the russian ambassador who took the initi in thi meet told me we can now argu with the us side and demand that the statement be chang he also told me that i wa not alon in thi meet when i demand a chang eight member spoke with me in the march meet two other council member name new zealand and the czech republ show a neg attitud and did not talk in favor of a chang in thi meet howev the new zealand and czech member remain silent and made no statement dure our meet with the repres of these two countri thei show a good level of understand and acknowledg progress had been made thei howev did not commit themselv to announc thi in the council s meet for polit consider there is now a tangibl major of member state in the council that call for chang the statement s formula these state also acknowledg that progress wa achiev in implement the secur council resolut thei believ the econom blockad impos on iraq should be address by the council that the blockad should not be etern and should not last long thei also believ the iraqi peopl s suffer deserv attent and that the council should prove it credibl by fulfil it commit toward iraq in exchang for iraq s fulfil of it commit in accord with the council s resolut these state call for thi dure the council s deliber thei also call for thi in our bilater contact with them for your inform onli the us repres made a veri bad statement fill with falsehood and contradict both the languag she us and the present she made in the council s meet were not shown in the remark made by other repres even the british repres who join the us polit posit on not chang the statement s formula spoke in a languag somewhat differ from the us languag and could not deni progress had been achiev onli on countri name argentina cheapli and i must briefli describ it posit as a cheap on support the us posit in a wai that did not show a respect diplomat level thi is the posit of these three state two other countri remain silent and the major of the remain 10 countri show a posit attitud thu i consid that what happen in mai wa progress in the situat natur i cannot describ thi meet as a victori or sai that it realiz great achiev thi is becaus the achiev which we along with our peopl ar expect is to take tangibl step on the path to the lift of the blockad howev thi polit and diplomat process is veri complic and it is influenc by mani circumst and posit and need time and effort henc what happen in mai is consid progress on the path to lift or eas the blockad the level of both listen to and understand of the iraqi viewpoint on all issu whether regard the weapon the implement of section c of resolut 687 or other issu evok against iraq is much higher and deeper than ever befor as you know i visit new york twice in 1992 i travel there again in march 1993 to address the un secur council fifteen council member spoke ahead of me the repres of iraq mayb i had someth new to sai i made thi observ to the council presid i told him that ordinarili the guest should speak first but i have been accord a treatment incompat with the tradit of hospit and the meet and the statement that wa print and circul among the 15 member state befor the council began we us to meet with council member some of whom were not hostil or tendenti i mean thei listen and show some measur of sympathi but did not follow the drift of the argument quit serious we must credit the chang that took place in 1992 to iraq s steadfast in 1991 and 1992 thank to the us and western media and other media paid by the ruler of saudi arabia and kuwait mani peopl and nation were not hostil to iraq thei were friend with vest interest in iraq two preced sentenc as publish thei thought that iraq would not hold out how can a small nation like iraq hold out after an unparallel feroci aggress how can it hold out after such a comprehens sieg and a polit and media offens thei thought it wa just a matter of time even when you speak logic and on a legal basi and advanc convinc and clear argument under normal circumst the repres of state x or state y shake hi head and sai we love the iraqi peopl and sympath with them but what can we do thi man speak now mayb in a year we will not see him he will not be commit or respons not that he is a man of bad faith but he act realist as on would expect in our world as you know stand base on principl and moral valu ar not there anymor now there is realpolitik thing ar differ now now we seek interview with un secur council member even repres of member nation that particip in the aggress on iraq i ask to meet them in my resid at the iraqi ambassador s hous we sit for an hour or an hour and a half and talk we disagre but thei listen earnestli to what i sai as for the nation that have no tendenti stand toward iraq and those that had interest with iraq in the past and were friend with iraq these began to listen attent and empath with our grievanc and the arbitrari fashion in which iraq is treat and the unpreced text which ar not necessari even from the un secur council s perspect these nation now listen and understand then there is the recept our envoi had when thei visit foreign countri we recent made visit that until recent were out of the question i visit austria and met with it foreign minist and on my wai back i visit spain and met with spanish offici these ar sign that iraq s posit is be understood much more than in the past on thing that we must also particularli note as media peopl is the visit made to iraq by major entrepreneur who ar heavyweight in their countri some or most of these nation ar member of the un secur council and thei can decid to lift or retain the embargo or prolong or curtail it their visit to iraq their meet with iraqi offici and their search for job opportun indic that thei complet acknowledg iraq s steadfast it is obviou that thei admit iraq ha stood fast in the face of the blockad the polit and media campaign and all the conspiraci that have been concoct against it at the same time it is an acknowledg that the blockad will be lift and that after it is lift these state and compani will try to benefit from deal with iraq which enjoi a huge potenti in term of econom cooper all these ar posit sign but just as excess pessim is complet wrong excess optim also lack balanc as the leader presid stress on mani occas we have to stand fast on all level thi is our firm iraqi nation option we have to stand fast to continu our work on the domest level and to invest all our revenu energi and creativ to run our affair in order to confront the impact of the blockad the world s awar and acknowledg of our success in thi area will help shorten the remain time of the blockad it is howev clear to me and to ani object observ that thi subject is and will be under discuss as an offici who hold direct contact with state i do not advis set date or to sai sinc the blockad wa not lift in mai it will not be lift in juli thi is wrong both polit and diplomat there is a meet in juli which is veri import and possibl decis although deliber discuss and propos insid the secur council mai take a month thi is possibl thi is a us polit process and saudi arabia emploi pressur and bribe on state or anoth to delai the issu for two or three week ekeu mai rais a new issu for the first time we have to prepar ourselv for all possibl thi doe not mean that move toward lift the blockad have stop or will stop on the contrari thei ar still go on firmli and will achiev result god will i do not want to set a date as thi is wrong the presid said dure a cabinet meet yesterdai that the remain time is shorter than the time that ha elaps i can add a word and sai that the remain time is much shorter not onli in dai or even in month than the time that ha elaps acknowledg that iraq ha stood fast is obviou those who deni thi deni realiti thei know the realiti but thei do not want to admit it becaus thei do not want to reveal their failur the unit state doe not want to offici announc the failur of it program against iraq the same appli to some us satellit includ some arab and some other unrespect and imbalanc state the major of state includ the secur council member state and european asian and other state know and admit that iraq ha stood fast and that the steadfast of a countri like iraq with human leadership scientif and cultur qualif and with a huge econom potenti mean that it ha a bright futur therefor these state should deal with strong and prosper iraq that enjoi thi huge potenti a question from al thawrah chief editor taha al basri there ar two question directli relat to thi subject concern the impress that there is a littl deviat in the posit of the three state which the deputi prime minist mention name russia franc and china these question mai be trigger by what western media ar circul to the effect that these state ar link the question of reconsid the embargo to resolut that ar not directli relat to resolut 687 particularli resolut 833 and 688 in press interview the envoi of russia and franc suggest that iraq ha to abid by these two resolut thu give the impress thei lean somewhat toward the us posit which did not discuss resolut 687 from a technic viewpoint but link that resolut to other resolut that ar not directli relat to it these two resolut concern the measur taken by the un secur council and the sanction impos on iraq we want you to explain the motiv behind the statement which spoke clearli about or hint at iraq s deal with these two resolut particularli those made by the russian and french envoi in press interview thi is on question the second question is certain perman member particularli franc ask ekeu the special commiss chairman to submit a monthli report on the extent of progress or the problem between iraq and the un special committe ha anyth happen in thi regard should we expect ani posit step as a result of that request the request give the impress that franc doe not want the unit state to be the onli parti that is well inform about what is go on and that other perman member must also know everyth ha anyth happen in thi regard what ar the posit aspect of the french request mr tariq aziz said regard the first question i said at the begin of thi meet that there is an impress or a view that there is some chang or retreat or as mr al basri ha describ it a deviat in the posit of the three state franc russia and china i underlin that there is no chang in their posit from a legal viewpoint russia franc and china do not link resolut 687 to the other resolut thei do not link from a legal viewpoint the implement of paragraph 22 to the other resolut that ar not relat to what we call section c of resolut 687 howev thei sai that deal with or address the other resolut will facilit the implement of paragraph 22 and will eas or remov the pretext which the other parti the american and those who go along with them us to obstruct the remov of the sanction thi is their argument there is noth new in thi i heard the same thing from them in novemb 1993 and when i met with them in march i heard it for the third time dure my recent meet with them to state thi or not state it doe not mean there is a chang in their posit there ar other un secur council resolut that concern other issu these state have an interest in these resolut for polit reason and becaus thei have interest with saudi arabia with kuwait and in the region and not onli with iraq thei also have an interest becaus these resolut were issu by the secur council of which thei ar perman member i expect them to show interest in these resolut and to ask iraq to deal with them thi is not surpris for us but in addit to thi thei call in the un secur council to recogn that there is posit progress and for look into the question of lift the embargo as soon as possibl the french the russian and the chines envoi specif impli in march and thi month that the question of lift the embargo should be expediti discuss the french repres said in hi speech that the time will come veri soon to discuss thi issu with respect to the monthli report it ha becom a monthli event after the french presid of the un secur council ask ekeu to submit a monthli report as of march ekeu submit on on 28 april and it wa a posit report todai he will submit hi second report to the council over the past few dai i believ saturdai or sundai the foreign minist on hi wai to cairo through amman accompani by amir rashid director of the militari industri organ met with ekeu in amman to discuss an issu that need to be follow up as lieuten gener amir rashid told me ekeu promis to submit a factual report thi mean the report will be a posit on becaus the fact ar posit al qadisiyah chief editor hani wuhayyib ask the follow question some press sourc sai a retract took place in the mai session compar with what wa achiev in the march session and that the man on the street fals believ that so long as the us stand is against the lift of the embargo the man on the street also believ that the unit state is the countri hold swai over the council and the on that decid what resolut ar issu thi weaken the chanc of lift the embargo the man on the street also believ that even if there is a major within the council for lift the embargo the unit state will veto ani resolut call for lift the embargo and that all thi result in frustrat for the man on street tariq aziz said i want to speak about thi topic befor becaus i hear such talk even from my own famili thei ask me how can the embargo be lift if the unit state doe not want it in 1990 and 1991 the unit state succeed in pass resolut against iraq through the consent of the member countri in the council or through pressur thi wa why the resolut were pass with an overwhelm major some resolut were even unanim pass countri which had the right of veto and did not support these resolut did not us the veto thei abstain thi actual happen that s why there were so mani resolut why do these countri which particip in these resolut includ three perman member countri meet with the iraqi deputi prime minist dure hi visit to washington thei talk with him and discuss the detail of the implement of the resolut and dure the council session thei call for lift the embargo thei know the unit state will not agre why then their interest will not be serv if the embargo is not lift on might sai thei ar placat iraqi to obtain their interest how can thei get their interest if the embargo is not lift how can franc russia the prc spain brazil the perman and nonperman member resum their trade exchang with iraq if the embargo is not lift the countri which deep down know that the embargo will not be lift will not deal with us why bother had i been an ambassador of a countri with interest in the world and the iraqi deputi prime minist come and ask me to speak why should i bother with him know that hi caus is a lost caus becaus the unit state will not agre what he obtain from saudi arabia kuwait and the us alli and follow in the region is better than wast hi time with me in other word it is a futil matter it is true that the unit state still ha influenc in the world howev the us influenc is no longer the same as that in 1990 91 and 92 thi is becaus chang have occur in russia china franc and the world as a whole you now see the result of elect in hungari where the former communist parti wa toppl howev thi parti reorgan itself as a socialist parti under a liber system whose ruler fulli support the unit state in 1992 hungari s repres in the secur council wa more cruel toward us than the us repres under a liber system and after elect which were fulli democrat by western standard thi parti won 56 percent of vote and an overwhelm parliamentari major thi also happen in poland in addit to the result of elect in russia the world is chang but not in the direct specifi by georg bush which wa call the new world order the georg bush order is finish it fell down and fail there is now a differ intern situat with a measur of balanc i cannot sai thi situat ha the same full balanc as that which exist befor gorbachev assum power prior to the soviet union s downfal howev the world is develop a new shape by creat new balanc thu you find that the iraqi posit enjoi be listen to thei ar listen to us now which wa not the case in 1992 even those who us to lend us a deaf ear as the popular sai goe ar now listen to us receiv us in their capit and send firm to discuss contract and project henc thei know that the blockad will be lift and that the unit state will not willingli obstruct lift the blockad the unit state is now obstruct and it us to obstruct thi had it not been for the us posit it would have been possibl to serious discuss implement paragraph 22 of resolut 687 in decemb 1992 after an offici document on deal with resolut 715 wa submit the unit state howev obstruct thi ekeu will submit a report after which there will be a studi of the so call test period these ar the result of the us obstruct the unit state can obstruct and perpetu thing it howev cannot ultim stop them a preliminari discuss ha thu far been held in the circl and the corridor of the secur council i ask ambassador from import state whether the unit state would resort to the veto thei said we rule out a veto base on my simpl knowledg in thi regard my analysi wa that the unit state will not us the veto becaus the secur council resolut against iraq were base on the so call intern consensu consensu at the secur council but when most secur council member state and most perman member state see that the reason for impos the blockad and embargo ar remov and that onli the unit state ha us the veto then the legal and logic basi for these resolut will fall consequ these state can sai that thei would not compli with these resolut if the unit state want to control the secur council through it isol decis iraq thei will think then ha legitim interest these nation will argu that the reason that were behind the wai thei handl iraq did not obtain so let s act independ their argument goe these nation have polit militari and econom clout the major of the intern commun will then follow suit and the us posit will becom isol just as it is on cuba the unit state is boycot cuba but the unit kingdom is not and the same hold for brazil and franc each weigh it own interest the american ar bound to make their posit clear soon now i explain to you that in the most recent session it emerg that as regard iraq the unit state is in a minor in the secur council thi is import i even told an ambassador that thi ladi the us un deleg or ani other deleg for that matter is suppos to portrai a true pictur when thei find themselv beleagu and in the minor camp she should tell her leader that on that issu we ar now a minor i told him do you think she will sai thi to her presid he said ye i think she will furthermor it is now report and shown on televis screen you as media peopl watch foreign televis station that ar monitor the situat it is now obviou that the us posit belong in the minor dr sabah yasin put the follow question you mention progress on the polit front howev the new media have now embark on a new drive to disrupt or delai the mechan of the special commiss and involv it in the implement of resolut 715 impli that the mechan of the commiss is also ti to a us polit decis how accur is thi assess how ar you deal with the special commiss and iaea to speed the complet of it final report that will contribut to the work of paragraph 22 section c mr tariq aziz answer the previou question i said that if it were not for the us posit the special commiss and the iaea would have gone to the secur council in januari and told them that the road is now open for a debat on paragraph 22 and that for our part we ar readi thi much i told ekeu in the presenc of hi aid and member of the iraqi deleg i told him you can now go to the secur council and tell them i am satisfi becaus you know and i know that you obtain all that section c of resolut 687 requir by such delai you ar save the us administr i told him you ar present ambigu point grai as thei sai you ar help the us posit he could not prove the contrari and defend himself but could not prove me wrong thi game howev ha an end thi is becaus thi game is plai accord to pretext of a technic natur when these pretext becom clear peopl will sai iraq ha a good point anoth import thing is what ha happen from januari until now includ the monthli report other nation that previous did not care about the special commiss s report and took them at their face valu now take an interest in the detail of the special commiss s work whenev there is an report by the special commiss or ani statement by ekeu that tell them that iraq did not agre to so and so and thi is consid a violat of the ceas fire resolut the un secur council would immedi issu a statement sai iraq ha violat the ceas fire resolut you recal the last statement that wa issu in thi month in 1993 by the secur council regard the monitor camera now the state that ar interest in lift the embargo impos on iraq ar interest in the work of the commiss consequ the staff of the special commiss includ it chairman ar now awar that all ey ar watch so thei cannot fabric mani pretext there will probabl be a pretext here or a pretext there but there ar qualifi iraqi to tackl and explain thi there ar deleg the deleg which we visit as well as the deleg that made visit to variou capit we were send specialist to explain to the state that ar interest in the work of the special commiss the minut detail concern what iraq ha done and the pretext which the special commiss mai fabric to prolong the process these high level expert explain thing to the french the russian the chines and other thi process continu whenev we felt there wa a need to make a technic explan we ar do that now thi time when we went to new york no on rais thi question except the unit state the us li were disdain becaus thi wa a us polit posit and us propaganda even the british who support the us polit posit did not rais ani technic pretext regard the work of the special committe the british envoi said the committe s report indic progress and that work is proceed well the same goe for the iaea it report fall in that direct therefor accord to expect the special commiss and the iaea will undoubtedli soon go to the council to announc what ha been achiev and juli is approach as i have said let us consid the worst possibl you must both go to the secur council and sai thi is what ha been achiev we complet the implement of section c of resolut 687 now how would the council deal with the subject amir al hulw alif ba chief editor said there is a question which the ordinari man in the street in iraq is ask and the same question wa ask by the chairman of the us congress foreign relat committe what doe the unit state want from iraq the unit state is now rais certain polit issu and sai that iraq ha not arriv at thi level of respons without that level of pressur so let us continu in the same wai to realiz certain polit object some of which you have address tariq aziz funnili enough the chairman of the us congress foreign relat committe ask thi question to assist secretari of state pelletreau in a hear and demand an answer pelletreau promis to send a written confidenti answer we heard from our sourc there that the answer did not satisfi the foreign relat committe chairman not becaus of the answer itself but becaus the answer wa not clear there ar two side to the us posit there is the well known public posit the unit state ha taken a hostil attitud toward iraq and set certain object for iraq it target it as a countri a peopl and a nation leadership but none of these object ha been realiz yesterdai i wa at a meet with two us journalist who ar follow the issu i told them that when i met with baker in geneva he threaten me he said we will hit you and return iraq to the pre industri ag and that anoth leadership will decid the futur of iraq i said to him your excel the minist your countri is veri strong and you have huge potenti and deadli weapon ye you will caus sever damag to us and it is clear from your talk that you will attack us but iraq is 6 000 year old ha experienc mani difficulti suffer much from invas and remain capabl of offer sacrific and achiev progress and prosper therefor your first aim of return us to the pre industri ag will not be achiev the second aim the replac of the leadership will also not take place becaus the iraqi peopl the arab nation and the region s peopl hate the unit state for it hostil to the arab nation it bia toward the enemi of the arab nation and it encroach on and it exploit of our countri and our nation therefor everi on fight the unit state will be back by the peopl i then gave him the follow exampl you know that when egypt lost the war with israel in 1967 jamal abd al nasir resign but the egyptian mass return him to center of leadership despit the clear unjustifi militari defeat at that time the peopl refus to submit to the logic of the isra enemi which wa support by the unit state in the 1967 aggress i said to them now we ar in 1994 ar we realli in the pre industri ag thei said no we visit baghdad and other capit in the region the situat in baghdad is better than that of other capit electr power exist around the clock while it is cut off in damascu for 12 to 14 hour a dai and while egypt is suffer from problem in the servic area although these countri ar not besieg thei also continu their trade oper yet servic ar better in baghdad thi is what thei and not tariq aziz sai so the first aim return iraq to the pre industri ag ha fail and the second aim ha also fail it is clear that iraq and it leadership ar still steadfast and that the peopl ar ralli around their leadership becaus thi is the polici the iraqi have chosen at least in the modern ag sinc the 1920 revolut a nation polici of digniti strength and independ the current us administr doe not want to admit it failur but it will admit it in the final analysi thi is luckili how the american act thei ar pragmatist the pragmatist refus to admit failur for some time but admit it later it is known that confus exist in us foreign polici it is their circl press and congress which sai thi and not me there is confus in us foreign polici therefor run us foreign polici is neither organ nor clear even to the american themselv thei take thi or that posit becaus the matter is not clear to them thi kind of confus affect us posit toward mani issu includ iraq as i have previous said the unit state ha begun to discov that it isol in the secur council ha becom complet a promin ambassador told me that when the propos to lift the blockad on iraq is put on the tabl the unit state should choos and will choos some western circl expect the unit state not to oppos the unanim or the major decis in the council journalist ahmad abd al majid ask the follow question there is a view be circul in our quarter that the iraqi diplomaci ha concentr it effort over the past period on the member of the secur council and that it ha somewhat delai it move outsid thi framework in your assess what would we have gain if we had concentr our effort toward these countri instead of the member of the secur council could we have achiev the same result we have achiev dure thi period or could we have seen progress in the stand or level of understand of these countri tariq aziz i admit that in the first phase of our diplomat move in 1991 and 1992 we focus on the secur council member state thi wa not a wrong option becaus ultim the secur council is the on which will make the decis ani african countri will becom more import when it becom a member of the secur council when thi countri is not a member of the secur council it will continu to be import but will not have a vote at the secur council when it take part in the vote at the secur council such a countri will becom more import therefor diplomat move focus on the member state of the secur council thi is correct howev should we be satisfi with thi thi is the question should we be satisfi with the move toward the member of the secur council my answer is no for thi reason i told you that recent we expand our contact to cover state that ar not member of the secur council but which ar also influenti india and malaysia were member of the secur council but now thei ar not indonesia would becom a secur council member next year so we move toward it and the foreign minist paid a visit to indonesia which declar posit stand on lift the sieg of iraq as for europ we ar contact european countri i visit two european countri on dure my departur trip to new york and the other dure my return trip foreign ministri offici wisam al zahawi and dr abd al amir al anbari tour europ thei visit all of eastern europ the czech republ is the onli east european countri which is now a member of the secur council the iraqi repres at the unit nation visit poland romania and hungari in addit to the czech republ wisam al zahawi visit greec the vatican germani austria while dr al anbari visit portug in addit to spain which is a member of the secur council we ar contact these countri now it would have been us had we visit these countri in 1991 and 1992 howev we should pai attent to a veri import thing which i mention at the begin of the meet had we sent 10 deleg to visit all the world in 1991 and 1992 thei would certainli would receiv govern and popular organ sympathi with iraq it leadership and iraq s leader but practic these countri would have done noth for us now that iraq ha remain steadfast and the world ha becom awar of thi a chang ha been notic in the secur council thi is signific those in asia and europ would sai sinc there is a chang in the secur council there should be someth new therefor when an iraqi envoi visit them thei will show concern listen to him discuss thing with him and speak about their futur interest with him thu the visit would achiev it result if there wa ani shortcom in the past thi ha been tackl and the result which ar be achiev from the contact with these countri will be us salah al mukhtar chief editor of al jumhuriyah ask the follow question if the unit state insist on maintain the blockad and tri to oppos the will of the major then the other nation will have to weasel out of their commit regard the blockad can we assum and thi question ha been discuss by the turkish media that turkei on account of it econom crisi will perhap be the first nation to weasel out of it offici commit with regard to the blockad if the unit state continu it in an arbitrari wai anoth question if we assum that the secur council want to lift the blockad soon doe thi requir a statement or a new resolut there ar two conflict view on thi issu some peopl sai that the council need a new resolut to lift the blockad and sinc there ha not been a unanim posit on thi then the lift of the blockad is delai anoth view maintain that a statement by the council will do which view is correct a statement or a resolut as a prelud to lift the blockad i also have a queri about a report publish by the local press the report sai that a former member of the us congress who visit iraq last month said that a confer for businessmen will be held in washington in mai to discuss lift the blockad and it effect on us firm and interest he said the iraqi trade and oil minist ar invit is thi true tariq aziz regard the second issu whether a statement or a resolut is need it is my person view that implement paragraph 22 requir a resolut becaus it is part of a resolut and therefor it implement requir a resolut technic speak issu a statement by the secur council is more difficult than issu a resolut despit the fact that a statement doe not have the power of a resolut accord to the secur council tradit a statement should get the approv of the five perman secur council member state who have the veto right if ani of them insist on oppos the statement then the presid of the secur council will be embarrass to issu the statement and the statement he make will not have the strength of a secur council statement a resolut howev can be issu by a major of nine member provid it is not oppos or veto by a perman member so technic speak issu a resolut is easier than issu a statement as for turkei and the other the turk have been sai that the blockad ha greatli harm turkei on the financi econom secur and social level these statement ar issu by senior turkish offici when the turkish foreign ministri under secretari visit baghdad and befor that in our contact with the turkish side we told them why don t you cite articl 50 of the un charter which sai someth like when the secur council adopt a resolut impos an embargo against a certain countri then the countri that is harm by thi embargo mai go to the council and ask for it problem to be solv the council could compens it on wai or anoth and it can discuss the wai to remedi thi situat with the council of cours the council doe not have enough monei to give compens the parti that us to pai the compens is known to the countri that took part in the aggress and the blockad against iraq howev thi well is run dry becaus the unit state is us too much of it and the well is not the wai it wa befor monei is no longer be paid the secur council doe not have enough monei to give to anybodi turkei can go to the secur council and sai base on articl 50 we want to deal with iraq and the iraqi do not mind in principl but thei would not allow turkei to do thi there is great pressur on turkei and it is not allow to go to the council at present i person have no inform about the third new report thi might have happen if such a meet take place and if iraqi offici ar invit to it i would recommend particip in it although the us side is tens and doe not want to see an iraqi thei deport the head of the iraqi interest section without ani legal or diplomat justif becaus thei ar upset by ani iraqi presenc in washington though veri limit thei do not want to see an iraqi we go there for a week and meet with media men and televis correspond in my opinion thi provid an opportun for an iraqi minist to explain the situat to the us businessmen some us businessmen us to deal with iraq normal we bought from them merchandis and agricultur crop such as grain meat and mani other civilian product thei have all lost the iraqi market thei ar talk in us circl about their loss and how long thi situat will continu
