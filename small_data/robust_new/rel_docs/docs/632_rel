econom develop lack mechan and intern motiv forc for reli on s t progress s t develop lack vital in orient toward econom construct and larg number of technic achiev cannot be convert into forc of

so on that it face in common no countri can achiev modern in a close state 5 china s s t develop must begin with our nation condit china ha a larg popul a weak foundat and underdevelop social forc of

restrict by our popul resourc environ and other factor our popul ha alreadi surpass 1 1 billion and even if we strictli control it rate of growth it will still grow to 1 5 billion by the 2020 s although china ha rather abund total amount of most resourc thei ar rel insuffici in term of per capita amount of resourc compar to the world averag we have on third the per capita cultiv land area on

china is on of the world s nation have the highest amount of energi consum per unit valu of output and social labor product is equival to onli about 5 percent of advanc world level in the final analysi these discrep ar discrep in s t level educ level and manag level if we still lack a sens of crisi and urgenc and do not do everyth we can to catch up the discrep will not shrink and thei mai even expand the object of china s socialist modern and construct will be in danger of fall through and we will not have the place in the world that we should have 6 the kei to modern our nation
