but i m not the sort of person to go around talk about women s right too earnestli is what you re do part of the feminist movement i m reluct to sai ye becaus femin is such a dirti word for a lot of peopl but femin ha help us to see more clearli what ha been go on in the church the wai women have been treat and understood the church wa take it cue from secular societi but would lose all credibl if it did not press ahead and there wa a preced it renunci of slaveri after centuri just under a third of the laiti but slightli more than a third of the clergi oppos the ordin of women accord to

simpli a matter of who sai the eucharist prayer we re deal with someth veri import how we understand god how we understand sexual and relat between women and men so long as the church sai that women cannot adequ repres christ at the altar then our theologi is open to question is the gender of god a separ question from whether women should be priest or not she hesit i person don t think it s separ but let s be honest there s no sex to god it s a conveni metaphor we re talk metaphor all the time here and i think we need to enlarg our vision of god all the time but women priest equal femal god is not what i want to sai at all devout anglican see women s ordin as the last nail in the coffin of tradit christian a few have gone further claim that in new zealand it ha caus an outbreak of religi witchcraft there ar as mani or more said the curat who feel it s not fair to dump it all at the feet of women priest to have women as priest redress the balanc a littl bit but no wai doe it alter the fundament of the faith some objector quot biblic author for their view other ar just shock by the thought that such a long tradit is to be broken yet methodist baptist and other english non conformist have alreadi broken it and there ar 1 500 women priest in anglican church oversea and two women bishop for dilli baker the fact that jesu chose male discipl is not persuas thei were not chosen as priest and church hierarchi develop much later in accord with social custom the fact that christ wa a man did not prevent him confer import role on mari and martha jesu came to take on our flesh to
