women i suspect proce to shed their life blood and other peopl s in defenc of them meanwhil realiti ha move on and the abstract is beach like some beauti empti shell after the tide ha eb is the sanctiti of life on such or more emphat the absolut sanctiti of life my mother s famili were farmer in south africa and somewher in the famili folklor there is a stori of a young man and hi best friend ride out into the bush to shoot game some 20 mile from home thei encount and wound a lion but the friend is thrown from hi hors and terribl maul by the wound beast hi injuri were appal and agonis obvious he cannot surviv the long rough journei home to leav him and ride for help is to abandon him to the lion to stai with him onli a prolong of hi terribl pain the onli kindli solut is quick and merci oblivion the bullet in the back of the head wa hi onli option and so he shot hi friend most christian moral theologian would agre in spite of much loud advocaci from christian protest group i do not find the absolut sanctiti of life written anywher in scriptur or tradit thou shalt not kill mean no murder but kill abound in the old testament the long held concept of the just war ha a respect place in christian moral theologi and wa much in plai in the month lead up the gulf war so the sanctiti of life seem easili suspend when more urgent interest superven there ar more than 100

act on the belief that there ar a good mani other thing further up the sanctiti scale than human life other abstract noun no doubt but when i come to lie in mortal pain i don t want ani abstract noun stand between me and merci oblivion i have had enough experi of pain in my 60 year insid thi creaki bodi to be sure of that but i certainli do not want to put my doctor in the postion of have to break the most solemn oath of hi profess to save life not to take it he must not cross that boundari there ha been much comment in the press about the case of dr alan cox tri and convict in winchest crown court for the attempt murder of a patient the moral and practic issu ar immens complex and confus and not much help by abstract noun public debat is essenti for i have no doubt that the pressur for some form of legal euthanasia will becom irresist in the next 50 year if we ar to go that wai we must get it right clearli the winchest juri wa right in law dr cox intend to kill he wa therefor guilti but men rea guilti intent is a slipperi fish the doctor s choic of drug wa not a painkil but a heart stopper a bullet would have had the same purpos and effect he chose to end the pain by end the life but hi intent wa not malign it wa benign if alwai do unto other what you would have them do unto you is the greatest moral precept of human relationship then it could be said he wa do the same final act of love servic that hi friend did for the young man maul by the lion i would hope so to be love myself in such a case should we sai then a friend mai do it but a doctor mai not even to end intoler pain moral philosoph have a us concept of doubl effect in thi case we have two effect pain kill and life kill it is moral accept for a doctor to administ a drug to kill pain even if the immedi or longer term consequ is the death of the patient it is moral unaccept for a doctor to administ a life kill drug as a wai of end pain a b is alright b a is not it is a subtl line you mai think between kill to end the pain and kill the pain and so end the life but it is on on which their solemn oath and our essenti trust in our doctor stand or fall it is too danger to allow merci kill to go on sub rosa amid a kindli conspiraci of silenc among the medic the conclus i draw from thi though with some trepid is not that euthanasia in such circumst must be alwai ban it is rather that the burden of thi decis must not be left to doctor the vast major of case will continu to fall on the accept side of the line and will offer patient the benign exit through pain kill drug but these except case will have to be held by the commun through appropri panel in partnership with the best medic advic death is not a medic respons it belong to all of us the case of excess pain is not the onli on that will come to claim the panel s attent there is a continuum through irrevers coma alzheim s to prematur senil dementia and on to mental handicap and inconveni old ag thi is the dread slipperi slope but the social pressur to move on to that slope is alreadi irresist mani doctor ar stand at it upper edg legal enforc guidelin or legal constitut panel ar the onli bulwark against the slide the ethic problem in these case is rather differ but if we do not address it and find an accept legal protect for it i believ we will find peopl take their own live and the live of their dear on into their own hand less benign agenc mai follow what totalitarian regim or venal doctor might get up to onc the wall is breach is certainli frighten but i do not think thei will be deter more in the futur than thei have
