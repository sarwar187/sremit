point at him he said he sure understand that establish peac is in their suprem interest raz still the last two murder took place insid israel pere ye but we know who perpetr them hama islam resist movement not the plo did thi murder occur in arab countri too fundamentalist exist there too i believ that when the agreement is translat into realiti we will feel the chang on the ground raz when will the agreement turn into realiti inde the talk in taba and pari ar slate to resum next week i understand and thi is anoth stage on the wai toward implement pere numer speak we overcam onli some of the problem qualit we surmount most of the difficult problem although we ar face addit difficult problem still i must tell you though that there were moment dure these talk that i doubt we would overcom the gap ar so big i am refer to gap in formul in view and even more so in feel raz how did you manag to overcom problem then who gave or cave in pere thi is not a matter of cave in it is not a give and take type of negoti you know mani ask me what we receiv from israel s viewpoint we first and foremost negoti with ourselv rather than with the palestinian the likud act wise it conduct negoti with itself it did not give up anyth the disadvantag is that thi cannot lead to ani result rather thi can result in greater enmiti and hatr greater danger and number of casualti involv where doe thi unforgett geniu lead raz still what ar the weak in the agreement you work out in cairo pere you know we initi said we would give the palestinian honor and thei would give us secur or rather agre on secur issu but the truth is that what we call secur thei call honor and what thei term honor we think of as secur for exampl will the palestinian policemen station in the border termin be arm with pistol or not can you conceiv of a policeman without a pistol a policeman need weapon for self defens in case an arm person enter or in case somebodi run wild thi is a simpl exampl of a problem that caus hardship raz thei will have pistol after all i believ pere ye refer is to up to 10 policemen raz so is it becaus of 10 arm policemen that the defens establish had so mani reserv accord to sever report pere do not lead me into thi kind of fals drama there is a militari echelon which should give militari advic thi is it duti and i have no complaint about thi just as doctor give medic counsel the armi counsel on secur issu and should insist on thi and so should the politician for their part insist on what is polit necessari i have no complaint about thi doubt aris though the whole issu of cross the border termin for instanc thei sai we ar give them autonomi rather than independ but when a jericho resid arriv at the termin what doe autonomi mean to him let him be welcom by a palestinian policeman with a palestinian flag we said no we want to check everyon who goe through you can ask why there is an argument over a policeman the argument is not over a policeman but over a sea of feel of anxieti suspicion and hope and with correct phrase you can sometim surmount problem raz who guarante mr pere that these formul will pass the test of realiti your experi show that arafat went back on agreement at the veri last minut pere who can guarante there will be no war or anyth els for that matter gambl or risk is the name of the game wherev you turn you mai bring about war but then you mai also bring about peac there ar no absolut guarante rather absolut choic if you ask me the palestinian ar dead tire of the current situat i notic the great distress the numer intern struggl thei have constantli experienc regard the negoti thei too ar face an opposit the differ is that our is usual express in no confid motion while their is manifest in shoot to kill a death threat is hover over almost everi person who sat to the negoti tabl with us raz what request or demand by the palestinian we could not accept pere for instanc a demand that we shoulder joint rather than full respons for the border the termin and the road which connect the settlement to israel thei told us do you think we do not want to fight murder our answer wa although it is true that we cannot guarante the safeti of our peopl 100 percent even when we ar fulli in charg of secur still when someth happen god forbid nobodi would doubt that we made our best effort to prevent thi we told them imagin that we share respons that you and we each share 50 percent respons and a fatal incid occur everyon will then sai it is becaus of you that we do not have full secur as for the three road the palestinian told us is it for a singl settlement with 28 famili that you want to control a 5 km long road to have the right to absolut respons over thi road and the area alongsid it raz you ar refer to the settlement of netzarim i understand pere i am talk of two road which branch off from the qatif bloc on southward south east and the other northward north east as well as a road to netzarim the palestinian sai we have villag and traffic too after all while you want 5 km for 28 famili you have to be logic too as to what you ar do i am give the other side s content you know sit at home and negoti with yourself is veri simpl but here you sit opposit the other side and want to reach an agreement with it rather than to impos an agreement there were moment when thei simpli said thei could not go back to their peopl with what wa rais well if it is imposs it is imposs raz thi mai be a hypothet question but would you support the evacu of ani settlement in the gaza strip pere not under the pressur of negoti i believ the likud establish a terribl preced with regard to the sinai those who critic us about the settlement todai ar those who forcefulli evacu the settler from the sinai at the time to tell you the truth i have question which should be ask out loud inde what is the sens in keep a settlement of 28 famili that need labor from thailand that need a militari compani to defend them and whose road should alwai be protect where ar the bound of logic here have we not effect cut in the israel aircraft industri and refa el armament develop author ar these not cut in the defens sphere we went to maximum extrem here from the econom and secur viewpoint i heard on of the settlement resid sai that the idf israel defens forc would not have stai in the area had it not been for them well what doe the armi need to do there the moment we decid the idf will not be gaza s policeman then raz interrupt i would like to go beyond the palestinian issu how doe thi agreement you consolid in cairo influenc other track of the negoti the talk with syria jordan and lebanon pere first thi agreement sure impress the world why thi wa becaus we overcam veri complex problem involv histor mental and territori disagr without gun fire without war threat without plane as for the syrian if thei do not expand the negoti if thei maintain them on a narrow path we will face onli difficulti i believ we have a veri talent repres our ambassador in washington itamar rabinovich who know the subject matter and how to conduct negoti he is a veri seriou abl person but he will not be abl to make progress on thi narrow path raz ar you allud to the necess of have a summit meet with al asad pere ye but in gener the negoti should be expand in my opinion it is desir to have a meet between al asad and rabin and the negoti should then move into the polit plane look how matter proceed with egypt the negoti cannot remain so control and restrict to such a narrow channel laughingli we need a second channel refer to new israel televis channel 2 raz how about jordan pere as for jordan the jordanian have taken step the king s statement is import in my opinion i think that he admit that there were secret meet first in other word he pave the road for open meet in the futur he said raz interrupt is a date emerg for an open meet alreadi pere not yet not yet the point about the jordanian is that thei ar sai the correct thing now we did succe in on thing we stop the secreci i told the jordanian is peac an underground matter why ar you complain about leak on our side we dislik that you want to conceal thi in the first place what do you mean by thi so now the jordanian came out with matter openli i am also happi that the king spoke of the econom issu incident arafat too began to discuss econom with me i think he even quot from a book i wrote but then he mai have want to pleas me who know raz there is anoth question i must ask you do you too think that the govern will have to resign if a referendum is held and the govern doe not win a major pere i think it will win a major i cannot conceiv of anyth els if we succe in the negoti the major will support us if we fail we will need to be thrown out anywai a govern is elect everi four year rather than four dai sinc a govern which cannot be unpopular doe not deserv to rule the four year ar grant so that the govern can also adopt

be so i cannot tell how we will deal with them howev we can deal with such result through coordin for thi reason we call for coordin hijjawi why doe the palestinian side refrain from coordin with the jordanian side al anani it is not a matter of refrain but of interpret concern the prioriti hijjawi to what extent will the central bank of jordan control the jordanian currenc that will remain in

area of concern sir ar mani but let me give you an exampl of what my brother probabl had in mind and what i have examin with my colleagu what we have talk about in jordan for exampl we have a border problem and in particular in the southern area the dead sea right down to the gulf of al aqabah well in the period after 1967 isra forc sort of move into jordanian territori without war without fight for secur reason we couldn t do veri much about it at that time but we regist the fact we would like to see progress made as soon as possibl to resolv thi particular problem the problem of territori sovereignti of border demarc and delin we ar call for a committe to look at thi subject as rapidli as possibl and i hope that thi will lead obvious to meet on the ground there at import high level onc thi is done as oppos to suggest that mayb jordan can leas land jordan cannot thi is jordanian land then we will look at the whole rift vallei as an econom unit and we will look at everyth that we can do to make it so to see what benefit can be deriv of our joint effort to make that on of the most import element of the come peac be it in term of miner resourc in term of commun in term of the environ in term of so mani other element that would come along as well thi is someth that we hope will happen and will begin to see realiz sometim soon and thi lead onto the environment question fight desertif and deal with that anoth area is water and that is veri veri import to all of us so again we hope that veri veri soon we will concentr on that and see what can be done to ensur that the futur is bright at least in term of the right of all of us on on hand and then what can be done beyond that becaus i don t believ that the resourc avail in the area ar suffici to all of us thi is a problem that is veri much on our mind we cannot ignor it and we have to look at other wai and mean by which we can provid the water that is need within our region in the camp david accord there is an area or an item that deal with a road that would link egypt and therefor arab north africa with the arab world and that would pass through elat we have suggest recent that why not let us look at that at thi time and hopefulli see what can be done becaus that will be a veri import step forward as well there ar mani other relat issu and possibl noth ha been settl noth ha been discuss mayb in depth as yet but for exampl we were look at link our nation grid system with the egyptian on through a cabl under the gulf of al aqabah do we need to do that now or can we look at a much more logic wai of approach thi particular problem tourism movement of peopl these ar just some area which my brother probabl touch on in hi thought as he made the statement to the isra paper i believ the yedi ot aharanot if i am not mistaken in amman the other import element of cours is the question of peopl i think we all know that jordan ha born the result of everi disast that ha beset our area and our region and ha had an impact on the palestinian our brethren we ar veri anxiou to see what can be done and to bring about a chang in the qualiti of life the prioriti ha to go obvious to gaza and the west bank to the occupi territori but beyond that we have to look at the whole region and what can peac bring with it on the human level in that regard there is a pend problem as well which we hope to address and that is the reunif of famili in term of those who legal should be reunit with their famili in the occupi territori there is so much that is be done so much that we ar do to the best of our abil in everi area and i hope that the result not onli of our effort but of the commit and effort of all concern will produc the result that all of us hope someth entir differ and mai be too difficult for me to speak about in term of limit or scope at such a meet sigmond you stress in your comment the import of comprehens and you said that you would like to see the whole area move from where we ar to where we ought to be in the past thi principl of comprehens ha serv as an element to move the area from where it is to where it ought to be becaus of the reluct on the part of mani of the player to take initi that would move the process forward for fear that the rest of the arab world is not move along to what extent do you believ in the light of the agreement on septemb 13th more recent the meet between presid al asad and presid clinton and what wa said there to what extent doe thi free bilater movement that is not depend on the most common denomin in the region could you speak to us on that subject husayn thank you veri much inde and i onc again veri happi inde that the level of confid in the area and dialogu that is go on at thi time is someth that i have not seen over the year if you take jordan and syria for exampl we ar constantli in touch i am veri happi to hear the result of the meet between presid clinton and presid al asad i have everi confid that there is on behalf of the arab parti concern a total desir and commit to the caus of a just comprehens peac so i person see that it is go to begin to manifest itself hopefulli sometim soon in term of real progress on other track but in that regard i want to make it abundantli clear as far as we ar concern we ar move we start at the same point we have the same object we ar move on our own to deal with all the problem that we have to deal with and address lead to the ratif of a peac treati as a crown achiev we would certainli hope and prai that our effort will also succe in encourag other to move and in see other movement in a meaning wai so that we arriv at our object that we have sought for so long of a comprehens peac but regard the serious of the jordanian in term of the negoti process now we ar veri seriou we ar determin and we will put our best effort to see rapid movement and achiev result the timefram is beyond me to be abl to determin at thi stage but i hope it would not be long befor we see that happen so in other word we ar not ty ourselv down to anyth except the determin to move and more rapidli we hope and we believ and we will work for our effort to result in peac and at the same time hopefulli we will see that not onli on the jordanian or palestinian isra track but also regard syria and lebanon so that we have final what we have alwai sought a comprehens peac in the region in other word we ar our own master in term of our fate and our destini we ar determin to do whatev we can but we believ that in the interest of all and futur gener in the region and in the interest of the secur of all the come gener we have to work for a comprehens peac that doe not mean that we should wait until everybodi els deal with their problem we ar also approach these problem veri veri serious there ha been some ambigu or some differ of opinion or some caus for confus we have been call upon to ratifi a peac treati some suggest were that we should ratifi it on thi visit of mine here on the occas of my visit to the unit state for a medic checkup and veri frankli my friend i don t believ thi is the right approach we do not ratifi a peac treati and then begin to negoti what it should contain we negoti and work out all the problem so that you don t have ani left onc you have peac and thi is the wai we ar go about thank you sir al mose al mose your majesti could you forese jordan s role in the territori in the intermedi period and beyond is feder still a concept that ha been word indistinct will jordan have a signific econom role beyond simpli have the dinar the offici currenc do you forese jordanian bank as be the principl bank institut in the territori educ for school children come from your ministri of educ and word indistinct so that you have a cultur econom and in time perhap polit bond between the territori and the kingdom of jordan or do you see an independ palestinian state that ha friendli relat but is independ cultur econom and polit with the kingdom of jordan husayn i can onli see base on the veri close relat of member of on famili in that region that the futur will see us come closer togeth but with all due respect to all those who have suggest feder or confeder or ani other formula at thi stage i have ask for exampl presid arafat to drop that from hi vocabulari when he talk with me the term confeder becaus thi doe not come sir as a result of the wish of an individu or even a group of peopl thi ha got to be someth that develop and matur over time we ar veri veri close togeth but there ha been a lot of damag done over the year mani misconcept mani impress that we had design over the fate of our brethern we had support them and we will continu to support them to the best of our abil will help and the futur ha to be someth that is built from the grassroot upward so in the come phase i see our role as on of support palestinian to the best of our abil in everi wai we can and help them to move ahead and hopefulli eventu peopl will work out what the relat ought to be i person believ that in palestin as is the case in jordan there is a yearn for democraci there is a yearn for institut that insur that peopl have a sai regard their futur that thi is inevit thi will come about so mai be it is prematur to speak about how it will all shape up but i am sure the link and the ti ar there and thei will develop and grow in the meantim as far as jordan is concern and all member of our jordanian famili regardless of their origin we shall remain on famili and we shall remain determin to ensur that noth touch thi fact in ani form or wai advers if and when peopl have anoth option have anoth choic individu or collect then we will look at that and thei ar free to do whatev thei wish jordan as you know is the onli arab state that share everyth with it palestinian brethern and member of the palestinian famili and again we do have problem in term of the long run we have to ensur that peopl if we ar talk about the legal of it have the right to either return or be compens or return and be compens or certainli be compens but somehow we hope that in the context of peac in the context of movement to chang the shape of thing in our area we will see a differ we will see a chang in the qualiti of life for peopl we will see them have more chanc to live the kind of life that thei deserv we will see the narrow of gap and therefor the remov of fear and suspicion that exist over so mani year we will see the children of abraham come togeth in that part of the world and everywher unidentifi speaker your majesti mani of us around the tabl who have been a kind of antidot to those in our commun who would encourag the abandon of the peac process we ourselv were encourag in septemb that at the begin of the process we would see the allevi of the arab boycott against israel in veri seriou wai we understand that it is on the agenda of a meet of the foreign minist we have read soon and i wonder if you could pleas give some of your own insight and observ on the possibl of ani level of that boycott be offici remov at that time to help us out with our commun husayn sure sir and i think that it s a good idea to discuss thi in the follow wai and mai be to clarifi again some of the misunderstand about it sir if you look at the palestinian isra dimens or jordan palestin and israel it is someth differ to the boycott let s sai of compani that have subsidiari in israel i think that that kind of situat that might have last in the past is probabl on the wai toward be remov and address but we have problem which again we have to discuss in the time ahead and it is i think an item of concern for us and hopefulli will be part of the come negoti for exampl sir and practic sinc 1970 isra restrict on jordanian export to the occupi territori ha cost jordan 2 billion deficit as a result of these polici israel ha gain a trade surplu of 7 5 billion so what i m try to sai is that we have two problem here sir how do we address them we hope that we will address the immedi on as it concern us and certainli the other on as it concern other intern concern i think that is be resolv veri veri soon i hope we will address thi on to see that the protection that exist doe not affect advers the other side and we have to work out someth new and i hope that thi will be address veri veri soon lynn lev your majesti on of the concern that i think we all have in term of how thi will move forward is the increas in violenc and the growth of fundamentalist could you respond to that and how you see it plai out and what can be done to revers fundamentalist husayn i believ madam that thi is the greatest challeng that we face on probabl either side of the divid at thi stage there ar those who believ that we must carri out our respons now and bear them in term of respons toward futur gener and there ar those who mai be live in the world of yesterdai or todai and cannot see what thi opportun mean i believ as we make progress god will we will pass through thi difficult phase and we will see that the peac camp on both side gain the upper hand as it produc result that affect the futur of peopl all our peopl in all the time to come the challeng is there the problem is on of sometim despair or lack of vision or too much trauma of what ha happen so far but let s hope and prai that we can pass through that phase as rapidli as possibl and i believ that we have the capabl and we have the determin and the stai power to go through it and see the break of a fresh dawn a new dawn in our entir region and our live unidentifi speaker your majesti you have paint a bold and encourag pictur of the word peac and i think that thi dialogu will contribut to the climat and momentum that will keep the specif negoti move forward not everyon in the middl east is commit as you ar to a comprehens peac i wonder if you might reflect a bit on the role of iran in the current discuss take place in the middl east husayn i wouldn t know what to sai in thi regard sir iran is outsid the immedi area of the problem that we ar try to address thei mai have their view thei haven t share them with us offici nor have we had the chanc to debat them with them but i believ that resolv our problem remov the root caus of instabl in that entir region and if you would look at the past mani mani year the problem ha been the ladder to power by mani ambiti individu or group that sought to gain power again refer to the question of fundament or extrem i am veri happi to see that over a number of year there is an interfaith dialogu that is cover much ground and i think all of us realiz that mani act and action taken in mani differ part of the world sometim in the name of faith and religion ar so alien to everyth we believ in and to the teach of our religion so let us hope that what can happen in our area can posit affect the rest of the world it wa a beacon it wa the sourc of illumin for the world in the past let us hope that thi will happen again it is worth our veri best effort and hopefulli we will succe in make our contribut rabbi sapisti your majesti could you reflect for a few moment on the role of the unit state in the short run what might it do to be help in enhanc the chanc that the accord will be implement and peac agreement will be sign but in the long run what role do you think the unit state need to plai militarili polit and or econom and what ar some of the caution that you give to the unit state about thing that it might be tempt to do that might be counterproduct husayn it is veri difficult for me to cover all these area sir but i think that for a long period of time the messag we have heard in our part of the world is that we in the area need to address our own problem and that the unit state is a partner we welcom that obvious and welcom the help assist concern and interest of friend throughout the world i believ that the unit state is in a uniqu posit now shoulder so mani respons the world over so we hope that thei will continu to help to the best of their abil and help us all move toward the establish of a just last peac that we have sought for so long i think sir that in the context of peac again the opportun ar go to be tremend for peopl the world over to benefit from the result of peac on the moral level on the human level on everi level and the area could see us work togeth with our friend here and elsewher in the world in try to bring and succeed in bring about the kind of chang that is in the interest of all our peopl and the futur gener the militari dimens of the problem again is be discuss in negoti at thi stage to creat the kind of balanc that ha to be address to remov the threat of hopefulli in time of weapon of mass destruct wherev thei mai be and to remov the caus for spend so much on militari armament at the expens of everyth els and the need of peopl but the unit state will continu to have a veri veri import role to plai and we hope that we will encourag them to do so realiz at the same time our own respons directli in thi matter unidentifi speaker your majesti i believ i am quot correctli you said that befor the treati is consumm you must negoti that is a model that i believ israel ha tri to enforc in it relat with syria what syria appar want is to have a treati befor the negoti and that ha been a great obstacl becaus the word normal ha been us but nobodi know exactli what normal mean to the syrian and what normal mean to the isra and i wonder becaus as i understand what you have said syria is a part of comprehens peac for the region and i d like veri much for you to comment on syria s posit with regard to ani futur peac treati with israel husayn i can t speak for the syrian nor would i presum to do so but i am in constant touch with them and i believ that the recent statement that we have heard ar a reflect of what i know person and thei have gone far more than ha ever been the case there in the past in term of clariti and in term of a real determin to also seek the goal that all of us ar seek so i hope word indistinct that the come phase will see some real progress regard the syrian isra dimens regard the lebanes isra dimens and certainli as far as we ar concern i think we ar just about to start onc again todai in fact laughter unidentifi speaker mai i sir first of all thank you for thi opportun to speak with you for your candor and mai we all be present with you when you have achiev the crown achiev as you have describ it ratifi the peac treati and mai it be soon husayn that is our hope god will sir

on 242 and 338 that call for negoti amongst the parti the handshak that were wit by the world were inde of tremend signific and import and i believ thei tore down mani wall and mani obstacl in the

and dealt with and resolv culmin in the establish of peac we did so shortli after the event that took place the dai befor becaus we were consist sinc 1974 recogn the palestinian right and the plo right to repres them regard their fate and their futur and their caus on their nation soil although it took us by surpris we could not but be true to ourselv and therefor we also recogn the fact that what took place on that date wa an act of great wisdom and great courag on both side and in support of it we could have move befor but we did not becaus we want to see progress on the palestinian track with israel what is the futur we ar just about start anoth round of talk here in washington and i hope that it will produc tangibl result we start from the same point in madrid we in jordan have alwai support palestinian regard their right on their soil final thei act on their own thei will continu to have our full support in ani wai that we can provid for the need of the time ahead we and the palestinian the syrian the lebanes all start at the same point and i believ in the veri recent past a veri import develop wa the meet that took place a short while ago in switzerland between presid clinton and presid hafiz al asad of syria i have known presid al asad over mani mani year and i firmli believ that there is a convict amongst veri mani that he is a man of hi word my feel in the recent past and now is on of hope not onli hope but hope substanti by reason of contact and coordin to the best of our abil with all the other parti involv in thi conflict and in particular syria i believ that what we will see in the immedi futur is rapid progress hopefulli in address all the problem on all the track a question is ask by some what of jordan jordan believ and strive for a comprehens peac in the region but in term of the fact jordan is now engag in address all the item all the subject that will be the core of the effort hopefulli of jordan and israel to try to resolv and that formul or form the joint agenda some have suggest that i should on thi visit at a meet with a top isra offici ratifi a peac treati my feel is that a peac treati is the crown achiev and must be of resolv all the differ problem that ar there and i hope that rapid progress will be made to enabl us to reach that point befor long i hope that we will see progress on all the other track as well but we ar hopefulli the master of our own destini and let me be veri clear and unequivoc in state befor you befor the skeptic that our final goal is a peac treati with israel if we can resolv and when we can resolv all the problem that we ar now address in the negoti that ar begin and hopefulli will be ongo we have said also that we would be more than happi to see implement of whatev we agre upon not to wait till the end we have a feel that we have to sensit peopl on both side to what peac mean to the chang that is occur jordanian territori must return to jordanian sovereignti but onc that happen and in a context of peac we can look at the entir rift vallei as an econom unit and on of promis for all in term of the potenti to develop the resourc and benefit from them to the largest possibl extent by all concern anoth area is water that is import to us all and we must work out a wai satisfactori to all in term of the fair of the distribut of what is avail and i believ that what is avail is not enough for all the need of peopl befor too long in our region but in the context of peac other sourc can be har and the need of peopl can be address and obvious an area which is veri veri import is that of the human dimens of the problem we feel that it is of utmost import that peopl in the occupi territori should receiv the greatest possibl attent and that the time ahead with progress in implement agreement between israel and the palestinian peopl should immedi see the begin of a chang in the qualiti of life we hope beyond that other elsewher will need to also feel the chang as you know jordan ha born the brunt of the result of everi disast that occur in the entir region jordan ha been the home of jordanian whether thei be of palestinian origin or from whichev part of the arab world thei mai be and our posit is still the same all the member of the jordanian famili will continu to enjoi equal right in our countri and hopefulli equal opportun to develop in the time ahead and to live in the kind of environ that ha not been possibl so far i know mani of you have look at the region and worri about us all over mani year but it is a terribl situat when peopl don t know what each dai would bring the strain the effort the uncertainti the hope that thi will chang so all in jordan will remain member of the on famili proud of our reborn democraci of the nation charter that wa put togeth by all school of polit thought in our countri of the grow pride of the peopl of jordan in their achiev of their determin to partak in shape their futur of respect for human right respect for human right in jordan and hopefulli within the region of the model of the exampl that thi small countri in a veri critic area hopefulli can be to other until such time when other mai have the opportun to return or be compens or whatev their choic mai be there have been mani promis regard the region in the context of peac so far i believ the opportun that will be present themselv

inde involv in sort out the issu on the tabl with israel it wa not lose sight of it object of a comprehens settlement to the overal middl east conflict the king s comment effect quash media suggest that jordan and israel were close to finalis a peac agreement the king said we ar work in regard to our own sphere we ar try to see at the same that we encourag movement on all other track and i believ problem elsewher ar probabl less than thei ar as thei affect us becaus jordan ha born the brunt of everi disast that ha occur over the year and the heaviest of weight so we have a long wai to go but i hope that with goodwil on either side isra and jordanian we will see rapid progress i hope it will come togeth some time king husayn call for an interfaith dialogu to determin sovereignti over the christian jewish and islam holi place in jerusalem king husayn suggest it wa time to move the issu outsid the polit equat the king repeat the arab posit that israel must return the arab portion of jerusalem to their control he said there wa a need to consid mayb for the first time in our histori in the region the possibl of an interfaith dialogu on possibl the sovereignti over these holi place mayb the follow of the three great religion can come to realis what the signififc of jerusalem is to all of them and move it outsid the polit equat he said ask for hi concept of the fruit of a middl east peac king husayn said it hold the promis of an entir differ futur the talent that ar avail the resourc that ar avail the opportun that ar avail i believ will transform the entir region he said he also said that peac could bring about the remov of mani barrier particularli to trade sai it could produc what he call middl east nafta the king said he ha no hangup about meet with isra prime minist yitzhaq rabin i hope that an opportun will aris he said but ad that he did not expect such a meet to take place in the immedi futur our peopl ar meet we ar negoti it is onli normal that such a meet will take place the king said while pose for photograph with us secretari of state warren christoph earlier at the press brief the king said the meet would have to be properli prepar so that it could accomplish someth it s normal when move toward peac that peopl meet he said on jordan s relat with the gulf state particularli with saudi arabia he said as far as jordan is concern we have alwai had if you take it that wai i have been a follow of my grandfath and hi late majesti king abd al aziz bin sa ud who came togeth and settl their differ and left us the respons to work togeth as member of on famili in the interest of our nation our relat have pass through a period i think that there ar so mani aspect that have to be address and could be address when we ar abl to meet face to face as i have tri sinc the outset as far as we ar concern we ar most anxiou to see the relat return to their warmth and to be base on mutual confid and trust and to be base on the desir to cooper in the interest of the arab nation as a whole i hope the time will come and i think we ar move in the right direct and i believ when we have a chanc to meet we will discov that it wa a veri seriou storm in a teacup and i hope that our brethren in saudi arabia will realis that we never meant them ani harm nor did we caus them ani harm at all on iraq and the continu un sanction on that countri the king said i have alwai said that i hope that thi nightmar will come to an end sometim veri soon and particularli as it impact on the iraqi peopl and their continu suffer under the prevail condit somehow i hope we will get out of the area of iraq not be an activ construct part of the arab world and the commun of nation as soon as possibl he said hi version of peac wa peac a real peac a peac that give everybodi the opportun to work togeth and to achiev their hope for the futur and i spoke in detail about some of the problem that we have to address a as publish the problem of occupi territori and i am talk of jordanian occupi territori without prejudic to what our palestinian brethren ar talk about right now and i have state categor that in that regard we feel veri veri strongli that these area the small problem in the north of the jordan vallei but there is a consider area in the southern jordan vallei that need to be look at in the sens of the urgenc of our demand that jordanian territori be return to us so there is the suggest and hopefulli movement on creat a group that will look at delin and demarc of the border and i hope that the come dai will see some progress here and peopl can move on the ground there onc that is settl and it ha to mean the return of jordanian territori to jordanian sovereignti then we can look at the entir rift vallei and look at what can be done in the context of look at it as a complet econom unit in term of resourc in term of all the potenti that there is to develop into the best wai possibl to the benefit of all so the question of border and territori and sovereignti over our territori is on of the aspect that ha to be address anoth area is water and there again i believ that all the avail resourc might not be adquat for the need of all concern in the futur but certainli we have to work out the distribut of these water in a satisfactori wai in term of the percentag that ar peopl right beyond that hopefulli in a context of peac we can look at what can be done beyond that to secur need water for all concern and obvious the third dimens and thi is not all becaus there ar mani other item on the agenda is the human dimens sentenc punctuat as publish there ha to be a qualit chang of life i would hope that the prioriti will be given to peopl in the occupi territori but beyond that the region for everybodi to feel what peac is to know that peac is to realis what transform there is as we progress along to it attain i am realli optimist and that is my tendenc of cours i can never be absolut certain that thing will work the wai we wish but i think that there is a gener concensu amongst the overwhelm major of peopl that we move toward resolv problem i hope palestinian on their soil will enjoi democraci and plural respect for human right and a chanc to live and work with us and i hope that jordan and palestin eventu can be an exampl to other in the entir region in repli to a question on an assert in a book written by an isra gener in which he said that the king went to israel befor the war of 73 and he warn the isra that the egyptian and syrian will attack them sir when the war of 1973 occur we were not

veri clear to our palestinian brethren that we ar readi to help when we know what is need and when we ar approach and when we reach agreement with them over ani subject of interest but in term of the

have to move with convict toward the establish of peac we provid the umbrella for the joint deleg we enabl our palestinian brethren to speak for themselv and we went to moscow and we have attend everi

palestinian recogn each other and met here in the citi of washington outsid the white hous we saw that handshak that will be rememb in the time ahead so the umbrella ha been shut down and releg to the closet of histori but nonetheless we immedi hail what happen as a courag step on both side in term of a vision of the futur and a sens of respons toward gener to come and we immedi on the 14th of septemb ratifi the agenda that we had held up to that time to see some progress on the palestinian track now we ar deal with the agenda and all the item there and i hope we will see some rapid progress in the meantim all the other parti ar involv and engag and it certainli is my hope that what will come out is a comprehens peac at the end but now we ar deal with our own problem and i think that thei ar complex and thei will be demand of time and effort and yet we ar go at our own speed now report some of the palestinian leadership would believ that on of the problem which is secur of jericho and whether palestinian alon will be abl to polic the border between jericho and jordan there is some in the palestinian leadership who suggest that jordan ha object to the idea that palestinian would be abl to control the border by themselv and that jordan made those object known to the unit state and to israel husayn i would like to categor deni that and suggest that it wa veri unfortun that such a suggest should even be made jordan is a state sir jordan ha it border jordan ha it posit on the bridg and jordan continu to have the right to exercis look after it border and it territori we were inform that the oslo agreement stipul that extern secur wa israel s domain for the initi phase we did not comment in ani form or wai we heard what you all heard and obvious if the palestinian ar abl to look after the bridg on their side that is most welcom by us but that is someth that israel and the palestinian have to decid upon it is noth that reflect on us or concern us in ani wai except in the hope that whatev happen will help our brethren in the occupi territori and will make them feel that there is real progress toward a chang a chang in the qualiti of life a chang in condit that have persist for 26 terribl year report word indistinct your majesti could you assess your relationship with the plo leader right now particularli chairman arafat and comment on whether you think it will be natur and inevit for jordan s larg palestinian popul to look for leadership both to your majesti and to the plo husayn as far as we ar concern sir and face all the realiti of todai as we have done in the past we in jordan all jordanian regardless of their origin ar member of on famili that have and will continu to share equal right until such time that ani would wish otherwis or have the opportun to exercis anoth option jordan is uniqu in the arab world in that sens which ha been our approach throughout we will continu to help our brethren to the best our abil in the occupi territori we will continu to hope as we have made it veri veri clear that the leadership of the palestinian will rise to the level of the challeng it face right now we hope and prai that the step that will be taken will lead eventu to the fulfil of palestinian aspir regard palestinian right on palestinian soil in term of democraci plural respect for human right we hope that all will have part in shape the futur both insid and outsid and particularli those who have live through the 26 year of occup and endur them and hung to their land and endur all the difficulti that ar known to all i hope that the palestinian institut will come into be i hope that there will be the potenti for the veri talent palestinian within the region and throughout the world to put their resourc and energi into the come phase so as far as we ar concern we will continu to help in ani wai we can if you ar refer to our relat in term of the futur i hope that thei will be veri clear we will implement whatev we agre upon we will alwai call for cooper coordin to the best of our abil but also we ar go to be veri veri clear if we don t have the kind of coordin that is need we will make it public we cannot assum respons for someth that we ar not involv in regard the futur relationship i believ that thi is someth for peopl to decid in time report your majesti it is obviou from what you just said and in past pronounc publicli and privat that you felt on a number of occas that word indistinct great frustrat becaus of the lack of coordin between you and the plo leadership and particularli with chairman arafat thi is anoth question about the illus coordin among the arab you said that you advis mr arafat publicli and privat to drop the word confeder or confederaci from hi polit lexicon i would like you to expand a littl bit on that and would i be stretch it too much to sai that judg from what you just said you do not believ that the plo leadership ha risen to the occas in other word and if i add on thing is it true also that you ve reach an agreement with presid al asad of syria that jordan and syria and lebanon also will sign peac treati togeth husayn jordan is move syria is move lebanon is move i hope that our object of a comprehens peac will be achiev the palestinian ar move i am not talk about the past i am talk about a critic moment i am talk about the futur and it is certainli my hope that all of us will rise to the level of their respons in term of what is happen and the impact of all that is happen on the futur of the region as a whole we hope relat ar fine sir but as far as confeder mayb the talk about it as a concept wa warrant at a certain point in time to help palestinian reach the point thei have reach and enabl them to speak for themselv as thei ar do and as thei ve done both in oslo and lead on to washington and on to whatev is happen right now but as far as the futur is concern sir we have live in the arab world and we have tri our veri best and between the emot feel about arab uniti and between the setback that we have had our posit is the follow jordan and palestin ar veri veri close togeth we re member of on famili but feder and confeder and whatev cannot be determin by individu and depend on their feel at ani point in time thei ar the sum total of the convict of peopl that thi is the right approach so we re happi to have been abl to help our palestinian brethren to get where thei ar and hopefulli to achiev their object but as close as we ar to them we ll support them to the best of our abil and the futur will have to take care of itself when under condit of freedom and democrat institut ar there when peopl decid and thei can have someth that is meaning that will last and i believ that will come inevit sooner of later so for the time be i ve ask presid arafat to drop thi word from hi vocabulari certainli in talk with me let s get on with it let us work from the grassroot upward let us dispel the fals impress that we had ani object other than help our palestinian brethren recov their right on their soil help them through the veri difficult time that thei have endur so far report your majesti what ar you go to do for

we will certainli do our veri best the timefram i think the wai thing ar move in fact so mani surpris most of them ar pleasant in the recent past hopefulli it mai be the end of thi year it mai be next year but we ar move determinedli and i hope that it will be a comprehens peac as far as jordan and israel ar concern we ar deal with our own problem right now we still have a long wai to go we think that the other track will move and i hope eventu we will be togeth report i have a question for you on iraq did you discuss the situat in iraq with the clinton administr and have you seen ani chang in

the commun of nation as soon as possibl report your majesti you met with a group of jewish leader thi week and it wa veri success meet i heard you talk about a warm peac could you tell us what a warm peac would look like between jordan and israel and what a warm peac in your view would look like in the region husayn i didn t us the express warm peac i think mayb the descript of the meet wa that what i impli a warm peac mai not be a veri pleasant on laughter by report but i talk of peac a real peac the peac that give everybodi the opportun to work togeth and to achiev their hope for the futur and i spoke in detail about some of the problem that we ar to address a the problem of occupi territori and i am talk about jordanian occupi territori without prejudic to what our palestinian brother ar talk about right now and i have state categor that in that regard we feel veri veri strongli that these area the small problem in the north of the jordan vallei but there is a consider area in the southern jordan vallei that need to be look at in the sens of the urgenc of our demand that jordanian territori be return to us so there is the suggest and hopefulli movement on creat a group that will look at delin and demarc of these border and my hope is that the come dai will see some progress here then peopl can move on the ground there onc that is settl and it ha to mean the return of jordanian territori to jordanian sovereignti then we can look at the entir rift vallei and look at what can be done in the context of look at it as a complet econom unit in term of resourc in term of all the potenti that there is to develop to the best wai possibl to the benefit of all so the question of border and territori and sovereignti over our territori is on of the aspect that ha to be address anoth area is water and there again i believ that all the avail resourc might not be adequ for the need of all concern in the futur but certainli we have got to work out the distribut of these water in a satisfactori wai in term of the percentag that ar peopl right beyond that hopefulli in a context of peac we can look at what can be done beyond that to secur need water for all concern and obvious the third dimens and thi is not all becaus i have mani other item on the agenda is the human dimens there ha to be a qualit chang of life i would hope that the prioriti will be given to peopl in the occupi territori but beyond that the region for everybodi to feel what peac is to know what peac is to realiz what transform there is as we progress along to it end report your majesti for mani year you have fear in jordan that the isra would do someth that would lead to anoth massiv influx of palestinian refuge from the territori ar you worri about that happen under palestinian control in the territori for on reason or anoth either civil war or econom breakdown and have you done anyth to husayn interrupt laugh word indistinct have you woken up on the wrong side of bed thi morn laugh word indistinct excus my be so person but let s look at the posit side let s not talk about disast and thing that i hope will not report interrupt your majesti jordan ha surviv for mani year becaus you anticip word indistinct disast word indistinct husayn interrupt i don t anticip hopefulli ani more i am realli optimist and that is my tendenc of cours on can never be absolut certain that thing would work the wai we wish but i think that there is a gener consensu amongst the overwhelm major of peopl that we move toward resolv problem i hope palestinian on their soil will enjoi democraci plural respect for human right and the chanc to live and work with us and i hope that jordan and palestin eventu can be an exampl to other in the entir region report your majesti your express your hope for a comprehens peac among all parti word indistict work togeth but can you forese circumst under which jordan would sign a peac treati with israel move ahead of syria and lebanon husayn i would certainli hope that it will be a comprehens peac i believ that we ar work toward that end we ar coordin with our syrian brethren we ar coordin with our lebanes brethren we ar coordin with our palestinian brethren we ar coordin with egypt to the best of our abil there ar mani subject that ar be discuss but we slow down until our palestinian brethren made their move it wa veri veri import to see the palestinian dimens the root caus of the bigger problem in the region and the world wa address thei ve assum the respons as thei wish sinc 1974 and we ve recogn that wa the wai thing should move and then that made their move now we ar try to help them we ar try to resolv our own problem i believ that there ar enough subject that must be cover befor we arriv at ratifi a peac treati my own impress is that the time element will bring everyth togeth almost at the same time so that s how we ar move we ar not try to have a race we re try to address problem so that we resolv them onc and for all so that peopl can enjoi peac in the region we re not paus we re master of our own destini we re work in regard to our own sphere we re try to see at the same time that we encourag movement on all other track and i believ that problem elsewher ar probabl less than thei ar as thei affect us becaus jordan ha born the brunt of everi disast that ha occur over the year and the heaviest of weight so we have a long wai to go but i hope with good will on either side isra and jordanian we ll see rapid progress word indistinct report word indistinct your majesti you ve spoken optimist about peac could you give us a more specif timet of when jordan and israel could reach a peac agreement ar we talk about month ar we talk about by the end of 1994 husayn i can t sir how can i give you a timet it doe not depend on me it depend also on the isra side and i hope that at least as far as we ar concern right now the isra partner in the negoti will realiz that instead of spend too much time on look at how we can sign a piec of paper and call it a peac treati and then negoti it let us get to negoti i believ that thi is happen and therefor i hope that it won t take long befor we discuss all the

left to us to look after sinc 1974 by the arab summit but there is an idea that we ve been try to put across and that is the need to consid mayb for the first time in our histori within the region the possibl through someth that is happen and we have encourag and been involv in for some period of time interfaith dialogu between the three great religion but beyond that possibl the sovereignti over all these holi place and the fact that in our view we believ that we will not recogn ani sovereignti over them except to god i hope that somehow in the context of peac thi problem can be address and mayb the follow of the three great religion can come to realiz what the signific of jerusalem is to all of them and move it outsid the polit equat move the holi place outsid that particular dimens we refer to the hashemit and their respons who continu to shoulder them we hope and we ar suggest that a non polit islam represent can be found that would assum our respons or that we would support

work to have a group repres all differ school which we will support as much as we can in order to achiev what we aspir for in term of give jerusalem it spiritu dimens thi citi is in our heart and

terror act plan at the headquart of abu jihad khalil al wazir in the jordanian capit to threaten to bombard the terrorist headquart in amman ha israel under pere and rabin begun to adopt such an

the dome of the rock on the templ mount in the not too distant past israel support such develop ha israel chang it stand and is it no longer interest in an improv in jordan s statu in the territori the answer to thi question too is neg the fact is that israel ha help jordan rehabilit it bank system in the territori and cooper with it in frustrat palestinian attempt to set up their own central bank and issu their own currenc israel is coordin the new arrang at the cave of the patriarch with jordan not with the plo it mai well be that the affair should be taken at face valu a bleed israel could not toler a situat in which hama spokesmen brag about their murder act from well protect offic in amman and even threaten to continu them and yet with regard to isra jordanian cooper on sever issu pertain to the negoti with the palestinian it is hard to ignor sever unpleas aspect of the relat between the two countri which culmin in the isra warn to it eastern neighbor in gener the rehabilit of jordan s statu in the territori come at the expens of the oslo agreement the less glamor the agreement seem the stronger jordan s statu becom israel ha notic that jordan ha been establish allianc with palestinian circl that oppos the agreement amman ha becom a center of conspiraci and intrigu against arafat it is no accid that for exampl when the member of the plo execut committe were summon to tuni last month thei prefer to meet in jordan therebi demonstr that arafat did not have a major to ratifi the cairo agreement amman also host contact the palestinian peopl s parti and fida palestinian democrat feder conduct with the democrat and popular front for the liber of palestin head by habash and hawatimah the contact sought to establish a new palestinian polit apparatu to replac the align of forc that support the oslo agreement at the outset the contact fail but israel resent them nonetheless behind them li the fact that although jordan support the oslo agreement in word it is veri worri by them and is work to thwart them in deed thi is the reason for jordan s cooper with syria israel view the tighten jordan syria relat as conflict with the approach israel would expect jordan to adopt at thi time jordan recent consid replac the govern under abd al salam al majali with a new govern head by zayd al rifa i al majali ha been identifi with the madrid confer and the peac process sinc it earli dai while al rifa i more than ani other jordanian politician is identifi with syria it can be assum that on of the reason husayn eventu decid against turn the domest tabl around wa us and isra pressur nevertheless the pro syrian line is begin to have a neg effect on jordanian polici for exampl in the previou round of talk in washington israel expect practic discuss on the water issu while jordan surpris it by rais imposs demand such as determin the borderlin at thi time husayn s demand that the blockad on the al aqabah port be lift as a precondit for jordan s particip in the next round of washington talk coincid with the rapproch between the jordanian and the syrian attitud at the same time it seem that the blockad busi also attest to a jordanian attempt to counterbal it rapproch with syria by reserv the option of strike an allianc with iraq in due time a veri special develop in term of the relat between israel and jordan is seen in israel s relat with the gulf emir it is worth note that while israel sent a larg deleg to oman jordan sent a small technic deleg practic adopt the syrian polici of boycot the multilater talk thi is a major neg develop becaus jordan plai an import role in convinc oman to accept an isra deleg despit tension between the hashemit and the oil emir of the gulf jordan and oman have good relat in principl jordan s retreat from the peac process accord to it origin paramet stem from it submiss to syrian influenc at the same time on should studi jordan s polici toward the gulf for sign of jordanian fear of isra involv there while live under a heavi iranian threat the emir cannot trust iraq or saudi arabia it is an unknown fact that until the kuwait crisi some of the gulf emir trust jordan as the militari forc that could to some extent help them in the face of the iranian threat jordanian offic train and advis the armi of the emir and sever jordanian armi unit were station in the gulf jordan s role there came to an end when it chose to strike an allianc with yemen and iraq thu lose the trust of the emir jordan is current engag in an effort to bolster it statu in the gulf at the same time the isra connect with the emir began to take shape obvious the emir will seek to examin the extent to which the peac process success complet can provid them with isra protect against the iranian threat thi is what li at the veri root of iran s interest in do as much damag as possibl to the peac process the real struggl is over secur arrang in the gulf as will be recal the gulf state reject offer from egypt and syria to take part in secur arrang becaus thei did not trust the two countri jordan recent start explor the option of reviv it old statu in the gulf and along come israel as an undesir competitor the wai thing look now there appear to be an isra jordanian competit over the gulf but thi mai not necessarili lead to a crisi the fact is that jordan initi support israel s particip in the oman confer should isra jordanian relat evolv into a joint confeder with the palestinian the emir could be convinc that such a confeder is not against them meanwhil matter between israel and jordan have taken a neg turn mainli becaus israel is displeas with what it believ ar jordanian attempt to frustrat the negoti with the plo two neg landmark ar worth mention in thi regard on is the failur of foreign minist pere talk with king husayn late last year husayn not onli fail to speed up the talk as pere had hope he even held them up the second is jordan s evad pressur from pere to conven the big new middl east econom confer in novemb jordanian crown princ hasan said in an interview to beirut s al safir that he felt humili by the white hous public meet with pere which had been forc on him pere becam convinc that jordan would not budg without syria but nevertheless appar still recommend put pressur on the jordanian syrian connect in order to remov an import bargain card from al asad anoth refer point wa husayn s failur to meet king fahd two month ago when he had reason to believ that the saudi monarch would receiv him after the umra pilgrimag which he did not make dure the hajj period king husayn wa upset and return to amman deepli offend he is convinc that the american at israel s behest convinc king fahd to reject hi outstretch hand paradox husayn s humili might now promot hi relat with fahd we

the meantim howev husayn feel a need to get back at the unit state and israel the pressur and counter pressur endang the peac process and the intern stabil of the state in the region the isra threat to jordan reveal the basic disput between jordan and egypt over the islam terrorist struggl we should note that compar to presid mubarak who ha come out openli against the islam extremist king husayn tri to appeas them although thei also threaten hi regim husayn ha on sever occas come out against islam extremist and said that thei ar not true islam which is an enlighten and progress religion but the king did not hand down to the jordanian armi order like those mubarak gave the egyptian armi in it struggl against the islam extremist the differ approach by jordan and egypt on that matter make it hard for mubarak becaus husayn present a differ exampl of how to treat the islam problem we can assum that mubarak tri to convinc husayn to adopt the egyptian model of the struggl against the

dealt with todai were the current peac negoti we current notic that the peac process ha begun to take a new direct it import and strateg role in the peac process notwithstand jordan cannot agre to lag much behind other track at the same time jordan is not show breathless and hasti jordan doe not want to find itself god forbid in a posit forc it to adopt posit that it doe not at all accept for

that we keep on soliloqu until the jordanian role becom margin in the peac process therefor regard the peac process jordan will take the step which will enabl it to maintain the rein of the initi with respect to jordanian affair among the most import issu in thi regard is the tripartit jordanian us isra meet which will begin in washington on mondai 6 june the main object of thi meet is to discuss the futur of the negoti as you know jordan sign a joint agenda with israel on 14 septemb 1993 immedi after the palestinian isra declar of principl wa sign thi wa done out of jordan s support for the palestinian negoti posit at that time in fact the agenda we obtain wa good in the full sens of the word becaus it preserv both jordan s basic right and the comprehens solut the agenda also address all issu rais at the negoti tabl thu in the negoti process jordan basic follow the agenda it sign at that time we know that jordan ha basic issu pertain to the negoti process these issu ar current led by the issu of border or the so call occupi jordanian territori and also the need to proce toward regain it thi is becaus the agenda specifi the principl to which we can refer in order to regain the jordanian territori as you know the term of refer on defin thi territori ar the mandat agreement of 1922 thu there should be an agreement under which israel will be commit to both return the jordanian territori and accept the set up of an expert committe which would demarc these border as thei us to be accord to the mandat agreement moreov jordan must demand it right to water thi is becaus as you know water is a jordanian right accord to israel regardless of divid the water it size would not be suffici for the futur so instead of discuss the right to water let us talk about both increas the water resourc and the region cooper on them we in jordan howev believ that both issu ar veri import so we will not relinquish our right to water henc we should complet what the water energi and environ group in the bilater negoti began in term of discuss the subsidiari agenda of thi group so we can take step later to regain our full right to water now if someth take place in washington confirm that the isra side is more prepar to demarc the jordanian border accord to the mandat agreement and if we find out that thei ar readi to serious discuss return water right to jordan the follow logic question would be pose what will our posit be on such a basic develop which jordan ha been push to achiev sinc the begin of the peac process a clear answer to thi question is that jordan will not stand idli by and defer the regain of it right to both the territori and water in return for procedur or some form of arrang to hold negoti on thi issu it is clear that we cannot demarc the border and specifi our water share in washington dc henc there should be an arrang to move the negoti process to thi region so we can be close to the decisionmak and the committe can meet on site in order to defin both the jordanian territori and jordan s water share which we deserv within thi context jordan ha an unshak belief that ani settlement must be inclus that a settlement must be inclus is not just a demand or slogan as far as jordan is concern it must translat into practic step on the ground we veri much want to see progress on the syrian track obvious the golan height ar syrian territori that must all be hand back to syria ani isra withdraw in return for ani reciproc measur that syria mai take will be view by us as suffici to direct the peac process toward the eventu return of syria s right in the golan we ar also awar that isra offici have said that thei have no design on lebanes territori here in jordan we ar vigor behind the demand that the lebanes govern regain sovereignti over

by event and left behind lest it hand becom ti and it movement toward it object be hinder not onli in term of jordanian right but also in term of arab right in the sens that the peac process must be comprehens and peac itself durabl we therefor do not rush into take hasti step we will take step when the time is right so jordan s role remain clear thi is becaus as you know ani peac settlement in

when condit ar ripe peopl under condit of total freedom can work togeth to defin that relationship thi hasn t happen so far so it is prematur to realli defin the wai these relat will be formul but as far as your question regard the peac process we start at the same point in time and i believ that as far as amman and damascu ar concern we have alwai been in touch and in term of matter relat to polici thi ha been discuss time and again between me and the presid of syria presid al asad so my visit there wa natur within that context and we were negoti thei were negoti there i hope that eventu all these track will see activ movement toward the object of have a comprehens peac in the region but as far as we ar concern we will be as fast or as slow as we ar abl to achiev real progress in resolv all the problem that ar there on the agenda and between us and israel and i hope that thei will approach the come negoti with a construct seriou word indistinct for we will move rapidli i can t set a time or i realli don t know but i realli hope that we will see rapid progress in that regard correspond your majesti on thi question you said that you discuss thi matter with mr al asad doe thi

everi now and then that someon complain about anoth leav him alon but thi hasn t happen at the veri level i wa discuss i believ that presid al asad and i understand each other veri veri well i know of hi concern to see syria move toward achiev the kind of peac that it can live with and that he know that we ar do the same so in the area of coordin i d like to sai there ha never been the kind of coordin that will enabl us to know exactli where ani track is at ani given movement we have our own peculiar set of circumst and problem that we try to address and the syrian have the same as do the lebanes our brethren therefor movement as far as we concern is a question of a sovereign matter regard jordan itself and there is noth to do nor is it ti to movement on other track we hope that thei will catch us and mai be thei will overtak us in time if thei so desir but that is someth which we can t control it someth that thei can control correspond your majesti word indistinct trip wa report that you and presid al asad suggest word indistinct uniti jordan and syria will word indistinct syrian idea word indistinct husayn no sir we have alwai work for complementar and the closest possibl cooper between jordan and syria and lebanon hopefulli and certainli with egypt and there wa a meet of a prime ministeri commiss with egypt that wa reviv again just a short while ago and in the same context there wa go to be a meet with syria so thi wa postpon but essenti thi would have dealt with issu other than the polit on that usual ar dealt with between me and my brother presid al asad correspond your high on your talk with the american did you make ani headwai on the request to resel word indistinct and also your request to purchas addit american militari equip and lastli final the arrang for the land base inspect system word indistinct naval blockad the gulf of aqaba husayn i haven t had the chanc to cover all these point with ani detail but we ar as jordan is concern look at the moment that the present situat and the futur in term of hopefulli reorgan of our arm forc to meet the challeng and the demand of the come period both in term of the defens of jordan and also in term of the role that we plai on the intern arena particularli in the area of troop that ar with the unit nation and have beeen over a period of time so we have idea and plan and we hope that we will be abl discuss them with our friend to modern and reorgan our arm forc in time ahead correspond so thi time you ll be discuss mainli word indistinct husayn i am not discuss anyth in particular i am just give you an idea of where we ar at the moment we haven t formul our plan total but obvious we discuss our requir with our friend from time to time correspond your majesti word indistinct husayn thi is not someth that is on of word indistinct replac in the futur then we ll have to see what we replac them with and what we do with them but thi is someth that i am not prepar to answer at thi stage it is someth that we will be discuss with our friend in the time ahead correspond your majesti word indistinct the peac process at thi stage do you think it is revers particularli in term of circumst such as for exampl the likud take over the isra govern in such circumst do you think it could the clock be turn back to where the middl east wa three year ago husayn i certainli hope not and i believ that the process is irrevers and we ar certainli commit to move ahead toward the establish of a just comprehens peac in that region thi is someth that we feel we ar close to but it s word indistinct to requir the best effort of all concern we ar look forward to see some rapid progress on the jordanian isra track and we hope that thi will be the case with the other track as well correspond word indistinct that the american could be do right now to further the peac process husayn thei have been involv with the process thei have sponsor the process thei have i am sure help us veri veri much inde to get to thi point and i hope that their involv will continu in the time ahead correspond your majesti how do you forese jordan s relat with israel after an agreement is sign do you think it will be word indistinct for jordanian in term of econom and word indistinct husayn as far as that goe i believ obvious that if we arriv at a state of peac it would be a chang of everyth that we ve had to live with and endur over mani mani year it will be to the benefit of peopl in both jordan and in israel and in the whole region particularli if the circl is enlarg to includ all involv in the conflict so far as far as we re concern these come negoti and why in place there ar as you know within the area of grave concern for us ar territori right sentenc as heard the border between us and israel is not clearli settl yet in term of an issu that is veri veri import to us to regain our sovereignti over the area that ar occupi by israel in southern jordan at thi stage so the question of border demarc and delin is veri veri import not to creat a new barrier but in the context of movement toward peac we hope that the rift vallei the vallei itself will becom the vallei of peac the vallei of opportun for cooper in mani field and mani area anoth area of cours is of import to us and that is the question of water and our right and our share in that plu the environ plu all the other subject that have to be discuss so what we ar try to do right now is hopefulli approach a seriou phase of negoti to resolv all these problem word indistinct the qualiti of life of peopl affect them in term of their hope and aspir and the opportun that will be the result fact of all these effort which have been ongo so far correspond your majesti you mention move quickli between jordan and israel and that there is no link between the jordanian track and the other track when you finish the negoti on the agenda would you be readi to sign even if the other track ar not progress husayn our posit on that is not link to anyth that mai or mai not happen on ani other track what i am sai is that what we ar search for is a comprehens peac and therefor on would obvious stress the need for progress on all track so that we achiev thi comprehens peac for exampl in regard to jordanian palestinian relat in time ahead we in jordan will continu to respond to ani demand for help in ani particular area but let us sai we take the area of econom dimens the economi as between us and our palestinian brethren and israel if coordin ha not achiev veri much then obvious we have to negoti thi subject as jordan togeth with the palestinian and the isra in the time ahead in other word there ar bilater negoti and trilater negoti and there ar go to be quadrilater negoti with regard to egypt for exampl in term of the return of palestinian to the occupi territori you can t resolv the question of water without hopefulli see progress everywher but the point is our wish for progress to be achiev on all track howev we ar a sovereign countri we ar deal with our own problem we start at the same point and we ar try to see what we can achiev whether we will or not doe not depend on ani other factor other than israel s come through with the same kind of spirit and our mutual reach a satisfactori conclus to the differ between us as settl all the item of the agenda correspond will we see a peac treati thi year your majesti husayn i can t tell you that i can t tell you that correspond your majesti you were quot yesterdai as sai that you would agre to talk to isra leader as you have indic in the past todai thei ar respond sai thei would like to meet with you do you forese that thi peac process the talk begin next month would lead to or conclud in some final a public meet between you and isra leader husayn whenev the time is ripe whenev there is a need to i welcom that there is no problem with that at all correspond your majesti can you confirm for us whether you saw the isra leadership pleas husayn i am not go to comment on press specul in that regard or media specul on wai or the other i think you have had their answer so thi is my answer too correspond your majesti word indistinct concern the syrian critic directli or indirectli after husayn interrupt let me ask a question myself to all of you is jordan expect to be the last to ratifi a peac treati correspond i thought everybodi would sign it within the same timefram husayn inshallah inshallah that is what we hope will happen but to get there we have to begin negoti and thi is precis what we ar do so i hope that these seriou negoti will achiev some result correspond your majesti will you explain pleas and shed some light what made you feel that thi wa the right moment to go forward on the road that eventu will end in a peac husayn that wa not our do but i think word indistinct suggest sinc the outset that we have to translat the item on the agenda into realiti by negoti over them and that a peac treati is a crown achiev of resolv all the problem so we have been wait but when the isra were readi to begin i think we have seen some progress it wa not anyth that wa a result of our hesit or an attempt to avoid the issu correspond i mean were there ani histor moment you thought that thi is the right moment to go for husayn not at all sir we weren t plai tactic we were wait and readi and the moment ha arriv so we were begin to work out correspond your majesti you mention someth about the water right which the isra have been deni refus to discuss water right befor and final thei did thi washington word indistinct did thi washington word indistinct contribut to make progress on the jordanian track you went back to the begin of the establish of israel from 1948 to 1951 israel receiv 600 000 immigr and thi caus a seriou water shortag in israel as a result israel start to divert jordan river in the whole sequenc of event that led to the june 1967 war ar you concern now about the wave of immigr come from russia that word indistinct more than 430 000 alreadi arriv on the ground in israel thi is appar caus a seriou threat and shortag of water in israel itself ar you concern that you ll be paus do you see that thi on is on of the reason for mayb the isra move toward peac and do you see a new threat on the arab water becaus of the new immigr husayn i hope that the question of water resourc avail in the region will be resolv to the satisfact of all but on the other hand i would like to sai that it s my feel that befor too long even all these resourc that ar avail will not be enough to meet the demand and the need of all so water is a veri veri import subject an import need for everyon in the region and that again is a reason for us to move ahead becaus amongst the mani reason we have to resolv thi problem that could be veri explos unless resolv and cannot be resolv except in the context of peac correspond the isra your majesti ar suggest that as the word indistinct under the johnston plan i think thei have inde receiv more water than thei were allot to or that thei ve stolen if you want to us the word more water ha that been commun to you that there is go to be an arrang under which larg quantiti of water ar restor to jordan husayn i certainli hope that we will receiv our share and that thi will be defin in the come negoti sir correspond but sir if i can just ask you anoth question i know you can t speak for the syrian leadership but from your talk in damascu do you have ani sens of what the major problem is now for the syrian there seem to be as you know secretari christoph ha put off hi trip to the region becaus he wa not convinc that it will produc progress on the syrian isra track do you have ani thought about what mai be requir either from the isra or from the syrian to try to produc progress husayn my impress is that progress wa made and that certainli reflect my impress of the syrian posit that thei would like to get on with it as rapidli as possibl and arriv at a satisfactori conclus to these talk i think that posit were set out and thei probabl ar start posit at thi stage but i hope that on both side there will be an effort to achiev progress and i hope that we will see that happen in the time ahead it is not for me to comment on when the secretari will visit but i think that further progress is expect befor too long correspond your majesti on the question of jerusalem it seem no on is talk about jerusalem ani more is jerusalem go to be just a palestinian isra issu especi that the palestinian will not have ani leverag on husayn interrupt not in the least not in the least the agenda word indistinct that i don t know mayb you have not been hear us i think that we ve been talk about jerusalem continu and our feel for jerusalem have never chang will never chang and again the idea that we ar try to put across is that we should somehow find a wai by which we can address the problem in term of the holi site holi to the follow of the three great monotheist religion the three great ibrahm religion to remov those awai from the realm of polit and politick and we recogn no sovereignti over these holi place except to god we hope that in a state of peac these place will come to symbol peac between the follow of the three great religion and as far as the rest is concern i believ 242 appli to that side of the equat and i am sure that futur negoti we understand will deal with them correspond your majesti permit me to ask about yemen mainli it is anoth subject but still you have a posit and your posit is veri well known concern yemen now we have reach thi phase of problem where there is actual war and there is no ceas fire what is the jordanian posit what is your posit your majesti on thi problem husayn sir our posit is on of deep regret over see the situat in yemen develop to the point of war and militari action we regret the loss those who have been lost in term of the ongo struggl and those who have suffer and those who continu to face a threat within yemen we had tri our utmost to help all yemeni achiev an understand of how the state of yemen will be formul in the futur and thei have reach an agreement which thei ratifi repres of all school of polit thought and repres of all the peopl of yemen in amman unfortun it did not last long and the situat ha erupt natur it would be our wish and hope that the uniti of yemen could be maintain but i am veri concern and veri veri worri that even that might be in jeopardi at thi stage i hope somehow that the situat will improv and that what is in the interest of yemen will be in the forefront of the thought of all concern correspond your majesti you ve said that get back to the face to face meet with the isra leadership you ve said that word indistinct must wait word indistinct until the time is right the isra leadership ha been us similar languag what is the sequenc of provision agreement on variou issu that must be achiev befor time is right for a face to face meet or is it necessari to wait until all agreement ar agre husayn interrupt sir let s put it in anoth wai i think that it s fair to describ the situat in the follow wai we ar negoti negoti ar take place negoti ar go to take place so whether thei ar at my level and the prime minist or at the level of our repres at thi stage on and the same thing the question of exactli when we will meet hopefulli we ll see some progress befor that happen but the fact that we haven t met publicli doe not mean that the effort of our colleagu and those who repres both countri ar not a reflect of the spirit and the desir to negoti between the two as is happen correspond your majesti regard the venu for such a confer such a meet within the area will it also be in the region word indistinct husayn it could be why not correspond it could be in the region husayn it could be i suppos correspond your majesti just to clear up on thing ar you draw a distinct between the start of negoti with the isra and the sign of the agreement becaus sometim we ar put them togeth husayn i think sir that thi is a problem in the mind of mani i mean obvious it is a veri import moment and we ar start seriou negoti at thi stage hopefulli with good will and with a determin to achiev progress and resolv all problem that doesn t mean we have ratifi peac yet but when we reach satisfact on all the problem when we ve resolv all these problem then obvious we will be at the state where the crown achiev as i ve said time and again is a peac treati correspond your majesti have you detect ani flexibl in the american posit on sanction on iraq is there ani chang in the american posit husayn i do not care to comment on that sir i haven t paus anyth that i would sai would be out of place i think correspond could i just follow that up your majesti on iraq there is an agreement between jordan an econom agreement between jordan and the plo to provid oil to the gaza and jericho the self rule area jordan get about 60 000 barrel a dai of oil from iraq presum if jordan is go to provid oil to those area it is go to be iraqi oil and it is go to come from the oil that you need for your countri doesn t that creat an incent for you and inde for the west in gener to relook at the sanction and perhap provid some relief for the iraqi to at least provid some oil or greater quantiti of oil jordanian prime minist al majali whisper to king husayn in arab after husayn queri him there is an agreement between israel and egypt and we have noth to do with that husayn we have not yet conclud an agreement sir with our palestinian brethren to provid oil from jordan and as you do suggest i wa just ask if there is anyth new that ha happen while i wa awai but i don t think that anyth ha in that regard but regard iraq i continu to feel veri veri strongli with the peopl of iraq and i hope that the rest of the world will share with us these feel that the impact the suffer of the peopl of iraq is realli out of proport to all reason regardless of who is respons regardless of who caus it and regardless of as heard we ar interest obvious in the humanitarian dimens and iraq is an import element in our region so let us hope that thi nightmar somehow come to an end befor too long correspond your majesti could you sai someth about the demarc of border between you and israel word indistinct doe jordan want thi to be the first thing on the agenda do you think it will be a problem with the isra becaus thei alwai reject husayn interrupt i hope that it will not be a problem and i hope that paus i think that we ar go to meet face to face i am sure the american will be present and most welcom at thi stage and as far as we ar concern obvious the question of sovereignti over our territori is on that ha to be resolv and as i have said earlier by that i don t mean that we should creat a new barrier between us but we have to recov our territori we have to recov our water right let me put it anoth wai to those who ask so mani question about jordan and jordan s action and why i think no countri in the arab world ha done more for the palestinian caus or identifi more with the suffer of the palestinian peopl or their hope and aspir of regain their right on their soil no arab countri ha done more for arab uniti and cooper and coordin we paid a veri heavi price in 1967 becaus we live up to our commit as member of the arab leagu and we respect our agreement in term of the joint defens dimens within the arab world we knew fulli well what the result might be yet we live up to our commit and we endur all the result as hard as thei have been later we saw egypt move on it own too and it wa our leader obvious in that period in the 1967 period and achiev a peac treati with israel and a situat of peac with israel we have done our best to move the palestinian dimens forward and suddenli we saw our palestinian brethren move and thei ar the peopl most immedi concern and our concern and achiev progress there in thi situat we feel that nobodi ha the right to ask us what to do and we have a respons toward ourselv toward our countri toward our land toward our right to do whatev we can to move and safeguard our interest and that is what we ar do precis so i hope that we will see progress on everi other track and we will see eventu the come togeth of the comprehens peac in the region but we ar awar of our respons toward our peopl and we ar carri them out correspond your majesti can i ask you to step back from the daili new event to look at the broader issu of democraci in the middl east your kingdom ha taken stride but in most of the arab world there is littl or no movement and in other place where it ha been tri there ar breakdown in yemen and algeria could you reflect for us for a minut on the prospect for democraci in the arab world and the challeng that lie ahead husayn as far as i am concern and mani mai or mai not agre with me democraci plural respect for human right is the onli wai is the best wai i hope that we have demonstr that in jordan that we will continu to do so in the time ahead and there is noth more import than for peopl to feel that thei ar someth that thei mean someth that thei have right to share in shape their futur and i hope that jordan will be a good exampl to other in that regard and in that respect i believ when institut ar establish thei ar also a guarante for continu for stabil in the entir region so we cannot claim to have the right to speak for other or advis other what to do but as far as we ar concern democraci plural respect for human right is a part of our veri exist and will continu to be alwai correspond word indistinct experi in algeria and yemen have been so unsuccess so far veri discourag to peopl who would like to support democraci in the arab world husayn well regard yemen unfortun again i didn t cover the answer in ani great detail but when on see thi ongo struggl on is realli puzzl becaus the uniti wa not creat by forc the uniti came as a result of the peopl of yemen elect to have that uniti come to be there wa a plebiscit there wa a format of uniti within the countri there wa an elect for a parliament there wa an elect of a presid there wa creation of someth new and suddenli we see it fall apart obvious what is in my heart is a wish that if there is ani mean to all these terribl loss that have occur that at least that is preserv somehow and that dialogu will result in a solut to these problem we have been involv in the problem to the best of our abil we have tri to creat bridg and a solid foundat for progress but that in term of the realiti of the matter requir a polit will at the veri highest level that mayb wa not alwai there and therefor it ha fail and i hope that somehow the yemeni can pull it togeth so that it is not a question of north and south but union for those who ar oppos to it and those who ar oppos to it i hope will be a minor but who can tell i realli can t tell what will happen correspond concern the confront your excel the confront countri which ar suppos to be meet befor ani resumpt of talk ha thi formula end now forev that jordan syria plo and lebanon meet with each other ha it end husayn it hasn t necessarili end but here again let me remind you that we were the peopl who ar push for that more than ani and for coordin more than ani but the realiti of the matter ar that mayb we haven t all risen to the level that is need to creat the kind of coordin that could have been nonetheless we ar in touch and we hope that the result of our continu effort all of us will enabl us to achiev greater harmoni and help each other in the time ahead correspond your majesti could you clarifi on thing i am still a littl confus about you said at on point that a meet with the isra leadership and presum prime minist rabin would be the natur outgrowth of negoti with israel that ar about to resum in a week that the negoti

recent year after 1967 we fought the battl along with our brother led by egypt as a reaffirm of our arab commit to the collect defens pact and our belong to the arab leagu at a later stage our brother in egypt chose to walk the path of peac thei were the leader in 1967 after that the palestinian brother who ar primarili concern with thi affair decid to step forward and assum their respons in look for thi right on their nation soil it wa unreason for jordan to lag behind or to wait for everybodi els to address their own issu jordan regrett ha no support except from god almighti in the region jordan ha no support or back from ani superpow not even ani countri in the region for the sake of palestin the caus and the peopl on the palestinian nation soil and for the sake of the arab nation and

syrian reaction i have not heard anyth from hi excel brother hafiz al asad on the person level we have been in continu contact until the latest stage i paid a visit to damascu we met and we discuss

we us thi term and did our utmost to achiev it i am not here deal with thi issu in light of the recent syrian stand but in light of it basi name the jordanian palestinian situat our issu and interest ar interlink so we should be togeth in confront the danger face us coordin in the full sens of the word ha not been achiev yet on ani level everi now and then we ask the brother how far thei have gone in their talk or we tell them where we ar if thei ask our brother in syria have their own definit and known problem concern the occupi syrian territori we have our own problem coordin ha not reach the level of minor detail thei in syria can afford to wait in light of their circumst situat and potenti howev our issu and it interlinkag with the palestinian issu made us discuss thi issu jordan syria the palestinian brother and lebanon start from the same point in madrid we ar seek a comprehens peac thi howev doe not mean we relinquish our right to address our issu we also do not assum that syria will relinquish it right to address it issu neither do we assum that syria should relinquish it right to deal with it problem we coordin if that is the word concern issu that we must coordin about that is issu that we and thei agre to coordin on howev practic coordin in the sens i meant talk about or search for wa realli talk devoid of substanc save our endeavor to reach a comprehens and just peac accept to futur gener milhim is the absenc of arab coordin caus by the requir of sovereignti or is it caus by polit differ apprehens or basic lack of trust between certain parti concern coordin is like a group danc and it seem that some particip ar accus other of not move to the agre tune husayn let me be frank on thi point we cannot sai to the arab peopl that there is coordin when there is no such thing and then surpris them with what is happen the jordanian syrian coordin which wa plan to be a syrian jordanian meet on the level of the head of the govern is on anoth dimens it is connect with effort to realiz some integr deal with the syrian jordanian famili relat if we can us thi term it wa hope that issu would develop concern lebanon such a meet wa held with egypt so that we could gather togeth and begin to proce toward the condit which we wish thi wa postpon at the wish of our syrian brother and we hope the postpon will not be for long milhim doe thi mean that the jordanian syrian relat have enter a period of cool do you intend to contain the situat husayn word indistinct problem concern us and i do not believ that there is a problem with the syrian brother we have remain in contact and togeth we suffer much throughout a veri long journei brother presid al asad know me veri well and i know him and our relationship is built on sincer and truth milhim recent you also lament lack of coordin with the plo how do you describ the relationship between you and the plo now husayn a good relationship we support the plo from the begin and we address the palestinian peopl as a whole and call on them to be cohes and crystal their idea and ambit through their cohes becaus the most danger thing is to break up in thi critic phase we also discuss the econom dimens there is a jordanian palestinian agreement follow by a palestinian isra agreement now we need a jordanian palestinian isra meet to review all that happen and see where we might reach had there been coordin and a joint palestinian jordanian stand from the begin we would have taken a short cut and perhap realiz more than what we have realiz so far therefor our posit in the futur will be to respond to ani palestinian appeal to us and help them in ani wai on problem at a time becaus in the absenc of real coordin there could be integr in stand thi is the onli choic milhim your majesti can we imagin the jordanian isra negoti in the come month take an advanc phase lead to sign a peac agreement even if no progress is realiz on other track thi is what we understand from your statement husayn it is veri difficult to sai how issu will develop but there is no reason why we should not have progress on all track so that all of us will reach the cherish goal and realiz a just and comprehens peac milhim five year ago you began the process of democrat and the expans of the polit base which led to the format of parti and hold elect and other step in thi regard look back how would you evalu the past phase what were the most signific develop and what ar the disappoint do you think that there should be a critic evalu of what took place in the outgo phase husayn critic revis is necessari all the time in the life of ani peopl i believ that thi appli to us in jordan but the democrat choic and the particip of the jordanian regardless of their origin in make their presenc and futur is an indispens basi in addit to the polit plural and respect for human right arab peopl need to feel and i hope that the jordanian now feel thi that thei ar not frustrat that thei ar not shun that their right and digniti ar preserv and that thei practic and dynam contribut to make their present and futur i believ that through thi march which could not resum except after the disengag of administr and legal connect with the west bank which wa follow by the plo accept of resolut 242 until we reach the present condit i sai that through thi march which proceed in veri difficult circumst and in the face of most danger challeng in the region we have found ourselv stronger than we have ever been despit the continu pressur and the difficulti which we ar suffer milhim your majesti prior to the outbreak of war in yemen jordan contribut to the attempt to arriv at a polit settlement howev the explos took place how do you assess the situat in yemen and the futur of yemen what do the event in yemen mean with respect to the absenc of an arab author or arab mechan to prevent similar explos in arab state husayn i believ that thi situat or ani similar tragic situat in the arab homeland should be tackl within an arab context therefor we had respond to the brother appeal and tri the imposs for month to arriv at the accord that wa sign in amman repres of the entir yemeni peopl and all forc in yemen without except attend the sign ceremoni and sign the accord we had high hope that that event would be a turn point howev we were soon surpris by the consecut explos at the begin we tri through a jordanian team and a fratern omani team both work as on team to stop the deterior we were success to a great extent later the pictur becam broader in term of particip by other brother and variou side in fact we discov that we could not continu our mission with respect to the militari aspect of the yemeni agreement thi is becaus unless there is polit will it would be difficult to continu the process of unifi the armi and the arm forc thi wa suppos to take place at the begin of the uniti howev our brother effort were neg affect for a while after the gulf crisi besid we were all too preoccupi to perform our duti toward them in term of provid advic to help them at that time therefor we withdrew the militari team and so did oman afterward matter proceed toward an explos we have a jordanian medic team there do it best on the humanitarian level we still hope that those yemeni figur who met in amman as repres of entir yemen and it area polit movement and peopl will have the abil just as thei had the abil to meet in amman to maintain yemeni uniti and to creat the logic and abil to accept even a small portion of the human and materi loss on the yemeni area so that partit could be avoid for god forbid yemen could be partit even into more than south and north we have alwai been support of a unifi modern democrat and strong yemen to take it place in the arab world i do not know what the motiv and reason ar but regrett it seem that mani element in the arab world seek a futur fragment thu lead to potenti danger and disast throughout the entir arab world we will not hesit

readi to join the war between the plo and jordan over the represent of the jerusalem problem but the smell of gunpowd is alreadi in the air not between israel and the arab but precis between the plo

there will inevit be great hope to end thi tragedi in a wai to give all concern parti particularli the palestinian side their right on their nation soil and consequ to give all side the chanc for a

to the come gener so thei can live under it canopi and build on it regard the fear thei ar real on and ar repres by the lack of coordin regardless of sign of coordin from time to time on the arab

without tackl the religi mandat which safeguard the right of the follow of the three divin religion sovereignti over the holi place should onli be to god as a result of the lack of coordin dure the 24

surpris that the resolut wa issu the wai it wa i tri to do the imposs in the last moment i tri to hold contact to achiev someth and to focu on the request not to veto the resolut or to abstain particularli by the unit state if thi ha to happen and it ha actual happen then there must be a wai by which we obtain an assur that the unit state polici on jerusalem will not chang as it chang in

incid were dealt with includ some mistak in other word had we been abl to avoid mention jerusalem and instead refer to the geneva convent on the protect of citizen under occup in order to protect the palestinian in all the territori which were occupi in 1967 we would have found ourselv in a better situat than the on we experienc as a result of the resolut and the us abstent someth which could be interpret as a chang in the us posit on arab demand in jerusalem the onli explan for all thi is that it is a result of the lack of coordin at critic sensit point and under difficult circumst call for coordin is appar meant to provid a kind of cover for progress by thi or that arab side whenev thei feel like it howev the chief demand for all of us is to have full coordin so far we have not been abl to achiev thi natur thi is not encourag becaus israel is on side while we ar sever we have not been abl to crystal a posit which reflect the arab posit and it serious about reach a just last and comprehens peac accept to futur gener on the other hand there ar great hope that the world will pai more attent to the need to act regard the issu we face in order to come up with accept solut that ar convinc to the peopl in thi region to enabl them to obtain what is their right we hope that the perform will improv in the futur to enhanc the chanc to reach the aspir solut al siyasah al duwaliyah what ar the prospect for the establish of a palestinian state how do you view thi state how do you evalu the posit of the palestinian insid and outsid the occupi territori on the futur of the region husayn i am alwai hesit to speak frankli about these issu fear what i sai might be misconstru howev i believ the palestinian brother have a chanc which thei should not miss regardless of what thei ar go to achiev we hope that the first step regard the oslo accord will constitut the begin and that effort will continu to implement secur council resolut 242 and achiev palestinian demand on palestinian nation soil i feel that what the brother have experienc over the past 26 year and their continu suffer make it imposs to imagin that a palestinian entiti would be establish unless it is base on democraci and respect for human right and unless the palestinian peopl exercis their right to take part in shape their futur awai from ani method the arab have got us to in thi part of the world and at thi time in the greater homeland thi is the onli road that can yield good result for the palestinian consequ thei should contribut to promot a new pattern which we here in jordan insist on propos to the arab brother in our greater homeland through the exercis of democraci and respect the human right and worth of the arab individu provid thi individu contribut posit to the shape of hi own futur al siyasah al duwaliyah doe the peac process endang jordan particularli if autonomi lead to a state of instabl in the occupi territori which ar at the door of the kingdom husayn i hope no such thing will take place we hope that the situat in the occupi territori will stabil when these territori ar liber and that the march will proce to liber thi land and grant the palestinian their right on it as for us here in jordan our cours is to safeguard the uniti of the on big famili to which we belong from all origin and to have our march proce on the basi of the nation charter the constitut democraci shura and the respect for human right until the circumst of ani member of thi famili enabl him to opt for anoth cours if he find the road open to him to exercis thi right until that time we will remain more than ever cohes in the face of all eventu it is no secret that we ar constantli subject to moment pressur becaus we believ in democraci in shura and in man and hi right to particip in map out hi futur some mai view thi as a threat to them while we view it as the onli cours to achiev stabil and build the arab forc on the pan arab level on the other hand threat ar be made against thi countri to subdu it howev with god s help thi countri and it son will not be subdu and will onli bow their head to god in my opinion we ar to prepar ourselv for more pressur we must endur these pressur becaus what is in the balanc is more import than everyth els more import than us and more import than thi stage through which we pass thi is becaus our respons is toward the futur honor the caus and toward justic no parti ha succeed in impos on us someth in which we do not believ we ar commit to the peac process and we want peac but a peac that can last and under whose canopi all will enjoi a new state of affair that will be differ from what we have experienc over the protract past al siyasah al duwaliyah jordanian public opinion ha not been suffici taken into consider as you repeatedli state in your opinion how will the jordanian approach peac husayn we have a public opinion and it should be consult and taken into consider howev frankli speak i believ that we should work more to inform the peopl about all the fact so that thei can form an opinion we should stop tackl our caus in a pessimist manner or with the mental of the fifti we should be realist and respons and at the same time act through the confid we all have in the sound of our march and the knowledg we ar proceed in the right direct take into account all the realiti we and thi region ar experienc al siyasah al duwaliyah how do you view the impact of peac on region economi particularli the jordanian economi follow the sign of an econom agreement between the plo and jordan and the sign of other agreement by the plo israel and egypt husayn as for the econom dimens there is much talk on the issu of arab boycott of israel for exampl we howev ar try to explain the issu to the world and we also demand that there be a balanc in deal with that dimens the question is not on of an arab boycott of israel i believ that the current situat of foreign compani and industri with interest in the region is now differ from the previou on israel is actual exercis a boycott israel is a state that protect it product and exercis a boycott against the palestinian the arab and jordan in particular all these issu should be treat in an appropri manner to clear the wai for futur deal on the other hand if peac is achiev it will give the world and us in particular everi chanc to deal with mani persist issu and will improv the qualiti of life there ar other persist issu foremost of which is water for exampl we want to know what our share of water is all resourc mai not be suffici for all the parti involv name palestin jordan and israel thi issu should be dealt with quickli expect ar that water resourc avail to us in jordan will not be suffici in the futur even for household us within the next few year so altern resourc should be sought we have to move toward peac in light of the content of the agenda of bilater negoti with israel an agenda which wa sign by us and the other side and which includ the issu of the occupi jordanian territori and without encroach on the palestinian right pertain to what us to be our respons until the palestinian side assum it respons when these territori return to jordan s sovereignti we can discuss what can be done regard the jordan vallei begin from the north as well as the water issu in order to find answer to the question on our right the other arab side right and the isra dimens in thi issu al siyasah al duwaliyah would you pleas brief us on jordan s principl posit on peac in light of amman s refus to sign a peac agreement with israel befor all the outstand issu ar solv doe jordan mean bilater issu alon or all the arab issu husayn all these matter should be dealt with we have been face an arab posit in other word jordan wa ask to sign a peac treati and then discuss all these detail thi is strang talk thi propos method appli onli to the state of surrend not to the state of make a last peac therefor we insist on deal with all these differ issu on the differ side so that peac can crown satisfactori solut to all these issu peac cannot be achiev unless we deal with all issu i believ that progress is be made on the other track in the final analysi the goal is a comprehens solut which is requir to chang the imag into the new situat that is peac in the region al siyasah al duwaliyah how do you view progress on the syrian and lebanes track especi after the al asad clinton meet and syria s accept in principl of sign a peac treati with israel husayn we ar now focus on bilater issu howev we ar well awar that the same method of oper is be us on the other track there ar issu that affect all of us such as the question of water there is also an import dimens of peac that must entail a chang in the pattern of peopl s behavior and the opportun avail to them thi chang should mean a new begin in contrast with what the case ha been so far all of thi requir discuss and studi we cannot tell the world go ahead and chang the situat of man in thi part of the world befor we address all these issu onc we do that we can ask the world to step in and contribut to shape the futur in light of the desir peac i believ that the al asad clinton meet wa us and veri import there is mutual confid thi is what i have sens from presid clinton when i met him and also from the syrian presid as a result of the frank discuss the two presid had at that meet the dialogu is continu and thi is undoubtedli encourag and give us hope that thing will proce in the right direct the us presid and hi administr ar come under pressur there is also an ongo battl in the us arena by certain parti which ar try to bring about posit in favor of israel at thi critic stage when we ar wit seriou attempt to achiev a just and last peac in thi region what is upset about all of thi is that the arab posit is fragment unpleas and unsatisfactori we ask a question at the outset wa it necessari to involv the question of jerusalem in resolut 904 on the hebron massacr sinc it wa possibl to see a us veto or abstent doe thi signal a chang in the us posit in our contact we have ask the unit state to tell us that it posit doe not signal a chang howev time will tell whether or not thi is the case if thi is the case then mai be there is a flaw in the wai we have been collect address the question on the arab level so far thi portend loss at present and neg effect on arab interest in gener in the futur al siyasah al duwaliyah the yemeni accord document which wa sign in jordan prove that inter arab problem can be solv by the arab themselv which is contrari to the situat dure the gulf crisi doe thi attempt contain hope toward improv inter arab relat in a more comprehens wai husayn it seem that we were blame when we said we hope that thi would be the begin of solv inter arab problem on the intern arab level and within the on famili we mai not have reach the desir solut yet howev i feel that what ha been achiev is a great accomplish becaus all repres of the yemeni peopl were in amman when the document wa sign therefor we hope that the arab public will plai it role in maintain the accord and achiev it object unfortun we found that directli after the sign of the document the situat in yemen wa on the verg of a big explos we along with our brother in the sultan of oman made a move i believ that the effort by the joint militari team result in remov the specter of bloodi clash all the evid show that these clash could have taken a tragic form now what is requir of our brother in yemen is to prevent the reccur of such a critic situat on on hand and to

the palestinian issu for their own purpos of confront the second is the return of egypt to arab uniti allow cairo to rejoin the arab summit group and the arab leagu after 10 year of absenc egypt wa expel for sign the camp david accord with israel act in concert for the first time the arab mai be a signific element in peac diplomaci although king hussein of jordan announc last juli that the west bank problem would no longer be a jordanian respons arafat said the plo wa readi to establish a confeder between a new palestinian state and jordan if the monarch wa will the third is the palestinian level the intifada arafat said the upris began take shape as earli as 1986 although it did not fulli emerg until decemb 1987 it becam possibl he went on when the barrier of fear wa broken among our peopl now the intifada is similar to what the indian had done in face the british occup he said 100 of the 1 7 million palestinian in the occupi territori support the intifada the crucial thing now he

LA041389-0010: israel and plo ar alreadi talk despit the link of us mediat pace will remain slow the main conclus emerg from prime minist yitzhak shamir s visit to washington is that indirect negoti have in effect been initi between the palestin liber organ and israel with the mediat of the unit state on ha to be total blind not to recogn thi fact the propos the unit state ha receiv from israel will now be transmit to the plo in tunisia the american repres will try to sell the idea of the isra prime minist to the plo leadership thei will then come back from tunisia with counterpropos on how to start the first stage of the peac process and so on back and forth shamir mai insist that israel will never negoti with the plo under ani circumst but both he and the rest of the isra cabinet understand that from now on the american will shuttl between them and the plo with propos and counterpropos elect in the occupi territori will onli strengthen thi trend if shamir s propos is accept there can onli be on outcom the plo repres will win thi alreadi happen in the 1976 municip elect in the west bank plo repres were elect then if elect ar held in the territori shamir will have no choic but to accept those elect after he himself ha propos to start the process shamir will call them repres of the palestinian popul but in realiti thei will be plo repres more authent perhap than the plo leadership outsid the territori but nonetheless take their direct from plo headquart in tunisia there ar conflict of interest between the palestinian resid of the territori and the plo repres abroad which mai deepen in the futur but it is a mistak to think that on can drive a wedg between the two group both have the same object get rid of the isra occup and gain independ neither group want to be weaken by be separ from the other in other word the isra leadership is outwardli cling to a fiction maintain that the plo doe not exist and that the palestinian resid of the territori do not want to be repres by it for the moment the bush administr is will to let the isra govern live with thi fiction provid the process is initi likud whose repres ar now conduct israel s foreign polici will find that just as in the case of the jordanian option anyon who wish to end the palestinian isra conflict will not be abl to do so without the plo henc rather than look for substitut effort should be made to chang the plo see to it that the moder in it rank in the territori and tuni control the organ and accept israel s minim militari condit is shamir prepar to cooper in thi process hi talk in washington indic that at least in the initi stage he is will to coordin the first move with the unit state the fact that the unit state is engag in a dialogu with the plo ha not deter him he ha not brought along a plan but rather a few idea the central on be the hold of democrat elect in the territori in the past includ in the camp david accord it wa agre that such elect would onli take place after the transit period at thi point shamir is prepar to hold elect beforehand at an earlier stage provid violenc in the territori is stop he is even will to find a wai that will enabl the palestinian resid of isra annex east jerusalem to take part shamir accept the idea embodi in the camp david accord that the process will not stop at the interim stage and that negoti on the final statu of the territori ar to be expect he would not howev go beyond that line hi talk in washington show onc again that when it come to the west bank he is not will to adopt the formula of territori for peac shamir s interpret of un secur council resolut 242 is altogeth differ from the interpret of the framer of the resolut who at the time consult israel s repres as well and of cours from the interpret of washington thi in effect elimin ani possibl of negoti between israel and jordan even if king hussein were will to repres the palestinian in negoti with israel and the palestinian themselv agre to it there would be no basi for initi negoti under such condit ar the idea that shamir brought to washington suffici to move along the peac process thei ar suffici to start the process and get over the first hurdl thi is why washington could not reject shamir s idea outright and stop the process befor it even began shamir s propos will have no mean or valu if in the meantim the govern of israel keep it promis and establish new settlement in the territori in order for the wagon to start roll the american diplomat will have to wrap the propos in the proper packag and persuad the plo to allow the palestinian in the territori to go to the poll it is clear that the plo will not accept the propos befor it know what it place in these elect will be anyon who expect to see a quick resolut of the blood drench conflict is bound to be disappoint with the result of the washington visit of shamir and egyptian presid hosni mubarak and the expect visit of king hussein washington itself is plan it move by take tini step across the entir front rather than look for spectacular breakthrough for the moment the palestinian will have to make do with thi slow pace as for shamir and the viewpoint he repres thi mean gain time but israel is left with the difficult dilemma of a person who hold a glow coal in hi hand and cannot throw it awai
