thei aren t grai from a distanc said larri fukuhara program director at the cabrillo marin museum in san pedro the babi ar grai but the adult pick up barnacl and scar over the year and when the barnacl fall off thei turn the whale s skin white if you see them through the water though thei have a bluish color the first time you re like to spot a whale fukuhara said is when it breath roll it back abov the surfac the whale expel water through it blowhol shoot the water up to 10 feet in the air with a whuf sound it look like smoke fukuhara said and thei do it almost everi time thei surfac there is no rule of behavior govern breath but there is sort of a pattern fukuhara said gener a grai whale will breath and disappear below the surfac for about a minut then repeat the process after the third appear the whale will make a deep dive that last for two to eight minut as thi dive begin the whale will typic flip it tail it fluke into the air a maneuv eagerli await by watcher with
