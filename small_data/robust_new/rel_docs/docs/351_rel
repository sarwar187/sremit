and guido di tella s foreign polici what ha chang is our concern over the island interest in the past thi aspect wa not taken into account as much as it is now carvallo in what sens petrella democrat argentina realiz that the island have their own ident that the island societi is no longer the pastor nor isol societi it wa befor 1982 to a certain degre the war with all it terribl aspect brought an econom well be the island did not enjoi befor these fact must be taken into account in a negoti in fact dure all our meet with the british and the island we have fulli respect their interest we believ the island will gradual grow closer to us through dialogu and the fact that argentina continu to grow and is predict from the polit viewpoint in addit the southern cone offer a climat of harmoni cooper friendship and firm regard our claim carvallo but ar the island awar of that petrella there ar concret sign that lead us to believ that our polici ha prompt a debat on the island if you read the penguin new local daili as carefulli as we do you will notic that the island discuss a relationship with argentina natur it is not alwai fulli posit thei argu and sai rude thing about us but at

ha still not been solv with great britain who still refus to sell us spare part and militari equip thi is veri complic becaus most of argentina s militari equip tradition wa british passag omit carvallo it ha been said that the island have about 50 percent more oil than what great britain can extract from the north sea petrella the two compani that have prospect for oil with the purpos of find someon interest in bui their studi might sai that no on ha bought that studi although the british sai a phantom argentin enterpris did but i do not know for sure argentina doe not want to hasten a debat that not onli ha an ecolog aspect but also a veri import person aspect everyon know that it take a lot of peopl to exploit a singl oil well and thi will definit chang the island wai of life which we consid sacr and someth that must be preserv passag omit carvallo it is quit surpris that argentina through you should sai that it is not particularli interest in ani oil there might be on the island petrella i am not make an offici statement it is a comment to a journalist who work for el mercurio from chile a friendli countri i am tell a friend that argentina could not care less about the oil on the malvina becaus it ha plenti of it own and becaus the oil price is not go to increas when russia flood the world with it oil a veri strict cartel will have to be creat to prevent price from drop carvallo some believ oil could caus new tension in the south atlant petrella between 1971 and 1982 we gave oil to the island therefor oil is not the problem the problem ha to do with the jurisdict and legal aspect of the uk unilater explor and exploit in the malvina thi territori is in disput and we cannot remain indiffer to unilater action thi is why we ar seek cooper carvallo to defin sovereignti petrella that is the question we must gener a common space we have alreadi made a clear propos regard the oil to a high rank offici we propos creat a joint author to assign exploit area accord to a practic criteria all thi must be done under the sovereignti umbrella that wa creat to enabl these move without either of the two parti acquir better accumul right carvallo in the meantim argentina is tell oil compani that it will oppos oil exploit without it approv petrella of cours we have told them that ani invest will encount legal problem but i cannot sai what we ar go to do we ar warn the compani that thi territori is in disput when there ar so mani other place in the world we cannot or should not approv the explor and exploit of resourc in these area until that disput ha been settl or until the involv parti have agre to toler each other passag omit carvallo island governor david tatham said to me why so much interest in a joint oil exploit with argentina

have recogn our right the uk could obvious contact whichev countri it wish if a disput recogn by the unit nation did not exist carvallo what do you expect from chile then petrella solidar that contact with the island be made consid argentin interest in ani negoti that chile maintain the magnific commit undertaken by presid patricio aylwin to back our right we regard thi as on of chile s greatest act of friendship throughout our common histori on of the main object of presid menem s foreign polici implement by foreign minist di tella ha been to maintain the best and most cordial relationship with chile and thi not onli becaus of cultur reason but for econom and strateg reason carvallo chile howev is in the uncomfort posit that whatev it doe mai affect it optimum relationship with the two countri in disput petrella argentina s stanc on the uk ha been to sai that it must plai a construct role in the southern cone in other word it can no longer specul on differ between argentina and chile as in the past when some were more obviou than other becaus there wa usual mutual distrust thi must no longer exist argentin chilean integr must progress thi is why ani british govern gestur that mai affect the argentin chilean relationship is consid discourag in argentina we have told the british thi mani time and we ar certain we have the support of the chilean govern carvallo what ha great britain done late regard chile that mai discourag argentina petrella there were three episod on wa the british govern invit to chilean legisl to visit the malvina thi in itself is not especi
