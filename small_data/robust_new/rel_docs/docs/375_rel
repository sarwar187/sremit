FBIS3-42854: languag estonian articl type cso articl by aap t anav niitenberg not afraid of nuclear plant the daughter of estonia s energi minist arvo niitenberg is involv in liquid accid at nuclear plant text i have been tell my western colleagu that had thei had a steep price hike like we had in estonia thei would have had riot in the street sai energi minist arvo niitenberg smugli as he recal the econom crisi of the 70 s in the unit state at that time american rais the price of a liter of gasolin by 10 cent and there were incid of shoot at ga station estonia s energet ha surviv a major price shock over the past two year coal heat oil natur ga diesel fuel and gasolin have been brought to world market price oil shale and electr ar not at world market price sai niitenberg satisfi that estonia ha move into world economi the price of gasolin in estonia and the world price of unprocess crude ar now link on dramat exampl of relentlessli rise price is the 754 time jump in the price of natur ga as compar to the soviet era the minist believ that our energi polici which in it form stage drew prais from it teacher like the world bank the european bank of develop and reconstruct and other organ will make estonia stronger in the futur the dai of wast cheap energi ar over no more sudden price hike as is happen elsewher the price of energi in estonia will still be go up but i don t forese ani sudden jump sai niitenberg and find that the price of electr for exampl is favor low compar to some of our neighbor he doe not believ that the price of electr will ever go up to finland s level 5 time higher than our and that estonia will alwai have an advantag electr is unnatur cheap in russia but compar to other neighbor state estonian produc enjoi a certain advantag while the consumpt of electr ha been go up late the demand for liquid fuel ha been drop dure 1993 onli 600 000 tonn of heat oil were consum compar to it previou consumpt level of up to 1 600 000 tonn a year part of that differ is attribut to user economi the rest to a gener econom declin i believ we can increas product without drastic increas the demand for energi we have to reduc the energi loss that current amount to roughli on third of the total if that part of the energi could be us to develop the economi energi expenditur would not have to go up for the time be niitenberg sai as an exampl he cite denmark where energi consumpt goe up by less than 1 percent yet the economi is develop at a much faster rate thi is the result of energi conserv program the dane have made a transit to more modern heat system thei have financ estonia by contrast is plagu by lack of capit the proport of domest fuel is small for the develop of energet we have receiv loan from the european commun total 76 7 million estonian kroon with that monei more than 140 energi relat project have been carri out in differ part of estonia these have been mostli small plant for local parish us instal to make a transit to domest fuel and to reduc energi loss niitenberg sai the proport of domest fuel sourc is current not as great in estonia as it is in our neighbor countri timber and peat provid 3 5 percent of the necessari energi in the nordic countri thi share is roughli 7 percent in finland between 12 and 13 percent it would be possibl to increas the share of timber and peat to 10 percent it is interest to note that even though estonia import much of it fuel close to 70 percent of the energi is obtain local in thi respect we ar much better off than latvia or lithuania we have oil shale electr timber and peat onli liquid fuel and natur ga ar brought in niitenberg sai estonia need an explos plant out of the product cost for oil shale on third goe for explos which for the time be ar still come from our eastern neighbor price of explos and fuse have gone up and that in turn ha jack up the price of oil shale eesti p olevkivi estonian oil shale is in the process of negoti with a swedish and a german firm for put up an explos plant in estonia specif for mine depend on technolog thi will requir an invest of roughli 5 to 10 million a studi is be conduct to show how fast the plant can pai for itself last year 13 5 million tonn of oil shale were produc in estonia and i cannot see that volum go down in the near futur we can tell potenti foreign buyer that the market is stabl and give them certain guarante niitenberg think send us pressur pipe not expert both firm ar interest but ar still busi look for market possibl in other nearbi region niitenberg think there ar certain advantag to invest in estonia it is not like deal with the third world countri who cannot manag on their own we have technic know how and an industri infra structur all we need is modern technolog in my deal with foreign i have had to repeat time and again pleas believ me we also have expert we would rather have 300 meter of pressur pipe than seven expert sai niitenberg convinc that estonia can offer some excel specialist in the area of energet in addit to capit we also lack the skill of organ the work a strateg reserv would be necessari lack of capit also stand in the wai of creat a strateg reserv of fuel niitenberg is a believ in have strateg reserv the onli question be what is the most effect wai of us the financi resourc avail for estonia to to maintain a three month reserv of liquid fuel would tie up 300 to 400 million estonia is not rich enough to let such amount sit idl first a decis need to be made how much of a reserv should be maintain thi presum that we know what we want to be insur against we have the facil for store liquid fuel but not for natur ga 100 percent of which come in from russia put those up would take an extrem larg invest the closest usabl storag facil ar locat in latvia niitenberg sai ad that the question of strateg reserv ha been discuss in govern and ha been assign to the work group of the econom ministri the problem is wider in scope and includ the area of medicin food and other such refin plant to cost 1 billion canada where niitenberg work for mani year in lead posit within the energi system had a rel low level of reserv emphasi wa place on infra structur make sure that fuel could be move immedi whenev need the reserv of liquid fuel were distribut between big oil compani with the state keep track of how fast some compani or other could obtain a certain quantiti of fuel most of the respons wa born by petro canada a compani similar to our eesti k utu estonian fuel there is alwai the question can the state place an oblig on a privat compani in case of a possibl crisi we have two choic either we have barrel store somewher or we have a firm plan for how to transport the necessari amount of fuel from some refin plant in denmark or poland to estonia within three dai put up our own plant would requir a capit outlai of 800 to 900 million wherea transport storag and other support servic for import have improv significantli as of late in canada i dealt with electr that could not be kept in reserv for unexpect situat altern had to be found niitenberg sai a nuclear plant doe not have to be hazard among specialist there ha also been talk about put up a nuclear power plant in estonia speak of monei niitenberg volunt the cost of the darlington nuclear power plant as an exampl ontario hydro the canadian compani where niitenberg work befor come to estonia and where he still ha a posit wait for him invest 14 billion canadian dollar in build thi 3 600 mw capac power plant thi project design for an oper life of 30 to 40 year is not expect to turn a profit for the first 10 year the possibl of put up a nuclear power plant should be analyz abov all from an econom point of view if the potenti profit is a mere two cent per kilowatt it will obvious not be worth the risk it would be a complet differ situat howev if the nuclear plant would enabl us to produc electr at half the previou cost on of the biggest burden imagin is a nuclear plant that doe not work effici or doe not have a suffici load howev atom power plant can turn out to be extrem profit we should not dismiss ani of the altern on simpli emot ground even though we know what happen at chernobyl and what is go on in paldiski where the biggest danger is over by now sai niitenberg who wa in charg of 20 nuclear power plant in canada and who ha a daughter involv in liquid nuclear power plant accid as long as everyth is well organ thi field is not as danger as it is thought to be if that were not so i would not have allow my daughter to work in thi field it is signific that in accord with intern agreement inform should be disclos on ani accid so that appropri conclus could be drawn by nuclear energi specialist in neighbor countri and throughout the world at chernobyl thi agreement wa violat niitenberg explain futur will bring new solut niitenberg think that thi issu will not come up on estonia s agenda befor the year 2000 for sure and that it will take a polit decis in principl either by politician or by a referendum as far as the futur of energet for the whole world goe niitenberg doe not deign offer anyth specif if i knew the solut i would becom a veri rich man he laugh and think that bio energet will develop for sure also feasibl is the so call fusion method which is the next step in har nuclear energi base on the abil of heavi hydrogen isotop to combin into helium at extrem high temperatur yield energi from the neutron thu releas to the question about current fuel reserv and how long thei will last niitenberg repli with anoth question for what kind of monei canada ha supposedli more crude oil than all arab countri combin but due to natur condit pump it out would cost 30 time more than the current norm

engin us for comparison in hydrogen ce we evalu the caus thereof were shown to be restrict to a lean region with an excess air ratio of 1 8 or more in order to prevent abnorm combust and a reduct of intak air due to the larg volum occupi by the hydrogen ga fuel both of which result in a reduct of heat suppli to 54 that of a gasolin engin consequ we consid these 2 factor the main caus of the low hydrogen ce output in contrast the work chamber in an re revolv as shown in figur 6 and the locat where intak compress expans and exhaust stroke occur differ we believ that the rel low temperatur of

in figur 10 the excess air ratio at which prematur ignit began declin after an increas in spark plug heat valu from the gasolin specif heat valu of 5 as a result we learn that normal oper is possibl even at 1 when heat valu ar rais to 13 consequ it becam clear that spark plug were the ignit sourc for the prematur ignit in figur 9 and that abnorm combust can be avoid even at 1 through the us of

under partial load if oper is pursu at 2 3 from the abov result we found that hydrogen re requir no structur chang or attach of special devic to prevent abnorm combust near the theoret air fuel ratio capabl of draw maximum output mere switch to spark plug with a heat valu suit to engin requir is suffici it is thu demonstr that re possess a structur which is fundament easili adapt to hydrogen engin for which prevent abnorm combust is the most import concern nonetheless the 75 of gasolin specif output obtain even through oper at the theoret air fuel ratio is low likewis sinc air and hydrogen ar

reason is that the direct inject system with it high volumetr effici for air oper leaner than the premix system under an ident load we therefor feel that the declin in heat effici due to rich becom a

thought to result from a reduct in the volumetr effici of air sinc there is no declin in the volumetr effici of air at 1 in a direct inject system we felt that a rich mixtur benefit thermal dissoci and air util would obtain peak valu in result we obtain a 28 higher output with the direct inject system than the premix system at 1 and 35 higher at 0 8 in convers to direct inject under these condit

akin to hydrogen convers to direct fuel inject ha an output improv effect akin to that of supercharg system us turbocharg etc that supercharg statu is not achiev at 1 000 rpm is laid princip to the fact that air port time in thi engin is design for high revolut and not enough air is taken in at low revolut rang to achiev supercharg thu supercharg mai be made possibl at all revolut rang if a

develop of fesi inf 2 inf thermoelectr power gener us sunlight as heat sourc as describ in the previou section it ha becom possibl to obtain high heat of 800 c stabil at the latter stage of electrolyt cell unit oper with the us of the prototyp solar receiv we have therefor conduct r d of a system design to gener power us in electrolysi through the direct convers of heat into electr util thermoelectr element which util the high temperatur of 800 c the perform of thermoelectr materi is evalu by the perform index given by graphic and repres thermoelectr power thermal conduct and electr resist sige and fesi inf 2 inf ar known as high temperatur type power gener element although the perform index of the fesi inf 2 inf thermal power gener element is consid low matsubara and hi team at yamaguchi univers report recent that by treat the fesi inf 2 inf element in the oxygen plasma thei were abl to produc a high perform index inf 2 inf fesi inf 2 inf thermoelectr power gener element as a result thi element is now attract attent as a promis high temperatur power gener element materi moreov sinc a larg number of power gener element ar requir in heat electr direct convers element materi cost must be low from the standpoint of materi cost also the us of the fesi inf 2 inf thermoelectr power gener element will be welcom for these reason in thi research we us the fesi inf 2 inf element in our power gener experi photo 1 show fesi inf 2 inf thermoelectr power gener element k and i these ar produc by differ compani fig 4 on k element s power gener fig 5 ga temperatur in each block current voltag and output characterist of these singl element ar shown in fig 3 and 4 the reason why the output of i element is lower than that of k element is that it section area is smaller than that of k element result in an increas in intern resist when the convers design to make a section area of both element to be in the same size is perform both output were approxim on the same level us these element as shown in photo 2 we made an fesi inf 2 inf thermoelectr power gener design to convert solar energi into a primari energi and attach it to a lower part of the solar receiv thi gener consist of the first second and third block eight element ar attach around a stainless steel tube of each block measur 6 cm in diamet and 2mm in thick the power gener element s cold junction part is fix on a water cool copper plate photo 3 show the wai in which the interior of the power gener is view from the lower part the power gener element s p n junction is extrud in the central part touch a hot ga it is clear that a space between the junction and the stainless steel tube is insul by a heat resist blanket in the first block five layer of i element in the second block six layer of i element and in the third block four layer of k element a total of 120 element ar attach we conduct a thermoelectr power gener experi with sunlight focus on the solar receiv in thi experi we instal a thermocoupl devic in the center of the stainless steel tube and measur each layer s ga temperatur fig 5 plot shift ga temperatur and power gener element s cold junction temperatur by time indic clearli the stabil temperatur the lower part of the first block ha the highest temperatur and as we move upward we see temperatur gradual fall which make us think that a further studi on insul of the stainless steel tube side mai be necessari we conduct power gener experi by connect block in seri to measur current voltag and output characterist through resist load the result ar shown in fig 6 the highest output wa 2 7w fig 6 power gener characterist of thermoelectr fig 7 not reproduc show the relationship between electr current of high temperatur electrolyt cell made of solid zirconia electrolyt cover in our studi and impress voltag also shown in the diagram is a comparison of current voltag characterist of the thermoelectr power gener we can see from the chart that even with thi level of power gener capabl electrolysi progress and hydrogen ar be produc in order to increas the amount of hydrogen gener it will be necessari to increas power gener s output the power gener s current voltag characterist indic that high resist exist insid thi gener is curb output growth as shown in fig 8 an element develop recent ha a differ shape and ha the capac to gener nearli 1 w power incorpor of thi type of element into the gener will enabl us to obtain a greater output capac fig 8 power gener characterist of 4 conclus we have produc a highli effici solar receiv made of porou

civil s bandwagon the govern of king fahd bin abd al aziz custodian of the two holi mosqu ha built the king abd al aziz citi for scienc and technolog to be a scientif bastion that shoulder the respons of bolster and enhanc technolog so thi bastion will serv the kingdom s develop object although rel young the citi ha achiev numer accomplish in the area of research and technolog transfer to trace the march of the citi s accomplish and it futur plan and program the weekli ukaz conduct thi interview with dr salih al adhl chairman of the king abd al aziz citi for scienc and technolog thi interview ha gain an ad dimens with dr al adhl s return from abroad after he head the intern atom energi agenc s iaea gener confer it focus the light on the signific and import of the kingdom s select to head the confer scientif accomplish al zuman king abd al aziz s citi for scienc and technolog ha achiev numer scientif accomplish in variou field of technolog and research what ar your most promin current and futur plan al adhl we have 20 year plan five year plan and on year plan at present we have a project to produc hydrogen from solar energi it is be implement in cooper with the german ministri of scientif research and saudi univers thi is a pioneer project in the world especi in the field of solar energi we launch our effort in thi field even befor other countri contempl it the main problem in solar energi is the problem of storag which make it possibl to us thi energi as a fuel to gener energi we have complet the first phase and begun the second phase embodi in implement and in develop equip that us hydrogen to gener energi whether for cool for heat or for other purpos we have been abl to build a station that is the first of it kind in the arab world and africa name the saudi station for receiv photo from artifici satellit be thei the french the japanes or other satellit thi station is the most sophist accomplish achiev by scienc and technolog in thi field it cover an area that ha a diamet of 2 500 km thi station s photograph ar us in all area especi in explor natur resourc and in citi plan sinc thi station wa built we have develop a train program andr telescop and radio wave observatori we have other activ as well i do not look forward so much to the complet of these project as i look forward to the result for which we aspir result ar the most import thing we also have a laser have sent specialist to train on the us of thi technolog in the unit state the object is to secur train nation cadr remov from bureaucraci and red tape other project we have includ an earthquak observ network and the lunaproject we also have the research and comput institut which ha arab languag program we have a project to train the disabl to us comput we also have sever activ connect with automat translat through the us of comput regard the surveyor we now have arab languag survei program that make it easi to enter data all at onc all these project ar good but i look at the manpow compris of saudi youth and i hope that it possess a high degre of capabl becaus thi manpow is what last sincer and energet manpow is the most import element thi is why we will focu on youth train and develop program so that our young men will get higher degre i believ that thi is where we start lai the foundat on which we can build thi is someth of which we can be proud atom and water desalin al zuman at a confer held recent in vienna you said that the kingdom us the atom to desalin water can your excel tell us about thi program al adhl becaus we must not reli on a singl sourc of wealth we have decid to plan for the futur consid that avail of the oil energi cannot make us dispens with the search for altern so as to develop other sourc we have had to consid the long run the current circumst requir us to embrac certain polici that reflect the econom situat we have to have the technolog to desalin water to gener power and for us in the variou econom and social area we also have to have the capabl to deal with thi technolog nuclear energi ha it sever aspect includ the neg aspect of radiat and the possibl of radiat accid it also ha it peac aspect becaus problem have develop in the advanc countri that us nuclear energi we will be more conserv befor we embark on thi field despit all thi we must have the technic capabl first protect from radiat is veri import and we have made a stride in thi regard in the area of the peac us of the atom not true al zuman an accus wa made against the king abd al aziz scienc and technolog citi and those who made it believ that you ar close to the king sa ud univers but that you ar not as close to other academ circl al adhl thi is a misplac accus the citi is eager to have close cooper with all of the kingdom s univers and such cooper doe in fact exist even though the citi is special in technolog scienc special institut al zuman the citi ha establish a number of special scientif institut but we notic that there is a delai in develop program for these institut perhap your excel can shed light on these institut and their goal al adhl the citi perform three major and import task in support and promot scientif research throughout the kingdom first the citi seek to support research at univers and at privat and public sector academ and research center second the citi conduct appli scientif research third the citi coordin cooper between the kingdom and other countri in the area of scienc and technolog there is anoth axi connect with research by research center the main object is not to set up center but to conduct new research and to us the accomplish research to serv develop the object ar the same but the program must vari so as to serv thi effort we have to have flexibl and capabl it is not so easi to establish such institut becaus thei requir manpow build construct must be complet at the time when cadr becom avail we must have the main seed name qualifi youth and i must not be compel to conclud contract with foreign so there ha to be plan especi sinc it is not easi to creat a scientif establish which is not just a build thi is why we have built a multipurpos premis the exist research institut build wa construct to be a first phase nucleu of all these research institut each build is construct accord to a specif design and it becom a special institut when complet such as the energi and petroleum research build the petrochem industri build the space and astronomi build and the natur and environment scienc build al zuman it is notic that the citi is interest in pure scientif research and we find that human research is neglect despit it import what is your excel s comment on thi al adhl human research is import howev it is conduct at univers as plan a most import object of the citi s is to devot attent to appli research which requir laboratori and technician mean that that thi research ha a special characterist wherea human research is focus on research librari and so forth ye thi accus is true but there ar other institut in the kingdom which have a greater role in thi type of research al zuman the citi ha enjoi the attent of the custodian of the two holi mosqu as proven by thi equip and these enorm build but the question that obvious persist is what ha thi citi offer in return for all thi support al adhl some aspect mai be disclos and other mai not i have alreadi answer some point such as energi lunar observatori and so forth so i do not believ that the citi ha been lax it is true that on aspir for more but we do all we can within the limit of our resourc al zuman is there a plan to hold intern scientif symposium al adhl the citi particip in numer confer and symposium especi those of an appli natur next shawwal april the citi will hold a technolog symposium in cooper with the variou government sector the purpos will be to rais the question how can we improv our work have complet studi achiev their desir outcom or have thei been shelv awai and forgotten so our object behind thi symposium is to probe the aspect of failur if thei exist especi sinc develop is the object that we all seek we have invit guest from japan the unit state malaysia australia and china to particip in thi symposium so we can familiar ourselv with their experi we have also invit arab guest to particip and familiar us with their experi and with the method thei have emploi al zuman what is your evalu of the select of the kingdom repres in your person to head the iaea confer and how do you see the world commun s impress of the kingdom in thi regard al adhl there is no doubt that thi is the first time that an arab countri ha head the iaea gener confer if anyth thi choic show the place that the world commun give the kingdom in thi regard a place that truli reflect what the kingdom ha accomplish thi is testimoni for the kingdom from everybodi i would like to point out here that intern represent in the iaea gener congress is done on the basi of bloc there is the european bloc and the north and south america bloc the gener confer chairman is select annual thi chairmanship is altern annual between the variou bloc thu entitl a certain bloc to the annual chairmanship thi bloc select or nomin on of it member to the chairmanship and the gener confer then vote on the candid in some case thing proce smoothli and agreement is reach within the bloc to nomin just on countri to chair the confer in such a case approv by the gener confer is almost guarante but in other case on find that more than on countri is compet for the chairmanship the confer decid by vote thi time the kingdom sought the chairmanship the citi repres the kingdom in the iaea and the ambassador of the custodian of the two holi mosqu is the perman resid repres at the agenc royal approv wa given to the kingdom s nomin there were some countri that want to nomin themselv but thei decid to withdraw their candidaci out of appreci for the kingdom

credit munich with be the site of germani s most outstand fusion research but he also want to place larg scale project in the east sz sueddeutsch zeitung you did not get off scot free from the last round of cutback instead you ar now go to have to relinquish an addit 250 million mark from your tightli apport budget how ar you go to manag that without caus damag to german research krueger for me research polici is not onli a polici of subsidi but involv much more it effect cannot be secur just by monei alon the budget reduct in the feder ministri of research and technolog will probabl affect nearli all area in the area of personnel in the research instal howev we will hardli be abl to do ani econom also becaus of the legal commit in the 94th budget that mean that we will probabl have to econom more sharpli in the area of project fund in the area of invest in the area of materi and equip in research facil and with intern contribut sz you want to save even more on space travel in ani case than the minist of financ consid necessari krueger the budget is not determin by the feder minist of research alon but rather in the end by the parliament if it is up to me and my depart space travel will inde share in the cut back sz how doe it look for fusion research the decis on the w7x experi which the institut for plasma physic is veri interest in still ha to be made is the experi go to be done and if so where krueger i do believ that the w7x stellar experi will happen that is after all a project which is current be examin within the scope of the european fusion program and which if necessari could be sponsor via the eu so i believ that the resourc will be suffici also for a medium term realiz of the w7x sz where krueger sinc we ar plan to build a fusion site in greifswald greifswald will probabl be consid for thi we ar try over the long term to creat an innov landscap for research in eastern germani as well that also mean put some larg scale equip in the new state and not alwai just ad still more piec of equip to area which alreadi have a lot sz doe that mean that the max planck institut for plasma physic ha it futur alreadi behind it krueger i do not look at it that wai becaus outstand work ha been done here even if the stellar research is move to greifswald import larg scale equip for fusion research would remain in garch and would make preliminari work for the world wide iter project possibl sz what ar the scientist there suppos to do if thei do not get the new experi the larg iter test reactor is onli a hope apart from the fact that the next fusion reactor if it is oper with radioact tritium would have to be approv in accord with the atom energi law and accord to the explan of the spg social democrat parti of germani thi would not receiv major approv in germani krueger we ll have to wait and see about that i think that munich is current the most outstand site of fusion research in germani that greifswald could be a complement to munich possibl as part of the munich institut and the nuclear research center in karlsruh will continu to have a futur sz from what you ar not sai it follow that the juelich nuclear research instal no longer ha ani futur in fusion research krueger it ha not been final decid yet what will happen with juelich after the fusion experi which ar current run ar complet so i am not abl to sai anyth definit either sz what is your posit on the new atom reactor project in garch krueger first of all we need clear decis in bavaria in thi regard in addit we have to see what financ shortag we alreadi have now in the area of fund for univers or colleg construct a new research reactor would have to be financ veri substanti through the law to promot colleg construct we have announc support for when that time come of a firm invest cost subsidi of 160 million and an oper cost subsidi of 80 million mark and if the project doe becom definit we will make thi sum avail sz in the face of critic from the usa how do you as a politician at the feder level assess the problem of prolifer via the highli enrich nuclear fuel which is suppos to be us in garch krueger there ar no offici statement on the part of the american govern regard thi but we should not underestim the public discuss about it the german govern doe not see ani prolifer all of the nuclear fuel of the research reactor is complet subject to the secur measur of the european atom energi commun euratom and the intern atom energi agenc iaeo as soon as the frm concret realiti becom appar we should try veri quickli to reach a clarif of these question with the american govern sz you want to shorten the road from basic research to product for the market that lead among other thing to the situat that larg research facil which ar now suddenli suppos to be try for market ar in competit with the frauenhof institut which have tradition been there to carri out appli research krueger i do not see direct competit here sz it will be seen and spoken of that wai on both side krueger we want to help those section of the larg research facil which ar alreadi more orient toward applic to be given work which is line with our strategi which we recogn as

think a great deal about how we can support the basic requir for livelihood there is a whole seri of program for thi right now in the new state where the deficit is the greatest these special subsidi for technolog extend to support the start up of technolog orient busi sz subsidi also through the fmrt feder ministri of research and technolog krueger ye although i doubt that young graduat ar in the posit to alreadi be start busi what is import is that we in gener take more graduat into busi we ar current give intens thought to possibl also creat new incent in innov area in industri in order to be abl to place good graduat of colleg and univers sz how is your collabor work with the ministri of educ go krueger smoothli and well better coordin of the research facil would be necessari particularli the facil on the so call blue list sz sinc as you said at the begin you now necessarili have to limit project research a whole seri of small busi which live off of project in for exampl energi research for the ministri of research will either go under or substanti down size and will in ani case have to let peopl go krueger fund from the fmrt should in ani case onli be jump start financ not a long term subsidi i hope that through the mani measur we ar undertak we will help industri work more close with research facil and also with busi facil which ar activ in research i hope that we ar more success than we have been in the past sz would a chang in the guidelin for grant fund be necessari in thi regard krueger i hope that industri come to the posit of give awai more contract to third parti that is of us commiss or contract research more intens at thi point onli two percent of the total research expenditur of busi and industri is us for contract for research to third parti that seem to me to be too littl otherwis it cannot be the case that the govern at least with the budget reduct ha to see to it that privat research facil ar receiv project fund right along with public research facil sz on the other hand it is sure import that we do not thoughtlessli risk the expert knowledg we have avail and what you ar now allow to fall apart will take a long time to rebuild in better time krueger i can onli spend the monei that i have sz do you think that your demand that research expenditur be offset by tax begin in 1995 still ha a chanc and how should the financ minist who is then in offic balanc that out krueger we ar work on creat a preferenti system for research and develop with regard to tax how thi will look is current be work out among the feder

contact corros problem of aluminum steel with aluminum steel clad the uniqu featur of nissan s aq x is the adopt of an iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur by us an aluminum alloi for certain structur compon and for the outer and inner panel for it door front hood front fender and trunk lid instead of the aluminum alloi that is not suitabl for deep draw mold steel sheet ar us for the outer and inner panel of the rear fender which ha a sever curv surfac as a result of adopt the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur the weight of the aq x is approxim 20 percent less than that of previou bodi made of steel outer panel thi drastic weight reduct seem to indic that the adopt of the hybrid structur is expect to meet futur auto specif sinc accord to on offici no matter how much a bodi structur is ration the weight of the exist steel bodi will be reduc onli by sever percent at best gener whenev sheet steel and aluminum alloi part ar us togeth the joint ar attack by corros that result from the contact of dissimilar metal the corros is commonli call galvan corros and such joint have to be avoid altogeth in auto bodi construct therefor auto bodi part in which aluminum alloi can be us ar limit to such part as front hood trunk lid and hing part that function as a lid such as quickli detach sun roof otherwis like the nsx sport car of honda motor co ltd all the bodi ha to be made with an aluminum alloi with onli the smallest area of contact with steel nissan solv the problem of contact corros between steel and aluminum alloi for the aq x by insert steel aluminum alloi clad piec in the joint the steel aluminum alloi clad piec ar insert between an aluminum alloi outer panel and a steel inner panel when thei ar to be spot weld to form a monocoqu bodi the aluminum alloi layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel and the steel layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the steel inner panel befor the entir assembl is spot weld as a result aluminum is weld to aluminum and steel is weld to steel as a whole the aluminum outer panel and the steel inner panel ar bond to each other nissan is us the same cold roll steel panel spcd spce as that current in us and the aluminum magnesium base alloi no 5000 commonli call 30 30 i e tensil strength of 300 mpa or 30 kgf mm sup 2 and elong of 30 percent for the inner and outer panel respect onli on spot weld voltag is requir for spot weld steel to steel as well as aluminum to aluminum yoshitaka kurihara chief research at the vehicular research laboratori of nissan s gener research institut sai thi we chose the ratio of the aluminum alloi to the steel in the clad materi in such a wai that on voltag can do both weld job simultan clad materi have two atom layer of dissimilar metal arrang tightli next to each other so no air can infiltr between the two layer thu neither oxid nor reduct take place as a result no potenti differ is gener between the steel and aluminum alloi layer and that prevent ani corros process from take place between the two dissimilar metal nissan improv the bodi rigid of the aq x through both design and materi and accord to kurihara both bend and twist rigid ar 20 percent higher than those of previou car of the same class nissan successfulli prevent ani loss of rigid despit the incorpor of aluminum the gaug of the aluminum alloi sheet like that of previou aluminum alloi part wa made 1 4 time that of the sheet steel to maintain the same tensil rigid as that of a sheet steel bodi the separ of steel from aluminum in an auto bodi the critic process in the recycl of car to be dispos of wa made technic possibl by nissan for the aq x by heat to approxim 500 c a brittl intermetal compound is form at the interfac of the steel and aluminum alloi layer of the clad materi which make it easi to separ the two layer with light impact nissan believ that the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur is a weight reduct technolog with a high probabl of implement becaus the advantag of weight reduct can be balanc against the ad cost through the optim of the ratio of cheap sheet steel to lightweight aluminum alloi accord to kurihara as far as the cost problem is concern although it is difficult to make a thorough assess at thi time it appear that a certain cost increas is unavoid not onli doe the aluminum alloi cost approxim three time as much as the steel the ratio of the materi unit price x the ratio of the densiti but the product cost is also high for the aluminum alloi becaus the spot weld electrod s life is shorter for the alloi than for steel audi exhibit space frame car with aluminum bodi germani s audi motor corp exhibit an audi space frame asf car with a space frame structur assembl with aluminum alloi outer and inner panel audi plan to us thi asf model for the mass test product of the a8 which is to replac the current sold luxuri v8 the a8 is schedul to be introduc to the german market in mai 1994 although the price of the a8 ha not been announc it ha been rumor that the price will exce the price of the v8 of 11 4 million it is specul that the car could afford an all aluminum alloi bodi becaus of it high price statu and the moder product rate of approxim 2 400 vehicl per month most of todai s passeng car have a monocoqu bodi that function as the structur materi for outer and inner panel in contrast the frame alon of the space frame structur function as the structur compon for the bodi and outer panel ar primarili us as the exterior partit therefor the space frame structur ha the advantag of be abl to maintain rigid despit the adopt of materi less rigid than steel such as aluminum alloi and resin for the outer and inner panel anoth import advantag of the space frame structur is that it enabl the us of compar cheaper extrud materi for the frame structur compon extrud materi can be made with heavier gaug for us in spot that requir high rigid or thei can be made with thinner gaug for us in spot that requir low rigid furthermor even if section with insuffici rigid happen to be construct in a space frame structur made of extrud frame the weak can easili be compens for with stiffen rib for the space frame structur of the asf car exhibit at the show the lowest cost extrud materi wa us in the largest quantiti the next lowest cost die cast materi wa us in the next to largest quantiti and the highest cost roll materi wa us in the smallest quantiti howev base on the concept disclos in 1991 in which extrud frame materi were to be connect with a die cast bond materi for the asf concept model mani observ at the show seem to get the impress that the us rate of the extrud materi wa less than previous announc audi us an aluminum manganes silicon base alloi for the extrud materi and an aluminum silicon manganes base alloi for the vacuum die cast materi what attract the audienc s attent is the us of a press mold roll sheet materi in a complex shape for the part call the c pillar of the roof section of the asf car bodi the chassi of the asf car wa form by rivet the roof and panel such as door and fender that were made by press mold of aluminum alloi the panel were rivet instead of spot weld to produc bond strength that is higher by approxim 30 percent and to elimin the anti product environ element of spark which would be caus by weld approxim 70 percent of the bond wa done with rivet the rest wa

wa rel behind mitsubishi did not quit solv the problem inher in plastic bodi i e the usag of a recycl thermoplast resin for horizont outer panel with the hsr iv mitsubishi is said to be experi with a multilay thermoplast resin outer sheet in which a foam agent is sandwich between skin layer in order to increas the sheet gaug to gain suffici tensil rigid without sacrif weight reduct the most uniqu featur of the hsr iv wa the elastom elast aero tail that can tailor the shape of the tail end section to the run condit in order to modifi the aerodynam environ under normal condit the tail end is flat howev under certain run condit the tail end rise to form a triangular upheav i e the upheav function as an air spoiler that gener a downward forc to counterbal the buoyanc the car ha under high

thi time the durabl of the elastom wa drastic improv to the level of readi implement at the same time mitsubishi improv the design to make the upheav area smaller the tail section is cover with a skin like materi of a stretchabl special thermoplast elastom to form an upheav that is smooth and seamless detail of thi elastom have not yet been disclos although it is said to be a styren base elastom with maximum elong of 600 800 percent the kei for the elastom is the manifest of the durabl for repetit stretch a polyolefin base thermoplast resin call tpo a blend of polypropylen and ethylen propylen rubber epr had been us for the hsr iii sup 1 although the resin wa not durabl enough for the tail section to be commerci sachio miwa of the materi technolog depart sai that thi time mitsubishi in it experi achiev an elastom durabl that could cope with 3 000 4 000 repetit stretch which is equival to the 10 year of us therefor he continu it will be possibl to commerci the tail section in the next few year an approxim 100mm high upheav can be repeatedli form on the tail with a stretch of approxim 300 percent for the elastom in contrast to ordinari thermoplast elastom which show a nearli linear elong stress relationship thi particular elastom show a rubberlik nonlinear elong stress relationship by requir small stress when stretch by less than 100 percent and then suddenli increas the stress requir when elong exce 100 percent mitsubishi coat the tail with a urethan elast paint that could stretch up to 300 percent in order to be abl to cope with the elastom s

90s and mazda s rotari engin system which is design to be us for hydrogen burn car in the futur signific weight reduct through abund us of aluminum alloi for vq engin the vq engin is expect to be instal in ordinari car as earli as 1994 it is a v type engin with a displac of 2 3 liter the engin drew attent becaus it demonstr how much weight reduct fuel cost reduct and exhaust clean could be improv for the exist gasolin burn reciproc engin materi technolog wa fulli appli in an attempt to reduc the weight of the engin compar with the current vg engin the weight of the cylind block wa reduc by 29 kg or 50 percent in addit to a weight decreas of 5 kg or 17 percent in the primari move system and a total weight decreas of 9 kg or 19 percent for the move valv system plu the cylind head the drastic weight reduct of 50 percent for the cylind block wa achiev through the replac of the exist cast iron fc with the aluminum alloi adc 12 the block wa mold with a high pressur die cast machin instal at iwaki plant nissan s design state of the art engin plant although the machin is call a die cast machin it is a type of high pressur cast method with a slightli low cast pressur of approxim 100 mpa todai honda and mazda ar the onli automak that ar adopt a high pressur cast aluminum alloi for cylind block in 1982 nissan had adopt a high pressur cast product for the cylind block of the 1 liter displac engin for the then new model call march subsequ howev nissan us product made of aluminum alloi includ ac4b cast with a low pressur of approxim 1 mpa for cylind block in it campaign for alumin of larg engin high pressur could not be us for cast becaus sand mold had to be us to form the cool water passag thi problem wa solv for the vq engin by adopt an open deck type cast method without us the mold the cylind block for the vq engin had been design by cae for rigid construct as well as for the instal of cool water passag therefor accord to a spokesperson for the first power train design depart of the power train develop divis although the block ha an intric shape for high pressur cast the cast method wa chosen as a result of optim with cae fluid analysi the adc 12 high pressur cast product wa also us to make the compon that unit the oil pan and the lower crankcas situat under the cylind block unlik previou oil pan that were place below the cylind block mere as an attach thi compon also function as a structur compon to increas rigid of the overal engin becaus of thi an extra effort wa made to decreas the weight of the cylind block moreov the intric shape cylind block wa made of a low pressur cast product from ac4b the ideal wai to reduc the weight of an engin is to reduc the weight of the move part of an engin when part that undergo reciproc or rotari motion ar made light not onli is less drive energi requir but also the energi loss due to slide is reduc in addit the engin s revolut limit and respons will also increas therefor sai director kenichi sasaki of nissan the vq engin wa develop as the basic engin model that will be us for the next 15 year nissan also succeed in achiev a drastic weight reduct of approxim 20 percent for ac8a made piston that were made in a ration shape creat via the full us of cae in stress and heat flow analys similarli connect rod were also made lighter by reduc the diamet of the pin at their smaller end which ar link with the piston thi weight reduct wa possibl becaus of the reduct in the piston s weight and becaus of the improv fatigu strength that result from the creation of an appropri compress stress layer on the rod s surfac by hard shot peen hydrogen ga rotari car achiev 230 km cruis distanc for the last sever year mazda ha been energet develop a near futur engin in the form of a hydrogen ga rotari engin

energi resourc thu on the basi of china s concret condit we must consid china s energi resourc develop strategi china s characterist ar 1 a larg popul and 2 low energi resourc consumpt level at present each person in the develop countri consum an averag of more than 5 ton of standard coal a year the unit state ha alreadi surpass 10 ton wherea china s total energi resourc consumpt in 1992 wa about 1 1 billion ton of standard coal which when divid by our popul of 1 1 billion give a per capita figur of about 1 ton of standard coal coal account for about three fourth of the energi resourc we consum if an economi is to develop and peopl s live ar to be improv then per capita energi resourc consumpt must certainli increas howev thi increas must be restrict by variou factor such as resourc and environment restrict and so on in anoth 50 to 60 year when china s economi approach the level of the develop countri our popul will have grown to about 1 5 billion at that time even if we do not attain a per capita energi resourc consumpt of 5 ton of standard coal but will onli reach 3 ton china s total energi resourc consumpt would be 4 5 billion ton of standard coal in the present situat in which china onli consum 1 1 billion ton of standard coal a year china s atmospher discharg of sulfur oxid nitrogen oxid carbon dioxid and other pollut have alreadi approach the amount discharg in the unit state the world leader it is veri hard to envisag that in sever decad china will be produc transport and burn sever billion ton of coal becaus of the seriou impact thi would have on china s economi and the atmospher and environ todai we all live on the earth which we all depend on for our exist energi resourc develop strategi and polici have now cross over nation boundari and thei can affect not just the exist and develop of the peopl of on s own countri but have a worldwid impact as well thu when we ar studi china s energi resourc develop strategi we must look at balanc demand resourc financ and other condit and we must strive to maintain equilibrium among energi resourc product and consumpt and the ecolog and environ base on thi principl i feel that besid the need to acceler the develop of convent energi resourc in the short term china s energi resourc develop strategi should focu on two area first we must adopt import measur to increas energi resourc util effici us our present 1 1 billion ton of standard coal properli and us strategi to focu on energi conserv second we must develop non pollut renew energi resourc especi hydropow bioenergi wind energi and solar energi i conserv energi resourc increas energi resourc util effici the effici of energi resourc util in china is rather low at present with an overal effici of onli about 30 percent our energi consumpt per unit gnp is 6 to 10 time higher than in the advanc countri and our energi consumpt to produc a unit of product is 50 to 100 percent higher than in foreign countri there is consider potenti for us our present energi resourc well thu conserv of energi resourc is an import nation polici of our countri and should be adher to for a long time we must establish law and regul regard energi resourc util in product and consumpt we must make conserv energi and improv energi resourc util effici an import standard for check 1 we must make macro readjust in the industri structur and product mix and energet develop those industri and product with low energi consumpt and high product valu sever larg energi produc provinc such as shanxi and heilongjiang in china s interior have energi consumpt per unit of product valu more than five time higher than econom develop provinc along the coast such as jiangsu and zhejiang and two of the main reason ar the signific differ in their industri structur and product mix 2 we must requir that newli built enterpris and restaur hospit school resid and so on conform to new energi resourc consumpt standard have special personnel to conduct energi conserv inspect of these design and not approv the construct of those that do not meet the standard we certainli cannot build those that do not conform to energi conserv standard at the time thei ar be built and that will requir technic upgrad for energi conserv after thei ar place into us ration energi consumpt standard should be formul for all new energi consum product that go into product such as water pump blower electr motor refriger televis wash machin and so on and thei should be strictli examin and we should not permit the product of those that fail to meet requir those product that ar alreadi in product should attain energi consumpt standard within a limit period of time 3 we must focu on energi conserv and reduc consumpt in all industri in the electr power industri for exampl the averag amount of coal consum to suppli electr per kwh of power from thermal power plant in 1992 in china wa 420 gram of standard coal thi wa 10 gram lower than in 1990 but it is just 320 gram in advanc countri like japan itali and other and in the former soviet union becaus thei develop a larg number of heat and power cogener plant the amount of coal consum to suppli electr is even lower just 310 gram per kwh the former ministri of energi resourc point out that the amount of coal consum to suppli electr in china s thermal power plant should be reduc from 430 gram in 1990 to 360 gram in 2000 a reduct of 70 gram at that time thermal power in china will gener 1 trillion kwh of electr so thi could conserv about 140 million ton of coal the 360 gram index is not so high as to be unattain shitongk no 2 power plant import and built by the huaneng compani ha two 600mw gener that onli consum 300 gram kwh to suppli electr if all of china attain thi level by the 2020s and project china s thermal power output then at 3 trillion kwh thi could conserv 400 million ton of coal the state should formul a seri of polici to spur energi conserv in the electr power industri the most import among them is rais depreci rate in the electr power industri to ensur that a power plant s depreci capit over 15 year is suffici to enabl it to replac it equip in addit we must strengthen power plant manag and demand energi conserv result in manag enterpris that manufactur power gener equip should continu improv design and manufactur level and reduc coal consumpt in the power gener equip thei produc to less than 300 gram within 10 to 20 year in anoth exampl develop central heat suppli and heat and power cogener is an effect wai to rais energi resourc util effici and conserv energi resourc china ha over 500 000 industri boiler and heat boiler that burn up over 400 million ton of coal a year and each year we must add small boiler with over 10 000 ton of steam output becaus the capac of these boiler is too small it is veri difficult to achiev automat coal load for burn and it is veri hard to attain the design thermal effici level of larg and medium size boiler over 90 percent the result is high energi consumpt and low thermal effici which ad to the great difficulti in carri out dust remov in small boiler also result in substanti pollut even more regrett is that becaus thei have user of heat thei alreadi had good condit for creat energi conserv and reduc coal consumpt in thermal power plant but thei have not realli been util current the thermal effici in thermal power plant is onli about 35 percent and the main reason is the presenc of unavoid cold end loss in which nearli 60 percent of the heat energi is discharg into the atmospher if thei had user of thi heat thei could recov and util these loss to suppli heat which would greatli increas the overal thermal effici thi wa what the former soviet union did implement central heat suppli can turn scatter small boiler into larg and medium size boiler which can rais automat oper level improv boiler effici and rais dust remov level have larger boiler mean higher steam paramet and the steam can first be us to gener electr and then the steam that gener the electr can be suppli to heat user which mean heat and power cogener plant calcul and actual result show that adopt thi type of upgrad measur can conserv on half of the energi resourc the state plan commiss s energi conserv invest compani ha conduct experi at sever site nationwid with substanti benefit dandongbei chemic fiber plant for exampl replac over 50 scatter small boiler with three 70 t powder coal boiler and replac nearli 30 small smokestack with a larg smokestack fit with electr dust remov and it instal two 12mw back pressur type steam turbin gener thi small cogener plant burn the coal from it former 50 plu scatter small boiler to suppli heat and gener an addit 24mw of electr and it can conserv about 50 000 ton of coal a year while at the same time solv the region s long term atmospher pollut problem expert in china and foreign countri feel that heat and power cogener is an effect energi conserv measur the unit state origin had not extend cogener but to rais energi resourc util effici dure the carter administr it formul encourag polici substanti advanc in heat and power cogener in the unit state dure the past 10 year have rais the overal effici of energi resourc util to encourag and support the larg number of scatter heat suppli small boiler china now ha in upgrad to central heat suppli and cogener

energi resourc consumpt is miniscul and we should develop it quickli to gradual turn it into a forc in our energi resourc current the main problem in energet extend wind power electr gener is that the technolog for larg and medium size wind power gener in china is not matur and our equip must reli on import so manufactur cost ar high we must import internation matur technolog such as larg wind power gener with unit capac of 200 to 400 kw and organ larg batch domest product it is entir possibl to reduc the manufactur cost per unit kw to the present level for hydropow construct all countri of

solar energi to gener electr foreign countri have done a great deal of research and experiment work in recent year on util solar energi to gener electr and thei have made signific advanc and substanti reduc the cost of power gener thei have progress from monocrystallin to polycrystallin silicon and develop from polycrystallin silicon to non crystallin silicon and recent have also develop to crystal plate film and the photovolta convers effici ha risen from a few percent to over 10 percent now the total invest cost ha drop to 1 000 plu per kw as the technolog advanc develop solar power electr

electrochemistri at the univers of southampton england claim to have produc fusion energi from a simpl tabl top devic thei also said thei had produc more energi than it took to run their apparatu which would amount to a breakthrough that no on els in the world ha been abl to do despit the expenditur of hundr of million of dollar over the last three decad the announc wa met with what a spokesman for mit describ as extrem skeptic becaus the experi goe against the understand of the physic of fusion and it ha not been verifi by other scientist howev pon and fleischmann pick up some earli support fridai edward teller director emeritu of the lawrenc livermor laboratori and a legendari pioneer in fusion research said the experi sound extrem promis initi my opinion wa that it could never happen teller said i m extrem happi now becaus i see a veri good chanc that i wa complet wrong scientist at the livermor facil met with teller fridai to map their strategi for try to repeat the experi some other scientist howev treat the utah claim with incredul partli becaus the scientist announc their find through a press confer instead of publish their work in a profession journal where it would be subject to peer review that make you suspici said robert g sach professor emeritu of chemistri at the univers of chicago and a former director of the argonn nation laboratori similar claim sach recal similar claim nearli two decad ago from three independ research team in the unit state the soviet union and china us research thought thei had achiev fusion at room temperatur with a similar techniqu but sach said it turn out that the apparatu had somehow pick up high voltag from some other nearbi experi caus some fusion to occur in a veri ineffici system a coupl of year later he wa tour china and wa shown a tabl top apparatu he said thei said thei had produc fusion he said sach said he told the chines scientist about the earlier us experi and two week later thei abandon their experi after thei realiz thei were not get the result thei had thought pon and fleischmann have done their experi repeatedli over the last five year sometim for stretch of 100 hour and associ sai thei ar not like to have made that kind of mistak stan pon and martin fleischmann ar both brilliant said charl martin an electrochemist at texa a m i know them well he describ them as highli profession

he ad ask if he expect to duplic the experi he respond we re try it right now newspap account he said it will be sever dai at least befor he ha ani result martin and other scientist ar expect to have some difficulti repeat the experi becaus as sever scientist said fridai thei have to base their experi on newspap account becaus that ha been their onli sourc of inform pon and fleischmann ar expect to publish a paper on their work in about a month in the british journal natur caltech s barn said the result claim by the utah team should be fairli easi to check a few thousand dollar will get you a few quart of heavi water water enrich in a form of hydrogen call deuterium and a few hundr dollar will get you the palladium and platinum pon and fleischmann wrap a coil of platinum around a small cylind of palladium and insert it into a glass jar fill with heavi water thei said that when thei appli a small current to the apparatu the deuterium in the heavi water concentr in the palladium tightli enough to produc fusion most fusion research project ar far more elabor us reactor that heat the fuel to hundr of million of degre or power laser that caus fuel pellet to implod barn said the best wai to verifi the utah experi would be to set up a simpl apparatu similar to utah s and look for neutron as evid of the fusion reaction when deuterium nuclei fuse neutron should be releas fusion go on if you detect neutron that would tell you that you have fusion go on he said he said scientist at caltech were certainli talk about conduct their own experi appar so were a lot of other peopl norman brown director of technolog transfer at the univers of utah said he had been get so mani call that he final went home exhaust and took the phone off the hook on wa from teller s offic he said

stori headlin babi born with a wooden leg copi were past all over the chemistri build initi skeptic ronald j pugmir the univers s associ vice presid for research said he wa skeptic himself initi i didn t believ it becaus it defi the physic i knew about he said convent wisdom hold that fuel would have to be heat to temperatur far greater than the core of the sun for fusion to occur that is becaus deuterium nuclei have a posit charg and therefor would repel each other heat howev would energ the particl caus them to travel so fast that thei could bang into each other and fuse befor thei could push each other apart some experi have been conduct in cold fusion but that field wa not expect to lead to the creation of fusion power plant pugmir began to overcom hi skeptic after he did a lot of read and ask a lot of question he ad despit hi earlier doubt the onli conclus on could come to wa that fusion wa occur even mani of pon colleagu at the univers did not know of the experi until thursdai s press confer thei ve been keep it a pretti good secret said chemist peter armentrout i ve onli heard rumor but the implic ar so significantli extens that the secreci mai have been warrant some hazard meanwhil other scientist warn that attempt to reproduc the experi ar not without some hazard john sour a fusion research at the univers of rochest said that if the utah experi actual produc four watt of power as claim by the two scientist it would have also emit a danger level of radioact neutron particl it would requir some shield to prevent peopl in the vicin from be irradi he said you wouldn t put it out in the open but the process cannot be turn into an explos devic accord to fleischmann even though fusion is the process us in the hydrogen bomb i know of no wai you could

progress the effort ha continu unab becaus if the experi is confirm it could lead to an inexhaust suppli of cheap energi with seawat suppli the fuel scientist remain skeptic about the claim but score ar eagerli try to duplic the experi there is a grow convict that someth must be there even if it is not what the utah team believ b stanlei pon chairman of the univers of utah s depart of chemistri and martin fleischmann professor of electrochemistri at the univers of southampton england announc at a salt lake citi press confer last week that thei had succeed in produc nuclear fusion with a simpl apparatu that gener far more energi than it took to run it holi grail of research it is the latter part of the claim that ha tantal other scientist a nuclear fusion devic that produc more energi than it consum is the holi grail of energi research it is the long sought goal of score of research spend billion of dollar over the past three decad there is some evid now that the utah scientist were correct in insist that thei had achiev nuclear fusion but some scientist ar convinc that someth els possibl a chemic reaction must also have been at work if the experi produc more energi than it consum the strongest boost pon and fleischmann have receiv sinc their initi announc ha come from a physicist at brigham young univers in nearbi provo physicist steven jone ha carri on parallel research at brigham young but he ha refus to discuss it publicli until hi research is publish in a profession journal in mai he ha howev just made copi of hi report avail to other scientist ucla physicist robert conn review jone work and conclud that the brigham young professor had caus fusion to occur in a simpl devic similar to the on us by pon and fleischmann the fusion rate is higher than you would expect conn said of jone work but not nearli high enough to gener more energi than it take to run the experi jone ha never claim that hi experi led to a net increas in energi and he describ hi work earlier as mere of scientif interest conn describ jone research as carefulli done good accur solid stuff jone research would appear to be a partial confirm of the work done by pon and fleischmann in that it doe indic that some fusion is possibl with the simpl tabl top experi but it fall far short of suggest that the world s energi woe mai soon be at an end what puzzl mani scientist is the claim by pon and fleischmann that thei got more energi out than thei put in some of the scientist at lo alamo have work with both men and both ar held in high esteem the peopl who ar involv pon and fleischmann ar veri good chemist on lo alamo scientist said in a telephon interview on thing thei know how to do is to measur the power in and the power releas from the experi thei ar uniqu good at that the rel simplic of that measur plu the reput of pon and fleischmann have made it difficult to dismiss the claim if the chemist have er thei have er repeatedli over the past five year and their announc would repres a blunder of stagger proport that accord to scientist who know them well doe not seem like it is on of the reason scientist across the countri set out immedi to duplic the experi some smaller lab have given up but sever of the nation s most prestigi laboratori ar work intens on the experi some scientist were so intrigu that thei spent last weekend set up their own version of the experi at lawrenc livermor laboratori sourc at the lab said howev no on knew exactli how pon and fleischmann had carri out their experi so none of the hurri attempt led to success the utah team is withhold detail until their work is publish in a profession journal a decis that ha left other experiment with littl guidanc appar it take some time for fusion to begin to occur after the experi is start partli explain the delai in result but the biggest problem ha been the lack of specif detail concern how the experi wa carri out that situat ha chang at lawrenc livermor laboratori becaus edward teller a legendari figur in nuclear research step in and tri to fill some of the gap in a telephon interview pon said he talk person with teller who is the lab s director emeritu in an attempt to help scientist at livermor duplic the experi livermor scientist ar now try to verifi the experi but there have been no report of success meanwhil the harwel laboratori in england a research facil oper by

success with the latter charl r martin an electrochemist with texa a m told report mondai that we have confirm that more energi is produc by a simpl electrochem cell than is put into the cell thi is in agreement with the find of pon and fleischmann he ad we have run the experi us four differ amount of electr current and have found that excess energi vari between 60 and 80 martin said the experi began run at 1 a m saturdai and it ha been produc energi ever sinc ask if he believ the energi is produc by fusion he said i would have more confid if we could detect other symptom of fusion addit effort to determin whether fusion is caus the energi ar continu at the univers martin said still unclear if it is nuclear it is still unclear to us ad hi colleagu kenneth marsh a thermodynamicist whose expertis is in studi and measur the flow of heat which is the form of energi detect by pon and fleischmann the other member of the texa team is bruce gammon also a thermodynamicist while the texa research have not pinpoint the caus of the excess heat research at the georgia institut of technolog claim mondai to have detect neutron and tritium a radioact form of hydrogen from a similar experi on the atlanta campu on of the signatur of fusion is product of neutron so we felt that if we could detect neutron come from thi apparatu that would confirm fusion said jame mahaffei who led the five member georgia tech team our data convinc me that we ar make neutron in that vessel there is no wai to get neutron unless someth nuclear is go on the georgia team howev did not attempt to measur heat particularli puzzl in the texa a m work is the fact that research there found a net increas in energi almost immedi despit the fact that pon ha said it take mani dai for the apparatu to begin produc heat we were stun when their experi began produc excess heat almost immedi marsh said martin said later the electrod thei ar us is veri small and he said it probabl take less time for a smaller unit to begin produc energi than a larger on after thei first measur the excess heat the three men spent the next 30 hour in the laboratori try to analyz the surpris result by late sundai afternoon even though thei still were at a loss for an explan thei decid to call a press confer and reveal their find look fatigu but happi the three scientist said thei ar confid their result will hold up under scrutini becaus thei us a sophist system that is less prone to error than that us by the utah scientist the techniqu which elimin mani common error directli and continu measur ani temperatur chang reveal precis how much energi is go into the apparatu and how much is be produc martin said the energi output he said is rock steadi the apparatu us by the texa team is almost ident to the on us in utah it consist of an electrod with a palladium cylind on millimet in diamet and five centimet long surround by a fine platinum gauz the electrod is immers in heavi water which contain a heavi hydrogen ion call deuterium pon and fleischmann sai that when a small electr charg is appli to the electrod deuterium crowd into the palladium cylind so tightli that it is possibl for the nuclei to overcom their repuls electr charg and fuse releas heat if that is inde what is go on then neutron and other product should be releas in detect quantiti there have been scatter report of some success most notabl from a team at brigham young univers but in all those case there ar also mark differ with the pon fleischmann experi the brigham young and georgia tech scientist for exampl did not detect ani excess heat replic remain elus the feedback we ar get is that nobodi ha succeed in fulli replic the utah experi said plasma physicist keith thomassen of the lawrenc livermor laboratori none of the major nation laboratori he ad ha report find neutron that mai be partli becaus detail of the experi ar still not well understood thomassen said pon said addit detail will be publish soon in a major scienc journal most lab ar like us thomassen said thei ar still feel not total inform we re get bit and piec of info but not the kind i would have expect after two week the question ar not all answer he note that pon and fleischmann work on their research for more than five year so presum thei must have made mani refin over the year and some subtl variat could make a lot of differ for exampl scientist at livermor who were work on the experi thought thei had someth recent when their neutron counter began regist a signific increas in neutron which should be produc by fusion but it wa quit warm in the area becaus of nearbi electron equip so somebodi brought in a fan thomassen said neutron count drop shortli after the fan wa turn on the neutron count drop back to normal the warmth in the room had caus the neutron detector to drift out of calibr indic that far more neutron were be emit than wa the case it s easi to be fool thomassen said he ad that although the heat detect by the texa team is intrigu it leav us grasp for straw the texa expert were also grasp a littl mondai thi is a veri unusu result and we have not total dismiss the possibl of some unusu chemic process which we have not account for martin said in the press confer we ar current explor thi possibl further pon ha insist that the heat gener by hi experi could onli come from fusion becaus there is no chemic process that could have gener that much excess energi at on point he said earlier the heat wa great enough to vapor the electrod so it had to be hotter than 2829 degre fahrenheit martin howev wa not will to make that leap we don t feel qualifi to discuss fusion he said perhap the most troubl aspect of the entir episod ha been the inabl of major laboratori to duplic the experi in everi wai livermor s thomassen note that it should be easier to repeat the experi than prove it is not true sinc it is difficult to prove a neg unless someon succe soon he said the process could take month the

a fusion reaction physicist object to their conclus howev note that the amount of fusion necessari to produc the heat thei observ would have yield at least a billion time more tritium and neutron than thei detect the recent claim of confirm from texa georgia and moscow ar make other research more confid that pon and fleischmann have observ a real effect but we can t think of what the mechan can be yeager said ask about the difficulti other research have had in duplic hi result pon note that i have said all along that it would take a coupl of week after peopl got the detail of our experi it s

that purportedli achiev nuclear fusion at room temperatur although there have been scatter confirm of part of the experi announc a month ago at the univers of utah no us laboratori ha been abl to verifi the entir experi not even on of the major research laboratori best equip to repeat the experi ha succeed that includ nation laboratori at lo alamo brookhaven and livermor that ar in the forefront of energi research doubt remain that track record is why mani of the nation s top scientist remain doubt that b stanlei pon of the univers of utah and martin fleischmann of the univers of southampton england realli did achiev fusion in a flask as thei claim on march 23 at thi point no matter which wai it turn out thi scientif mysteri will go down as on of the most unusu chapter in the histori of scienc either pon and fleischmann both of whom have solid reput in the field of electrochemistri have commit a blunder of extraordinari proport or the best and the brightest mind in energi research have been befuddl by an experi that look so simpl it would not be a seriou challeng for a freshman chemistri student recent a team at stanford univers announc that it ha detect excess heat that cannot be caus by a chemic reaction and therefor is most like nuclear in natur and anoth team at the univers of florida ha detect signific amount of tritium a hydrogen isotop that is produc in fusion reaction but those claim of success onli add to the frustrat of other scientist who have been skunk in the race to repeat the experi nowher is that more appar than at caltech where a multifacet team of expert ha labor in vain to come up with someth that would either prove or disprov the utah claim last fridai afternoon a seminar on cold fusion had to be move from a classroom to the campu largest auditorium to accommod a crowd of sever hundr mani of those who show up rush to the front row of the auditorium expect to see a demonstr of the fusion experi but electrochemist nathan lewi shatter that dream in an instant our result he said as he face the pack auditorium rather sheepishli ar zero to continu effort scientist there will continu their effort howev detail of the work at caltech which were disclos at the seminar ar embargo until the scientist publish report in profession journal but the human drama reveal at the session mai be of greater interest anywai research at caltech began work on the problem within hour of the salt lake citi press confer and we ve been work pretti much around the clock ever sinc lewi told the seminar score of experi have been complet as the scientist there tri to guess exactli how the utah group had set up the experi from the begin research have been hamper by a lack of detail a shortfal that grow more puzzl as time goe on it the experi could easili be defin but it hasn t lewi said we re frustrat about that show exasper at on point he ask in exasper why pon ha not taken on of hi experi to on of the major nation laboratori and ask scientist there to test it with their sophist equip why not he ask when everybodi know thei were first now pon could not be reach becaus even though he ha us the media to stake hi claim he now declin interview while pon ha not taken on of hi experi to a major lab hi partner ha fleischmann is a consult to england s harwel laboratori oper by that countri s atom energi author and he ha taken some of hi own experi there for further test howev harwel offici have declin all comment until their research is complet which could take at least anoth month these dai as scientist who have grown weari from long night in the laboratori try to explain their inabl to replic the experi touch of bitter often surfac dure the caltech seminar speaker were frequent interrupt by applaus and cheer when thei suggest repeatedli that pon and fleischmann were so eager to claim credit for their work that thei made their announc prematur and that their work wa serious flaw not answer question much of the critic stem from the fact that utah research have still not answer some of the basic question other scientist have been ask about the experi not everyon at the caltech seminar wa readi to write off pon and fleischmann howev what thei ar sai on colleagu mutter to anoth as thei left the auditorium is if you gui ar so smart figur it out for yourselv if other claim from reput institut ar to be believ some peopl have done just that the most difficult research for the doubter to dismiss at thi point come from stanford univers a seven member team led by materi scienc professor robert a huggin announc last tuesdai that a seri of carefulli control experi there had confirm that the utah experi doe produc excess energi in the form of heat us heavi water furthermor onli experi that us heavi water that ha the isotop necessari for fusion produc the heat control experi that us ordinari water produc no energi thu rule out the chanc that the heat wa caus by some form of chemic reaction when lewi wa ask about the stanford result in the caltech seminar he shrug and said he huggin is a good gui but he said he did not know enough about the stanford work to comment further the differ between stanford and caltech suggest that there is some littl secret about the experi that stanford research have figur out otherwis stanford will join a list of institut that have announc success and then had to back off both texa a m and the georgia institut of technolog have had to buri their pride and admit that earlier claim of success were in error becaus of problem with equip that backped illustr on of the other frustrat of the project while the experi itself look easi detect the result is extrem difficult devilish bit of ironi and in that there is a devilish bit of ironi the law of physic as now understood suggest that pon and fleischmann would not have been around to hold their press confer if thei had achiev the level of nuclear fusion that thei claim said caltech physicist charl barn the experi should have becom so radioact that it would have been lethal to anyon within about a mile unless properli shield howev the experi produc so littl radioact that it is not even necessari to shield it and thu is veri difficult to measur accord to the utah scientist and that to physicist is the biggest mysteri of all scientist ar still search for a credibl explan of why the experi suppress the radioact that should be the signatur of a fusion reaction pon and other have theoriz that the energi produc by the reaction is absorb in the apparatu and releas as heat instead of high energi neutron or gamma rai but other scientist find that explan difficult to accept a curiou event anoth scientist at mit came up with a theori similar to pon lead to on of the most curiou event in the entir drama top scientist at mit had announc a coupl of week ago that thei were abandon their effort to replic the experi becaus thei had been unabl to valid ani of the utah claim but when a colleagu announc that he could explain how the experi work mit did a back flip and announc that it wa go to patent the theori for a process that other mit scientist had conclud doesn t even work and so it ha gone week after week it mai be month befor all the answer ar known although pon is now work with a team of about 60 peopl at lo alamo nation laboratori offer some promis of an earli resolut lo alamo like just about everybodi els ha been unsuccess in it effort to replic the experi on it own but the scientist who is lead that team said the lack of success ha not diminish the interest in the pon

LA061689-0035: british give up brand cold fusion a mad idea in a move that virtual buri hope for cold fusion the british atom energi author said thursdai it ha abandon effort to replic a controversi utah experi and brand claim of achiev fusion in a flask a mad idea the decis by britain s harwel laboratori is particularli signific becaus on of the scientist who made the startl announc in salt lake citi last march is a consult to the lab and made materi he had us in the utah research avail to hi british colleagu in addit the scientist milton fleischmann work with the harwel team in an effort to repeat the result he claim to have achiev with fellow electrochemist b stanlei pon of the univers of utah ten scientist work full time at the lab locat near oxford and more than 100 other particip from time to time accord to david william who head the effort in all thei tri 125 variat of the experi over a three month period and spent more than 486 000 but in the end their highli sophist instrument detect no excess heat which would have demonstr the energi produc potenti of the experi and thei found no neutron which would have prove that fusion wa take place it all ad up to a devast blow to cold fusion enthusiast becaus it wa wide believ that harwel with fleischmann s full cooper had the best chanc of confirm the utah experi which had held the promis of end the planet s energi woe we simpli have to stop becaus we can t think of anyth els to do at the moment william told report thursdai but he ad that the experi clearli document that cold fusion wa not take place in a refer to fleischmann he ad when brilliant peopl have mad idea it can come down on them like a ton of brick what s happen here is that a brilliant man ha had a mad idea fleischmann wa out of town for a coupl of dai and could not be reach accord to a man who answer the phone at hi london resid pon could not be reach in salt lake citi either the univers of utah said he is in london but jame j brophi vice presid for research at the univers of utah said the univers continu to support the claim of pon and fleischmann brophi said he wa at a loss to explain why fleischmann s colleagu in england could not repeat the experi even though thei had a palladium electrod suppli by fleischmann the electrod wa part of a simpl tabl top experi that the univers of utah had claim offer a clean virtual inexhaust sourc of energi disappoint in utah it is disappoint that thei have not been abl to do the experi properli brophi said in a telephon interview the startl announc last march sent shock wave through the scientif world thousand of expert around the globe drop whatev thei were do and turn their attent to the experi although most scientist were skeptic from the begin oddli a number of laboratori and institut worldwid report partial confirm of the utah experi although no on wa abl to duplic all the result claim by pon and fleischmann why some have claim partial success while mani other have fail remain a mysteri some such as the georgia institut of technolog report confirm of the experi onli to have to back off dai later and admit failur but other includ scientist and engin at texa a m and stanford univers have report result that so far have defi explan we ar get posit result said a john applebi director of the electrochem center at texa a m but the result ar not alwai the same ad more mysteri to what will sure rank as on of the most unusu chapter in the histori of scienc sometim applebi said in a telephon interview thursdai the electrod produc tritium a byproduct of fusion but other scientist with ident electrod on other part of the colleg station campu ar unabl to get the same result some experi at texa a m have also produc excess heat but other experi on the same campu have not someth seem to be happen that doe not conform to convent understand of either chemistri or physic he ad i m not sai i believ in cold fusion he said but we have heat we can t explain by normal mean other research institut includ the lo alamo nation laboratori have report some evid of fusion in electrod like those us by pon and fleischmann but not nearli on a scale that would suggest that the process ha ani applic in the product of energi instead the lo alamo result tend to support the far less extravag claim of anoth utah scientist steven e jone of brigham young univers jone claim that he ha caus atom of deuterium a heavi form of hydrogen to fuse in a palladium electrod but the reaction is veri weak and doe not produc excess heat there is grow support for jone work although most physicist ar still mystifi over how fusion could occur unless it is heat to temperatur equival to the core of the sun jone as well as pon and fleischmann have claim that fusion occur at room temperatur when an electr current wa pass through an electrod immers in water that had been enrich with deuterium but unlik pon and fleischmann jone doe not claim that hi experi can ever be us to produc energi the march announc by pon and fleischmann dure a salt lake citi press confer sent scientist scurri to their laboratori sinc both men had solid reput in electrochemistri even if thei were a bit out of their field in claim to have achiev a histor breakthrough in physic what follow wa a bizarr seri of event becaus pon and fleischmann us a magic word fusion to explain a process thei admit thei did not fulli understand it set off a chain reaction among scientist who have long dream of har the energi that power the sun had thei not claim that the heat thei were see wa produc by fusion note ucla nuclear engin robert conn none of thi brouhaha would have occur miss signatur the problem for physicist from the begin wa that none of the signatur of fusion were present had fusion been take place for exampl it should have produc a lethal dose of neutron when other scientist point that out pon and fleischmann respond that the fusion wa mysteri benign creat four time as much energi as it consum but not produc the danger byproduct associ with fusion that meant that other scientist had to search for a mysteri nuclear reaction that did not carri the normal signatur of fusion by thursdai men such as ucla conn were sai that the chase had end pon and fleischmann mai have seen someth that convinc them that thei were produc energi from fusion he said but it wa not fusion the fundament signatur isn t there conn ad meanwhil halfwai around the world the scientist who direct the harwel lab s effort and ha work with fleischmann for year spoke of the burden that will have to be carri by a friend who came up with a mad idea martin fleischmann is a veri veri clever man and he ha these idea all the time david william told report but not everi mad idea work out mayb thi on ha and mayb it hasn t it certainli hasn t work out for us i think the sad thing is that there ha been thi amaz hyster overreact certainli in america

feminin attract look ahead to the 90s to next season at least i think we ll see a move awai from thi power dress the aggress look the word i m hear is soft women want to look more feminin prettier less of a uniform approach more of a person style at the same time the athlet more relax approach is go to be veri import in the most recent collect we saw veri chic jacket thrown over a kind of
