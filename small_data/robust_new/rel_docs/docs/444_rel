the develop of scienc and technolog for the next 10 to 30 year is an import histor task 2 in the past 40 year china s s t activ have made world famou achiev china now ha 10 9 million natur scienc and technolog personnel includ 1 05 million who ar involv in research and develop we have over 5 000 independ research and develop organ and there ar over 7 000 r d organ under the jurisdict of enterpris thei have form a rel complet s t system that ha made sever world recogn major s t achiev china ha reli mainli on it own forc to solv mani import s t problem in econom construct nation defens and social develop thi is particularli true of the past 10 plu year of reform and open up when china ha readjust it s t develop principl and made breakthrough advanc in reform of the s t system organ attack on kei s t problem extend s t achiev spur s t progress in rural area promot develop of high and new tech industri strengthen intern s t cooper and exchang and other area 3 dure the cours of develop s t work for more than 40 year we have accumul rich experi and mani lesson our main experi ar on s t work must adher to leadership of the communist parti and to the socialist road two adher to reform and open up while perfect plan manag we have strengthen the role of market regul acceler the transfer of s t achiev into product and promot the integr of s t with the economi on the basi of independ and make our own decis we have activ absorb advanc experi and s t achiev from foreign countri and acceler the develop of s t in china three under the unifi leadership of the state we have concentr manpow and materi to organ attack on major s t task in nation econom construct and social develop four while foster the backbon role of our special s t staff we have been concern with integr special scientif research work and mass technic innov and integr lead cadr with s t personnel worker and peasant to jointli spur applic of s t achiev and popular of s t knowledg and improv the scientif and cultur qualiti of all nation our main lesson ar on the guid ideolog and actual work in econom and social develop have not alwai put promot of s t progress in an import strateg posit two econom develop lack mechan and intern motiv forc for reli on s t progress s t develop lack vital in orient toward econom construct and larg number of technic achiev cannot be convert into forc of product which ha result in a certain degre of detach of s t from econom and social develop and an inabl to fulli foster the potenti of scienc and technolog third in s t work there is a lack of unifi arrang and a ration divis of labor as well as the univers exist of repeat problem at low level the phenomena of detach from our nation condit blindli push forward and catch up and press urgent for achiev have also occur at time four major error have occur in polici toward intellectu that have damag the initi and creativ of s t personnel and affect the healthi growth of our s t staff a social climat of respect knowledg and respect skill personnel ha not been form 4 s t work must be orient toward modern toward the world and toward the futur todai s new s t revolut that is develop in a burgeon manner in the world ha caus s t to permeat everi realm of human societi in an unpreced wai which ha spur an enorm takeoff of the social forc of product and engend profound chang in the configur of the world the degre to which econom and social develop in each countri is depend on s t progress is increas overlap and intersect of basic research appli research and technolog develop ha appear schedul for convert technic achiev into commod product have continu shorten and the relationship among s t educ and product ar becom closer look toward the world s s t develop over the next 10 to 30 year major breakthrough will happen in sever emerg s t field and new product technolog and new understand of natur phenomena will have profound impact on the develop of human societi the develop of high and new technolog will further transform the face of exist industri and becom a major factor in world econom competit the world s econom develop and s t progress ar now move toward internation and s t competit is increasingli becom a decis factor in intern econom competit at the same time mankind must strengthen intern cooper to solv global problem like popul the environ resourc disast and so on that it face in common no countri can achiev modern in a close state 5 china s s t develop must begin with our nation condit china ha a larg popul a weak foundat and underdevelop social forc of product some 80 percent of our popul live in rural area and we will remain in the initi stage of social for a rather long period of histori into the futur china s econom and social develop is face restrict by our popul resourc environ and other factor our popul ha alreadi surpass 1 1 billion and even if we strictli control it rate of growth it will still grow to 1 5 billion by the 2020 s although china ha rather abund total amount of most resourc thei ar rel insuffici in term of per capita amount of resourc compar to the world averag we have on third the per capita cultiv land area on fourth the freshwat resourc on fifth the afforest area and onli on half the energi resourc environment pollut and ecolog destruct alreadi constitut seriou threat to our econom and social develop for a long time china ha been reli on the consumpt of larg amount of resourc to develop our economi technolog and manag in most industri ar backward the qualiti of product is poor and econom result ar low china is on of the world s nation have the highest amount of energi consum per unit valu of output and social labor product is equival to onli about 5 percent of advanc world level in the final analysi these discrep ar discrep in s t level educ level and manag level if we still lack a sens of crisi and urgenc and do not do everyth we can to catch up the discrep will not shrink and thei mai even expand the object of china s socialist modern and construct will be in danger of fall through and we will not have the place in the world that we should have 6 the kei to modern our nation economi and significantli rais labor product is modern of scienc and technolog we must certainli foster to the greatest possibl extent the role of s t as the first forc of product respect knowledg and skill personnel and more conscious shift econom construct onto the track of reli on s t progress and improv the qualiti of labor thi import decis is an indic of an histor chang in china s s t econom and social develop strategi and is import for achiev our goal of struggl for the remaind of thi centuri and into the next on look toward the futur we must have a sober understand of the seriou situat look more toward the favor factor and confid meet the challeng we now have substanti s t forc that have gain mani success experi even more import is that 10 year of reform and open up have brought vigor and vital to our econom and s t develop if we just conscienti adher to the parti s basic line fulli foster the role of s t as the first forc of product inspir enthusiasm and unit in struggl we can certainli acceler the develop of the social forc of product throw off our poverti and backward and achiev our magnific goal of modern to fulli illustr the superior of the socialist system ii

amount these natur materi ar capabl of assum quit unusu properti in the supercrit state for exampl thei can replac solvent that ar harm to the environ and can break down extrem stubborn ecolog poison even chemic stabl harm substanc can be broken down into co sub 2 and water when liquid or gase ar heat beyond their respect critic temperatur and critic pressur thei undergo a surpris metamorphosi thei lose their typic properti and take on entir differ on the extraordinari solvent power thei possess in thi supercrit state is extrem interest for the technolog field dr helmut schmieder of the institut for hot chemistri at the nuclear research center kfz in karlsruh explain water becom a univers solvent for organ compound under such condit with respect to their densiti the supercrit media scientist design as fluid ar similar to liquid although their molecul move as rapidli as ga particl fluid therefor surpass all other liquid or gase in the rate of their solvent process the best known such process introduc throughout the world is the remov of caffein by mean of supercrit carbon dioxid professor helmut tiltscher at munich s technic univers observ that problemat solvent like methylen dichlorid benzen and toluen which had been us previous can now be replac carbon dioxid enjoi the greatest advantag as a supercrit extract agent by virtu of the fact that it alreadi achiev the solvent properti of a fluid at a temperatur of 31 c and a pressur of 74 bar in recent year these environ friendli and time save extract have undergon rapid develop in the unit state especi in the food industri where to a great extent the us of halogen hydrocarbon is forbidden in thi wai the fat content of food sold as dietari aid is reduc these process ar us to remov up to 80 of the cholesterol from powder egg and to deriv aromat substanc from herb the pharmaceut industri is current test a supercrit carbon dioxid extract process to purifi vitamin e the process could replac vacuum distil which ha been requir to date but which with it temperatur of 200 entail the danger of thermal decomposit carbon dioxid is nontox as a solvent and it can be easili separ again from the dissolv substanc after the reaction by mean of relax these supercrit process ar be increasingli us to separ organ toxin or oil out of sewag and contamin solid in laboratori test research in the nuclear research center have now succeed in almost complet separ the grind oil from the sludg which build up dure glass process from the rub off glass powder in so do schmieder conclud noth more prevent the grind oil from be reus previous almost dm1 000 per ton had to be spent to dispos of the sludg in dump similar experi ar also underwai in karlsruh to recov the same oil from metal grind sludg about 150 000 ton of such sludg accumul yearli in germani reaction in supercrit water offer a new altern for the destruct of highli toxic wast materi water onli reach the fluid state at a temperatur of at least 374 c and a pressur of 221 bar it not onli becom a good solvent for organ harm substanc but is also mix thoroughli with the air or oxygen under these condit the substanc dissolv in the water oxid and ar therefor destroi in second sever laboratori in germani and the unit state ar now studi supercrit oxid as a mean of dispos of harm substanc the karlsruh nuclear research center ha develop a pilot plant oper at 500 c and a pressur of 250 bar with an hourli through put of 10 wateri media the content of harm substanc must not exce 10 the system requir veri littl space the 15 m long karlsruh tube reactor onli ha an inner diamet of 9 mm with the word unlik inciner these reaction take place in a close contain schmieder describ a consider advantag of the process name in that no harm substanc can escap while in the subcrit state in wet oxid the harm substanc ar onli partial decompos in the supercrit process up to 98 of stubborn wast materi like polychlorin biphenyl pcb explos materi and chemic agent decompos the organ skeleton is complet oxid into carbon dioxid and water no nitrogen oxid ar form sinc the organ bound nitrogen is transform mostli into molecular nitrogen sulfur phosphoru and halogen occur as acid or salt these anorgan salt ar not solubl in the supercrit water thei settl on the vascular wall and still constitut process difficulti the greatest problem is the massiv corros attack which even nickel base alloi find difficult to resist professor siegfri leistikow materi expert at the karlsruh nuclear research center elabor the supercrit media ar extrem aggress although hope exist for a solut through the us of line made of nobl metal but in so do the system becom more expens howev the cost even out sinc the reactor ar so small tiltscher reckon tiltscher see the best chanc for the process in special applic like byproduct from the product of medicin chemic from the varnish and paint industri pesticid the effort of the variou laboratori and pilot oper in the fraunhof institut for chemic technolog ict in pfinztal ar concentr on the decomposit of halogen hydrocarbon nitro and amino aromat like plastic professor michael model of framingham massachusett believ that sewag sludg ar an ideal object for supercrit water oxid have a solid materi compon of under 10 thei ar just right for thi process model is professor emeritu at the massachusett institut of technolog at which the base for the elimin of harm substanc in supercrit water were develop he claim that in laboratori condit he can prevent the cake of salt and therefor prevent corros by undertak certain construct measur the first commerci plant ar schedul for thi year the attempt to clean heavili contamin soil by mean of supercrit water is be tackl by professor gustav brunner in hamburg harburg the soil is place in the system as a fix bed and then irrig by the fluid the supercrit water ha to handl a dual role in the process brunner explain first it ha to rid the soil of as mani hydrocarbon as possibl and second

comput code addition sai mr barrett turbin clearanc the gap between the tip of the blade and the case have been made much tighter to reduc steam leakag and seal have been improv a second veri import trend in steam turbin is toward reduc size of the overal machin thu lower the cost for the util and the space requir to site the turbin a typic 500mw steam turbin in us in the uk might have on high pressur turbin case on intermedi and three low pressur case but modern design make it possibl to have a combin high intermedi turbin and a singl low pressur section sai mr barrett a number of produc point out the signific for thi trend of the abil to make longer blade or bucket for the last low pressur stage of the turbin due to new manufactur method and materi especi titanium longer blade have the effect of increas the exhaust area and thu remov the need for two low pressur stage titanium blade and bucket up to 1360mm ar avail such as the last stage bucket on ge steam turbin for a tokyo electr power nuclear plant for larger turbin thi trend mean that turbin which were previous configur as three case machin with four steam flow can now be configur as two case doubl flow machin sai ge similarli the output of the smaller singl flow singl case unit ha been increas all these trend have an impact on the repow market as well as that for new equip siemen cite the exampl of it replac of the low pressur steam turbin in the 1300mw unterwes nuclear power station near bremen increas output by more than 50mw at constant thermal power of the reactor the plant s total effici wa increas from 35 per cent to 36 5 per cent through the addit of on blade row per flow advanc blade profil for all stage and the optimis of the exhaust flow condit all the produc believ there ar further opportun for improv the effici of steam turbin mr barrett sai the technolog ha yet to reach the point of diminish return the next few year seem like to see a continu of the present focu on improv effici and compact or power densiti as it is known it is hard to come up with a quantum leap on the steam side sai mr del williamson at ge steam turbin will therefor make some contribut to on of the biggest technolog challeng for the power equip industri further improv the thermal effici of combin cycl power which is current hover at about 55 per cent effici gain could come either from the ga turbin or the steam turbin sai mr williamson competitor agre although the major feel that as befit a less matur technolog the effici of ga turbin will probabl rise faster
