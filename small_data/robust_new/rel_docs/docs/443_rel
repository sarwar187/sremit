FBIS3-1408: languag english articl type bfn interview with anc spokesman carl niehau and freedom front spokesman gener tieni groenewald by sabc announc lesli mashokw on the newslin program date not given live text mashokw good even and welcom to newslin tonight in our program we focu on the manifesto of the freedom front and the african nation congress anc later on the two parti debat these manifesto the question of a volkstaat afrikan homeland rais a lot of eyebrow when it wa first moot and it remain on of the most contenti issu to come to the fore in recent year i am now be join by the freedom front s gener tieni groenewald and the anc carl niehau good even gentlemen and welcom what is the real state of affair ar we go to have a volkstaat mr nelson mandela proclaim that dure hi lifetim there will never be a volkstaat what is the latest niehau well lesli the import issu is whether we ar keen to address the concern that everyon in thi countri ha of differ languag and differ cultur the anc sai we ar we ar keen to try and work out a feasibl and a workabl plan on how to address these concern you know thi is not a new thing we had said sinc 1955 that all the languag and all the cultur in thi countri must be abl to grow and develop but we also sai there ar practic wai of do it and there ar impract approach and an impract approach is to insist on a geograph area a specif piec of land and the reason why we sai that is veri simpl not becaus we try to deni anyon in thi countri their right their cultur their languag but becaus the realiti is that nowher in south africa ar the afrikan or that group of the afrikan who support a volkstaat and thei ar a minor even amongst afrikan nowher ar thei in the major in ani geograph area and the citizen mashokw interrupt okai but niehau continu can i just conclud thi becaus it s crucial the peopl who live in that area ar in everi area the major ar black peopl and what i hear from the afrikan volksfront nation front is that those peopl will not be abl to have full citizenship thei won t have vote right thei will be in a posit of second class citizen that is unaccept the anc had fought sinc 1912 for nonraci for an inclus democraci which will grant right to everyon we cannot now come and grant right to on group to the detriment at the cost of the major of our peopl mashokw tieni groenewald the anc manifesto sai the land belong to all who live in it in a wai it is an inclus document which seem to be address some of your concern groenewald you d like my comment on the anc statement that the land belong to everyon certainli we do not deni that but in south africa we have all three major caus for conflict there ar onli three caus for conflict the first is disput over territori secondli disput over ethnic or nation and thirdli disput over religion or ideolog there is not on singl unitari state in the whole world where these three caus of conflict ar present in state that ar democrat state the onli state where thi occur wa where you had a dictatorship such as the old soviet union and in yugoslavia and the moment you impos a democraci these state fell apart which prove on thing that when the caus of conflict ar present and the three caus of conflict ar present in ani particular state then you must look at a differ dispens now in thi respect what we ve done in south africa is we have been led by the ideolog think and the constitut think mainli from the communist sphere of influenc on the on side and secondli by american think as to what is good for south africa we never look at the european exampl exampl such as switzerland exampl such as belgium now if we take those exampl we find that these were countri where you had the same caus for conflict and thei went for a constitut dispens in which power wa basic brought down as close to the peopl as possibl now thi thi is where the basic differ is in the anc polici and our polici now come back to the point that mr niehau made now first of all could i correct a few statement he said first of all there is no such area in which there is a concentr of afrikan in which the afrikan ar the major in the discuss that we ve had with the anc we have present to them a scientif map in which there is an area of approxim 14 percent in which there is a major of afrikan now thi is the first point which i think is extrem import mashokw where is thi area groenewald thi area ha pretoria as the center with a part of the eastern transvaal a part of the western transvaal and a part of the northern orang free state now let s come back to the second point that second point wa that in thi volkstaat onli afrikan will have the vote now let me sai that thi question is still be debat and we ar still negoti with the anc and there is an accord which is present be negoti which specif address thi particular point of vote right within the volkstaat that question ha not been resolv yet mashokw mr niehau you want to respond quickli niehau well first of all the question of vote right is not resolv becaus there is a continu and an insist from the volksfront that thei want to give special right to what thei call the afrikan group who thei want to see as exclus in control of that area but secondli nowher in south africa i repeat again is there an area where afrikan ar in the major of cours you can go and take a small littl area in pretoria where becaus of the group area act there mai be a major of white live there but that area is an integr part of an econom system and pretoria is integr with mamelodi with atteridgevil and all the area surround it it s an impract suggest except if gen groenewald is sai that those area such as mamelodi and atteridgevil should be us in the old racist and apartheid system as satellit to the pretoria area where thei will be abl to monopol the econom power and make us of peopl who come in on the basi of migrant labor move in and out to work there and not be abl to deal in the rich and in the economi of that area mashokw let s get gen groenewald to explain hi posit with regard to the area the black area around pretoria for instanc becaus you mention pretoria particularli groenewald now i can give you exampl in the unit state for exampl mashokw interrupt let s look at pretoria groenewald okai but let me give you an exampl of what is accept in the rest of the world in the unit state thei have demarc certain constitu on in particular which is a hundr mile in length and at on place a hundr yard wide specif to draw in an area in which the negro have a major so that thei could have more negro seat in the senat in belgium thei have drawn mashokw interrupt let s look at pretoria i am worri about time groenewald now what i m sai is we should also look at how these problem ar solv in the rest of the world and we find in belgium in particular the boundari have been drawn veri strictli along languag line now whether you draw the boundari in such a wai that pretoria is in the volkstaat and for exampl mamelodi and atteridgevil is outsid that doe not realli matter what matter is what happen to the industri area in the area in which the wealth is creat in those area where peopl work and where the job ar on which side of the border mashokw interrupt it doesn t answer the question on what do you do with the peopl around there do thei becom part and parcel of the volkstaat of the pretoria volkstaat as it were or ar thei migrant labor as it wa the case in the past groenewald no there s no reason whatsoev why thei should be migrant labor mashokw dormitori township groenewald ye there is no reason whatsoev mashokw what do thei do do thei then have their own littl black volkstaat outsid of pretoria groenewald if thei want it thi is the advantag if thei want it now the point let me just explain thi to you we ar not talk of a south africa which is econom complet segreg we ar talk about an area in which econom we ar still integr as we ar in south africa todai there s no reason why we cannot do that mashokw let me get carl to respond and react quickli to thi niehau lesli we ar talk about a lappieskomb patchwork quilt as we sai in afrikaan littl piec of land torn apart but the realiti is thi kind of propos doesn t take into consider that throughout south africa through all the differ cultur group through all the languag group now no group that sai as a major thei want a volkstaat there is a small minor in the volksfront who sai thei want a volkstaat and the realiti is that in thi countri there ar polit divid that cut across all the differ languag group and all the differ cultur group i m sit here tonight i m an afrikan i don t want to be part of a volkstaat and the vast major of the afrikan don t want to be part of a volkstaat so the concept as it wa set out for some of the european nation doesn t work for south africa becaus in thi countri we have a south african nation where peopl regardless of whether thei ar afrikan zulu xhosa ar identifi themselv with particular polit ideal set out in the anc in the volksfront in the nation parti in the democrat parti all of those parti mashokw could you respond quickli groenewald that is what the negoti with the anc is about to prove substanti support and by mean of particip in the elect to also prove exactli where the boundari of such a volkstaat should be in other word what i m sai is the whole question of support and the question of boundari is a question which will be resolv in the elect on the 27 april so let s not argu about that now we ll see what happen on the 27 april as far as substanti support is concern let me also add that all the opinion poll all the meet we have had at thi stage prove beyond all doubt that 70 80 percent of afrikan in south africa want a volkstaat mashokw the on question that alwai bother peopl is that who ar the afrikan who ar the boer and who ar these peopl that seem to be confus the issu all the more tieni groenewald ye certainli but in everi nation in ani ethno cultur group you have diverg view mashokw ar you boer or ar you afrikan groenewald i m an afrikan boer and i can explain that to you but i think the point is you took a statement made by mr robert van tonder he is not a member of the volksfront and he is not a member of our parti mashokw but he is on of the afrikan on of the boer groenewald okai he is on of the boer now the point i d like to make is carl consid himself an afrikan as i certainli do now the first point i d like to make an afrikan know whether he is an afrikan or not there ar two requir first of all you must classifi yourself as someth and secondli onc you have classifi yourself to a particular group then that group must also recogn you as part of that group those ar the basic two criteria mashokw thank you carl you were go to respond to gen groenewald niehau ye it immedi link with what gen groenewald is sai who is the afrikan the afrikan is divers there is no center realli of who the afrikan is i am an afrikan gen groenewald is an afrikan but the real issu is is there anyon who tri to talk on behalf of the afrikan who put themselv so to speak at the gate of afrikanerdom and is arrog enough to sai that thei talk on behalf of afrikan there i must take issu becaus gen groenewald and the afrikan volksfront veri often sai that thei ar talk on behalf of the afrikan and i don t know on whose behalf thei ar talk thei ar definit not talk and i repeat again on behalf of the major of afrikan the markinor survei of a few week ago said exactli the opposit of what gen groenewald is sai about support for the volkstaat in fact it said that six out of everi 10 support of the afrikan volksfront is not prepar to leav their territori to leav their land and sacrific anyth for the sake of a volkstaat so it s veri weak support even amongst those group who identifi themselv mashokw okai carl let me get gen groenewald here to explain to me exactli what is go to happen then to the peopl who happen to be in those area that ar design as the volkstaat groenewald let me sai first of all that we don t expect anyon to leav ani part of south africa and to move to the volkstaat the idea of a volkstaat mashokw interrupt what about peopl who ar in the volkstaat in the area that you design as a volkstaat groenewald exactli the same thing we do not expect mass movement of peopl thi is not what the intent of the volkstaat is what we ar sai is that we d like a center somewher where we as a peopl can surviv where our cultur can grow where we have the polit power to determin our own futur it s a matter of paus we have been talk about the volkstaat all the time but the critic question is the on of self determin it s a matter of be in the posit where you determin as a peopl you determin your own futur now thi doe not mean that in south africa we ar look at mass movement of peopl thi is certainli not the intent niehau there ar two question the first on is if there is not go to be mass movement of peopl out of the volkstaat will everi person who live in that volkstaat have exactli the same right as everi afrikan will thei vote there will thei be abl if thei ar the major when thei have a polit parti to take over the govern of that area that s the first question and the second question in addit to that is ar we actual sai to each other that it is possibl to talk about self determin without a geograph area becaus the anc sai we believ it is we believ we can address the center of concern that gen groenewald is talk about without grant a particular independ geograph area and that is can i just emphas that is exactli the crux of the question that we have been debat and what that memorandum that gen groenewald is refer to is try to address groenewald let me answer that question quickli by sai no peopl ha ever in the histori of mankind surviv without have their own geograph area that is the first and a vital question so geograph area is veri much a part of the surviv of ani peopl secondli as far as citizenship is concern and as far as civil right is concern and as far as vote right is concern whatev system we eventu negoti in the volkstaat will have to conform to intern accept standard mashokw so you will not discrimin against peopl who ar not afrikan groenewald no no certainli not niehau so there will be the chanc for the black major in that area to take control and to rule that area togeth with a unit south africa groenewald i m not sai that niehau that s the crux of the question groenewald no that s not the crux of the question the question is we have a south africa and a south africa which belong to everyon now what we ar now sai is let us in thi south africa find a place for everyon of the differ ethno cultur group that s the first and vital question so we don t want a situat mashokw is there such a place groenewald ye there is such a place i have indic thi to you but you see what you ve done is you have concentr so far on the volkstaat you ve concentr on the question of self determin but we should start look at the altern we should start look at the anc altern becaus what we have done so far is we have limit thi discuss mashokw interrupt okai what problem do you have with that on groenewald okai now let me tell you what the basic problem is and thi is the crux of the polit problem in south africa is the fact that the anc want to concentr all the power at the center so all polit power must be at the center and in the present constitut and certainli accord to the viewpoint of peopl like mr joe slovo and peopl that we have negoti with that there is not singl not on singl critic function that ha been devolv to provinc or to the differ state not on there is no exclus power whatsoev in the provinc thi basic mean that becaus all the power is at the center and as far awai from the peopl as possibl thi is an absolut requir for the creation of a marxist state or a socialist state where you have central plan we sai no we want the power as close as possibl to the peopl in the provinc mashokw let me respond to that power to the peopl don t you believ in that niehau with respect i don t agre at all with gen groenewald that the african nation congress and the other negoti parti have not taken great care and went to great length to try and accommod the concern of the freedom allianc that is why we had anoth session of the negoti council and why a number of power were actual devolv to the region and gen groenewald know that those power as thei were set out at the last session of the negoti council actual were exactli the power that were negoti and discuss with the freedom allianc so that is not correct but secondli let us talk actual about econom polici becaus that is the crux of the matter groenewald i think we must we must first talk about thi issu of exclus power becaus a wrong statement wa made by mr niehau and we must correct that statement mashokw correct it now and we have to move on groenewald certainli we d like to move on the point i d like to make is the function negoti and pass on to provinc in the chang in the constitut were power previous that presid with local author like abattoir and it wa now pull up to the second level of govern mashokw but ar you not happi with that at least groenewald of cours becaus thei ar not exclus becaus there ar at least seven provis subject so there is not on function that ha been alloc to provinc secondli all the function of provinc can be chang by the central govern without the author of the provinc mashokw is it not a fact carl niehau lesli the fact is that those power includ the power of abattoir were exactli the on that were ask for by the volksfront and especi that the leader of the conserv parti dr ferdi hartzenberg had ask for the sad thing is that it seem that dr hartzenberg and member of the volksfront have not even known exactli what thei were ask for becaus onc we gave it to them then thei complain that thei were not get the power that thei want and we gave them exactli what wa discuss groenewald that is not true that s simpli not true mashokw gen groenewald let s look at how you ar go to address the issu of the disadvantag peopl and the fact that we had a situat where the afrikan were poor and now thei ar the econom powerhous of thi countri ar you go to address that on groenewald first of all when we look at the volkstaat as such or the propos volkstaat it onli it provid for approxim 12 percent of the gnp of the whole of south africa so it s on of the poorer area of south africa i think thi is the first and the most import point the second point i d like to make is in the volkstaat we ll have an absolut freemarket economi you cannot alwai creat wealth by take awai from the rich and give to the poor i think thi is the first point mashokw but there wa an import thing that happen in 1929 when the afrikan were poor there wa a deliber effort at empow them econom ar you go to do the same in address the demand and the wish of the black major in thi countri or ar you at all worri about that problem groenewald no of cours we ar the import thing is that everyon ha a respons toward the socioeconom uplift of those peopl who ar less advantag thi is a commit which we all have the question is how do you do it do you do it through a program by creat a socialist economi or do you do it by creat wealth through a freemarket system now our point is that if you emploi a socialist sy em there is no wai in which you ar go to get foreign invest mashokw you ar not suggest that the anc is groenewald of cours thei ar of cours thei ar niehau well that s surpris becaus the anc is not have a socialist system we sai that we have an econom plan that must creat job and we sai that we work in an integr and complex economi where those job must be creat you cannot do it in littl piec of land it must be an integr process of have the necessari public work program lai on electr to all our peopl build road run water all of those issu mashokw but then how ar you carl how then ar you go to have the state plai such an import role in creat all these job niehau well the state will plai an import role in help to direct thi process togeth with the privat sector we ar sai we will enter into a partnership where the state will help with the creation of a public work program but we will also togeth with the privat sector help with the creation of small busi and that again is an issu which cannot be address in small area it must be a nation approach of cours devolv through the nine provinc that we have and the anc sai that as the afrikan in 1929 and 1948 were try to chang around an unjust system i agre afrikan were disadvantag thei were be discrimin against so ha the major of peopl in thi countri got the right to chang that system around but not through an unjust and divid economi through an integr economi that will serv mashokw interrupt okai let s get into thi point niehau just give me a chanc i think gen groenewald ha been receiv quit a lot of time and the anc sai ye let us work togeth let us get also the expertis of the afrikan and i think the afrikan have got a lot of import expertis to ensur that job ar be creat for all our peopl but let us not isol the afrikan and sidelin them and put them in that area that onli ha 12 percent of the gross nation product and actual creat a new situat where the afrikan will be impoverish by thi plan of stand apart from the rest of south africa mashokw tieni groenewald i can assur you on thing that we will not be impoverish but i think the import thing is and thi realli is the achil heel of the anc let s leav the economi to privat enterpris and not to the state becaus thi is the basic the real basic differ between the polici of the freedom front and the polici of the anc the polici of the anc is central everyth polit control the economi everyth the state must control everi individu what we sai the state ha but on respons on prime respons and that is to see that the individu is not exploit and that the individu is safe that s basic it let s leav the economi over to industrialist to privat enterpris mashokw but gen groenewald the nationalist parti govern took the bold step of address the afrikan problem how ar you then go to address the black problem thi time of depriv peopl disadvantag peopl do you care for their vote should thei vote for you groenewald let me sai first of all as far as black peopl ar concern of cours you have to creat job but so far experi throughout the world ha prove on thing and that is that social state control of the economi ha destroi job opportun and not creat it thi is the experi of africa thi is the experi of everi marxist state throughout the whole world what we do find is those economi that have grown that have reliev the problem of poverti amongst the peopl ha been those state in which you have a privat sector mashokw you ar not answer my question on affirm action gener with due respect niehau but lesli with respect groenewald i beg your pardon mashokw you ar not respond to my question on affirm action niehau but can i just come in quickli becaus gen groenewald mashokw but let him respond to that on niehau i think he can respond but he keep on harp on social the anc is not present a socialist program we ar present a plan where the privat sector the differ trade union all the peopl of thi countri all the differ econom interest group have work togeth in the nation econom forum and also in the plan that we have develop in the reconstruct and develop program mashokw interrupt let me get gen groenewald to respond first to my question thank you carl groenewald to the whole question of affirm action mashokw ye what ar you go to do on that on groenewald let me sai that we have been busi with affirm action for a veri long time let me give you an exampl from 1970 from 1970 until 1990 there ha been a real increas in black wage of 70 percent mashokw we ar talk about the freedom front pleas groenewald no i m just indic to you that we have been busi with a whole program of affirm action for the last 20 year there ha been enorm chang now affirm action is someth which should be relat first of all to your product capac the creation of wealth in the countri through privat enterpris and job be creat certainli by privat enterpris and not by the state now thi is the first and import question so it s a veri delic measur of have a system of taxat mashokw let me hold you right there carl niehau respond quickli groenewald let me just complet it let me just complet my point mashokw let him respond niehau well you interrupt me so now can i proce mashokw pleas continu we ll come back to you niehau gener groenewald know veri well that no economi that is success in western europ and in the unit state is onli simpli a privat enterpris it is a combin of state and privat enterpris and the anc sai let us first of all acknowledg that there wa an unjust system in thi countri and that system need to be turn around and the state togeth with privat enterpris ha got a role to do it and with respect gen groenewald the nation parti who you seem to refer to as have implement some kind of program of affirm action in the past ha not done so if we look at the world bank s econom index the on categori where south africa come first is on the categori of the most divid societi and the most unequ societi in the world that ha to be address mashokw interrupt let him respond quickli carl groenewald look i m not argu about that we ar talk about the futur first of all and the point that i want to make is that in your system of taxat which is the base and which will be the base of the anc program of affirm action it s a matter of a delic balanc wherebi you can have enough fund avail for invest through privat enterpris and enough fund avail for so call affirm action mashokw carl you were still explain on thing or the other with regard to the econom polici ye the hand of the state seem to be veri strong to what extent would you then sai the privat sector is abl to maneuv and creat job niehau well the privat sector will be abl to maneuv and creat job veri well if you look at our plan we sai there ar certain sector where obvious the privat sector will have a real problem in provid for all the need like the provis of electr but we sai let us work togeth for exampl on the build of hous in a combin with the privat sector the state will help through a public work program through provid some resourc and so will we expect from the privat sector to do so and gen groenewald agre with me although he initi just spoke about free enterpris that in no state that is truli success there is onli free enterpris there is alwai thi combin and those countri like chile dure the last few year that have been truli success have work out a plan and it is a comprehens plan that includ the whole geograph area it can t be a plan that is divid by the kind of volkstaat concept that gen groenewald ha that is the plan for poverti and that is a plan for divis and eventu for a total destruct of the south african nation mashokw okai let me get gen groenewald here i ask you earlier whether you want black vote groenewald at thi stage our intent is to get a volkstaat but certainli everyon everyon who cherish the question of self determin will find in the freedom front a parti that will do everyth in their power to achiev a constitut dispens in south africa where self determin plai a central role mashokw do you want black vote groenewald we ar not go out of our wai to specif look for black vote mashokw so you ar racist groenewald no pleas don t sai that it s not a question of racism it s a question that we ar look at the self determin first of all of the afrikan peopl that s what it s all about and thi ha got noth to do with racism let s be quit clear about that mashokw okai carl niehau lesli at a time when we ar in south africa s histori where the injustic of the past must be put right where the peopl who have been oppress must be help to becom part of a full south african nation gen groenewald is sai we ar not interest in black vote we ar simpli there to continu to help to promot those who have been privileg in the past that is he said the achil heel in the past he us that concept that is the achil heel of the volksfront and unfortun thi whole even gen groenewald ha been beat around the bush and i must realli thank you for have put your finger on the real issu behind all the nice talk the volksfront still ha the fester sore of racism and the afrikan cannot afford that the afrikan cannot allow ourselv to be pull into that situat the afrikan can onli surviv lesli in a unit south africa the afrikan is strong enough to do so without geograph area we ve got a good languag we ve got a good cultur mashokw gener groenewald okai let me emphas thi onc and for all south africa is look at a constitut dispens in which we will have peac we have mani exampl in the world exampl such as switzerland which went through a period of enorm friction and violenc until thei resolv a situat in which you have good neighbor work togeth as a group we ar not racist what we ar sai is that let s move power awai from the center and let s realiz that in south africa we have differ ethno cultur group who must take hand across the tabl who must take hand across the tabl and find a wai in which thei can live togeth in such a wai thei do not destroi each other mashokw gentlemen your conclud statement niehau well lesli racism is evil it must be reject in whatev form it come even in a afrikan volksfront form what we need in south africa is an econom plan a plan for justic a plan to give free educ for the first 10 year to our children to provid proper health care that can onli be done in a unit nonraci south africa the onli organ that ha such a plan is the anc and that we will promot mashokw thank you your last statement groenewald let me sai the solut in south africa is not impos a system that ha never work in the soviet union or in other socialist countri let us look at a system in which we have a new and modern approach approach where everyon can have hi own digniti and hi own place under the sun and thi is what the freedom front propos mashokw on that note gen groenewald carl niehau thank for join us on newslin goodnight
