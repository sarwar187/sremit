todai on our program we have basic industri minist marco portal who kindli agre to join us on the thi veri dai program to whom we sai good even portal good even rodriguez after the first question which i will be ask these other report will ask question osvaldo rodriguez from juventud rebeld and who cover the basic industri sector maribel acosta from ntv and susana lee from granma newspap as everyon know minist portal s presenc respond to the problem of electr power gener i would like to ask minist portal about the current situat with the gener of electr portal i believ i should start by sai that we ar go to explain the situat with cuba s electr system object and clearli we must point out that thi is the greatest or on of the greatest problem that cuba current ha in other word it is thi situat that we ar go to explain there ar solut to our problem but there ar no miracl i want to make that clear the solut not onli involv the worker and engin of the electr industri it involv gener popul i believ it would be prudent to give our explan to the popul base on thi fact we appreci the opportun to bring thi to the peopl directli have said thi we can begin our discuss i am go to us some graph the first point we want to explain is the composit and origin of electr gener in cuba i believ thi is import for two reason our system ha 3 132 megawatt of the gener of those 3 132 megawatt 66 percent is by equip from the former soviet union and czechoslovakia 34 percent of that gener is by equip obtain from capitalist countri there ar two thing that i would like to point out the first be that 86 percent of all the machineri and plant that we have were built after the triumph of the revolut approxim 80 percent of todai s instal capac wa built in the last 25 year or less rodriguez that is 80 percent portal right in other word onli about 14 percent wa inherit from the capitalist period thi is veri import i believ thi give us a sens of secur the nation electr system is rel young strong and power in it gener capac and in the network of the nation electr system we believ that thi give us a sens of sure of overcom the special period thi is an area where i know there have been doubt and concern the fact give us thi practic inform the second point i want to make is that 66 percent of the electr gener is by equip obtain from the soviet union and czechoslovakia these two countri have ceas to exist i want to point out that in addit to the materi guarante that came from those countri favor financi condit obtain spare part and machineri etc there is a certain technolog depend it is not a true depend but a technolog depend the turbin gener boiler pump etc were obtain from those countri thi wa interrupt in the last three year and we have had to face thi situat boldli support as can be expect by the technic forc that we have from the veri begin of the revolut our industri ha been bless in that sens we have alwai had highli qualifi technician engin and worker there ar thing that we chang thought thi is the second time that our worker have had to take care of our old capitalist plant and solv million of problem thi is the second time we face thi situat but under differ condit thi time we ar face them with a greater infrastructur that is the reason i want to point thi out we can overcom that technolog depend we can do thi in two wai there can be relat with the countri that inherit the compani and factori that suppli thi equip and we can obtain materi and resourc from other countri to keep them in oper undoubtedli three year of interrupt suppli spare part and resourc is a realiti speak from an object point of view thi is what ha been happen thi is 66 percent of the gener not includ the network these ar the two element that i want to point out in thi inform i also want to mention anoth subject we would like to discuss right at the begin it ha to do with the nation s heavi crude oil thi doe not mean it is the onli crude oil the countri ha or will have in the futur thi is what we have todai and it product can be increas the import of nation crude oil in gener electr cannot be underestim especi over the past three year 1992 1993 and thi year 1994 the nation s crude oil had to be us in an immedi or urgent manner as a sourc of gener electr for the countri the countri must be awar of thi in 1989 as is well known we import 13 million ton of oil thi import wa reduc almost abruptli in 1990 we import 10 4 million ton almost three million ton less in 1991 we import 8 6 million ton and in 1992 we import onli 6 million ton thi ha been thoroughli explain by sever comrad sever time we must understand the countri s situat with that fuel cut in half in two or three year thi is the first reason for us nation crude oil in the thermoelectr plant that is thi wa not a superfici or easi decis it wa a dare and well consid decis the nation crude oil which ha a percentag of brimston probabl 6 percent or a littl more becaus of it viscos requir a tremend effort to extract handl and transport in ship or on transport ministri train etc especi for it consumpt in thermoelectr plant thi impli a tremend effort and decis by the revolut a decis adopt by us the technician the engin we made the decis to us the nation crude oil at a time when we were practic hopeless unabl to gener electr the countri need the countri wa abl to show thi last year name in juli and august the countri gener practic 70 percent of it overal electr at that time with the nation crude oil that is two or three thermoelectr plant could face the deficit situat and continu gener electr thi year 30 percent of the electr is gener with nation crude oil we hope to maintain thi it is an import amount 835 000 ton we can sai that if we were to import the fuel oil it would take approxim 60 million consid fuel oil s current price thi decis ha provid util amount to approxim 30 million or a gross 35 million todai thi monei doe not exist we do not have it consid the countri s financi situat et cetera so we feel that thi is the main caus to further explain thi phenomenon we must add that the thermoelectr plant ar not be destroi by the nation crude oil that is the turbin gener of the thermoelectr plant fuel pump system cool and automat system which ar import part amount to 70 percent of thermoelectr plant ar not be destroi by thi crude oil the ga pipelin of a thermoelectr plant suffer when the petroleum is burn when combust take place the ga goe through the ga pipe system and the corros level increas we know thi is so but measur ar be adopt to solv thi problem the shop be built to enamel the surfac through which the ga pass will be finish thi month thi will ensur that the metal will have the same lifespan as befor or perhap longer we will probabl us addit to reduc corros there is a wai of fight corros and of assimil a product if the countri todai ha thi product and if todai we us 30 percent perhap we could achiev 40 50 or 60 percent within 15 or 20 year gener our own electr with nation fuel thi is veri import we cannot make ani real project becaus we do not know the countri s capac consid the difficulti it ha to confront such as the blockad and current harrass it is import to gener part of our electr by us our own fuel a nation fuel and thi fuel is much better than coal the nation crude oil ha twice the burn capac of a ton of coal that is a ton of crude oil is equival to two ton of coal the same thing happen in the unit state and in europ when thei experienc a situat similar to our for differ reason dure the earli 1970 s when thei were forc to adapt their thermoelectr plant to consum coal in a rel short period of time a year and a half two year three year after the coal suppli had been sever some 20 year earlier we did not need to do thi we had a guarante suppli of fuel although we think thi decis wa necessari and inevit not all our thermoelectr plant ar burn nation crude oil thi should be clearli explain to the peopl of our overal capac of our 3 123 megawatt onli 40 percent of the plant ar burn nation crude oil the rent and the mariel thermoelectr plant ar essenti burn crude oil and a total of 1 000 megawatt ar produc between the two there is anoth plant in santa cruz del nort that ha on unit oper while a second is be repair a third unit is sit right on top of a petroleum deposit thi unit repres a tremend save for the countri that is part of that petroleum is consum right there it is a tremend econom factor now if you add up the number you will sai but how is it possibl that if nation petroleum can be a save factor for the countri no monei resourc or currenc have yet been obtain to invest in thi area besid we ar not talk about ten of million of dollar which dure anoth time might have been a small amount but a small amount to offset thi situat and to keep up the mainten work well these resourc simpli do not exist thi problem wa discuss last year at the nation assembl of the peopl s govern anpp it wa veri well outlin by on deputi who is a director of on of our thermoelectr plant and who discuss the financi situat veri thoroughli he correctli report that some 18 million wa necessari to try to face the mainten work i had the respons of explain to thi comrad that thi year we do not have a cent for that purpos we have difficulti with medicin and with food and that we must try to resist for at least anoth year befor talk about thermoelectr plant then by the end of the year we manag to collect some 2 million from the incom the countri is begin to receiv you know the countri is receiv some incom in dollar from certain activ well thi wa possibl and allow us to repair the thermoelectr plant unit in matanza and on unit in cienfuego we ar begin to revers the situat to increas the avail instal capac we manag to reach 36 percent when the matanza plant stop oper by the end of the year and thing have been recov gradual i will try to explain the solut we found thi year that is i will explain the measur we ar adopt and the possibl solut well hector i onli want to make thing clear concern the nation crude oil thi phenomenon is impos on nation life but we ar satisfi we ar happi that is we cannot just take the neg side of the issu of cours there ar peopl who want to see thing neg well thei might do so especi the peopl abroad who want to see our countri complet destroi but we ar not go to allow thi we ar produc electr with a fuel we did not dream of some 20 year ago or even 10 year ago for five year we have been us it to gener electr to gener 30 percent of the electr we ar consum so how can we cuban be misl by thi thi problem is go to be solv we ar go to assimil it as it wa assimil in other countri by us coal which is even more difficult imagin us coal as fuel for our thermoelectr plant imagin the dirt the handl of it the ash the tragedi that coal would caus crude oil can be assimil much more easili we have assimil it with veri littl invest name for the purchas of pump etc given the viscos of the crude oil when the time come these plant will requir mainten well thi is a subject that had to be discuss rodriguez interrupt ye thi is a subject that is discuss continu portal i think thi talk wa necessari given the prevail confus and the peopl s concern over thi problem some peopl sai that we ar destroi the thermoelectr plant etc as i have just explain some of these plant ar almost 20 year old and we ar take good care of them that is we cannot allow someth that is good for the countri to be damag thi is the manner in which we ar work but thi doe not includ all thermoelectr plant part of these plant have noth to do with thi now i would like to discuss the practic side of the nation power system sen i want to refer specif to 1989 i think it is import to go back to that year when we manag to obtain 77 7 percent of the avail capac of the entir electr gener system as well as 23 3 percent which wa kept for mainten breakdown and limit we must explain that electr is gener all 365 dai of the year and around the clock it is obviou that part of that capac will be under repair or mainten and thi requir disciplin the sen ha been conceiv thi wai there is an establish disciplin concern the thermoelectr plant for shutdown and mainten a shutdown can be short or long depend on the need there ar some unit manufactur in the 1960 s name those manufactur by the soviet union and czechoslovakia these plant will requir 90 or 120 dai to be repair the on we have in cienfuego which were made by the japanes hitachi compani requir 60 or 70 dai depend on the work that must be done the unit in matanza for instanc requir onli 27 dai well some time wa save there in short part of the plant will need time for mainten thi is what we mean by 77 7 percent of avail capac and 23 3 of mainten thi percentag wa compar to the most develop countri in the world in 1989 for instanc the yanke have 80 percent while we have 77 7 percent of the avail capac and thi ha been consolid we have achiev thi thank to our worker and technician thei have consolid thi percentag the breakdown percentag at thi moment ha reach 50 percent that is breakdown mainten failur and limit amount to a total of 50 percent the idea of limit of a thermoelectr plant ha to do with the ash the dreg the dirti et cetera which reduc the potenti capac that is from 100 megawatt it drop to 95 megawatt we keep it that wai becaus to clean a plant it must be paralyz moreov a small breakdown or a leak still allow oper for some dai but it gener capac necessarili drop thi is call limit we must also refer to the breakdown in the system such as the breakdown of a boiler pipelin a steam pipe et cetera thi will demand a shutdown becaus to repair thi damag the plant must be cool down now why ha thi gener capac been aggrav thi is the kei issu there ar four essenti caus the first caus is the suspens of the suppli of spare part by those two countri i mention befor thi suppli stop three year ago thi is an import caus and it is the truth we have manag to surviv with our reserv we did have some extra spare part in our store in the steel industri and in other invest that is thi is a problem and without ani drop in gener we kept these plant oper until the middl of last year that is we manag to resist in 1990 1991 1992 and half of last year and besid in addit to these problem we were also short of fuel but thi year we have thi fuel and so the difficulti ar be overcom despit the blackout our peopl have achiev a disciplin that is uniqu it is uniqu becaus the peopl have fulfil the famili home plan at least 90 percent of cuban famili manag to save electr a larg percentag ha fulfil the plan while a small percentag perhap 8 or 9 percent fail to fulfil thi plan not save energi more than 90 percent did fulfil it thi is unpreced not even the yanke achiev thi when thei ran out of fuel dure the carter administr when thei ran out of fuel a set of measur were adopt such as teach the women to boil water et cetera that is thei adopt veri seriou and drastic measur at that time but with the electr problem here we have surpass them with the set of measur we adopt we ar sorri that such measur had to be adopt but to return to our point thi phenomenen wa the first caus and we have overcom thi and peopl ask well why ha thi solut been found onli now no thi is not a recent solut the us of the nation oil wa not adopt overnight and the manner in which the countri had to face the shortag of spare part and materi did not emerg overnight either noth ha been improvis everyth ha been done calmli with intellig and seren we had to postpon the mainten of some plant in order to meet some demand thi is the second caus that is the mainten timet wa the second caus a thermoelectr plant such as that of matanza need to be repair and thi plant had to keep oper for a year or six month without mainten while the spare part were prepar the part were taken to the shop to be repair thi demand disciplin and thi disciplin is broken when there ar no spare part or the necessari materi the third caus which to my opinion is the most import ha to do with the countri s difficult financi situat we ar awar of the sugar industri situat that is the sugar deficit we ar awar of the nickel industri which is also experienc a drop in price and a drop in the product capac of our nickel industri it ha abruptli lost it market the socialist countri us to bui 70 percent of our nickel but in 1992 these countri did not purchas ani nickel at all thei purchas no nickel whatsoev in 1992 rodriguez and wa there a need to look for new market portal ye todai we ar sell nickel to 96 countri we must not take thi as a setback becaus depend on a singl countri for the sale of our product wa benefici correct et cetera but todai our comrad from foreign trade have manag to reach other market todai our nickel ha a market while price ar increas now we need to recov our plant we ar look for financi support to recov these plant when you lose a market and lose your client you stop have an incom and when you stop have an incom if no on grant you a loan and todai no on is grant loan to the countri the intern bank doe not grant loan the world bank doe not grant loan no on is grant loan to the countri thi is on of the few countri in the world to which no on is grant loan but thi doe not mean that we ar beg for monei we have a sugar harvest and we have nickel but i am not go to refer to the nickel issu becaus we have alreadi solv that what we were unabl to solv in the two previou year is be solv by those who invest in and trust the countri the revolut and our peopl we ar alreadi receiv capit for the nickel to solv thi problem guarante by what by the nickel our worker ar go to produc that is not the object of the word indistinct the third caus the lack of hard currenc and financ thi is solv onli by produc and by intellig seek sourc for financ and market for our product that is the third caus that i wish to explain there is a fourth caus which is the domest crude it is true that in the boiler the increas in mainten by 40 percent is caus by the us of the heavi crude oil we should not stop chang thought as i explain at the begin my explan would be object and clear not advisori these ar the four caus that have prevent us from keep thi 23 percent mainten level we have not dream nor doe the countri need to of achiev thi 23 percent but todai we cannot provid ani currenc to achiev anoth 23 percent in two year thi is not possibl but have onli 50 percent of avail capac ha creat thi situat of not be abl to meet current demand or an import part of the demand we must begin recov that capac that ha been lost we ar go to explain thi further later in sum industri ha someth we call the abc factor it ha an a a b and a c the a repres the labor forc the man hi disciplin and product the b impli ensur materi provis it financ and c repres the mainten and repair work if b fail that is the materi provis insur and the financ et cetera the repair and mainten work also fail the men repres by a have face thi i have to sai that when a man is work in a thermoelectr plant and he see a problem a leak some difficulti or a need for repair which he us to do with disciplin but now is unabl to do for lack of resourc then disciplin product and the labor forc ar affect the energi industri ha fail that is the part of it that cannot be disregard in ani industri ha fail and i am go to further explain the solut the countri ha found to revers thi situat but as i wa sai we cannot work miracl no solut will be found in 15 dai on month two month or three month no it cannot be and i have to explain thi clearli to prevent ani confus or doubt thi is veri import the peopl will rest assur when thei ar awar of the decis made rodriguez is thi a gradual recoveri portal ye it is a gradual recoveri a gradual and import recoveri and thi will be explain in the solut found now to conclud thi first topic becaus i must speak briefli about the issu of consumpt in the introduct i want to discuss the capac avail for thi year in other word from the 50 or 45 percent that we have avail for april the averag for the first quarter wa 50 percent in april we had to take a japanes unit out of servic which wa on of the most effici unit in cienfuego system i believ it would be good to explain thi it wa on of the better unit in our system a few hour befor the youth dai celebr began we were analyz the problem there had been vibrat in the turbin and problem with the boiler the repair would requir us to shut down the unit for seven dai our comrad recommend that we shut down the plant so we shut it down everytim thi happen we ar go to act accordingli the popul must understand that despit the pressur tension and numer difficulti that we mai have we will alwai have to act in that manner becaus of profession and disciplin we will not give the order to keep a unit in oper so that we later end up with greater problem that unit i wa talk about ha alreadi been restart as a matter of fact in april or mai that plant should have alreadi reach it maximum design capac that unit is alreadi about 15 year old and we ar sure it will run well dure april and mai until we complet the harvest and other activ if there ar problem and we do not shut it down we could have a difficult situat that is why in april our capac drop to 44 percent by decemb we should be at 60 percent what ar we do and what do we have to do to reach 60 percent we will have to provid mainten and repair to 1 800 megawatt of those that ar current instal thi is a high percentag almost 60 percent of all the gener plant but it can be done i brought inform with me about how the instal capac in each on of the main thermoelectr plant will behav i believ it is us it is correct thi list the contribut that each thermoelectr plant must make it is on the graph and can be explain right rodriguez ye becaus we ar also broadcast through radio rebeld portal oh okai the mariel gener plant which is current oper at 39 percent of it capac will end the year with 58 percent of it capac the plant in santa cruz which is oper at 40 percent of it capac will end the year with 80 percent of it capac with the two unit of 100 not further specifi that it current ha in oper in the solut we ar go to provid more interest inform on that gener plant havana citi the link that is gener in havana citi which is compos of talla piedra regla and frank pai is where the oldest unit ar concentr thei ar the unit of highest specif consumpt 400 gram per kilowatt the origin idea wa to keep those unit as reserv in the nation electr system todai we propos to restor their instal capac forc from the ministri of construct govern and parti leadership in havana as well as our comrad believ it possibl to restor those plant and bring the capit to 53 percent of it avail capac which is almost 136 megawatt by the end of the year we ar be conserv in give these figur thei have plan to do even more thei have even set the goal of recov anoth plant call the frank pai which is also in the capit and which ha two gener unit here we have two block import from czechoslovakia the rest ar from the capitalist era the matanza gener plant is current at 100 percent of it capac and will close the year with 100 percent here i want to paus and sai that in septemb we will close that plant to do an overhaul rodriguez for how mani dai portal thei figur it will be approxim 27 or 30 dai we mai be abl to do it in less by that time in septemb or octob we should have repair other unit to minim the effect in cienfuego we current have 92 percent and should end the year with 52 percent why becaus in decemb when the matanza plant is back in oper we must take into account the sugar harvest and the consumpt the larg unit of cienfuego will be taken offlin until the first few dai of januari what about nuevita nuevita doe not burn domest crude oil thei ar czechoslovakian unit three of 125 megawatt and three of 64 megawatt as you can see it is at 32 percent of it capac it is on of the place most affect those plant have differ problem of a technic and materi natur our goal is to bring nuevita to 50 percent by decemb there is a chanc we will be abl to do better but there ar some factor we must consid we prefer to be conserv the rent power plant in santiago de cuba is current at 33 percent of it capac and thei should end decemb with 60 percent the peopl in santiago de cuba ar sure thei will be abl to accomplish thi reach 300 megawatt as you can see we current have 1 378 megawatt and we should reach 1995 with 1 890 megawatt that is more than 500 megawatt more by the end of the year with that capac we can elimin the power outag dure the dai for exampl which affect the economi and the popul we should have a schedul of power outag that is more reason for the popul for thi purpos i am go to explain the measur be adopt and the guarante that is thi is not an explan without a basi thi explan ha a basi that i will explain when i get to explain the solut what i have to explain concern consumpt is brief but perhap it is the most difficult and most complex aspect we will need the peopl s particip for thi it is as folow thi year electr consumpt is increas it is a modest increas of close to 6 percent but an increas that began last year when gener began to drop that is thi 6 percent increas is not someth chang thought there is part of the economi be reactiv now cuban famili have consum 14 percent more electr dure thi quarter as compar to the previou year rodriguez is thi a 14 percent increas portal ye an increas of 14 percent despit the blackout and interrupt in the energi suppli thi is essenti due to the us of electr stove thi can be clearli seen at 1200 local time for instanc when gener increas by 300 megawatt more than last year and at 2000 local time gener increas by 350 megawatt there is a percentag of famili who ar veri much link to the us of liquefi ga process ga and kerosen luz brillant nationwid but todai thei ar cook on electr stove of mani type even homemad stove thi ha creat a situat that aggrav the matter i wa explain that thi is the most complex issu becaus we cannot sai that the liquefi ga or the kerosen shortag will be solv immedi becaus we cannot sai that we have the currenc necessari to solv thi problem we cannot yet sai that we have the necessari resourc the same thing can be said about the other fuel an aggrav of the fuel shortag would also aggrav our situat i must object sai and clearli explain to the peopl that thi increas in consumpt cannot be met not even by improv the thermoelectr plant or the electr network and todai we cannot ask the peopl to give up that wai of cook becaus there is no other better wai but to the extent that we can manag to restor the suppli of liquefi ga and of kerosen thi situat must be revers rodriguez then we must stop us the electr stove portal ye we must stop us electr stove thi is noth new that is the countri ha not realli foreseen thi dure thi period or dure thi centuri in the first place the countri doe not have the necessari thermoelectr plant for that that is out of two million inhabit on million ar us electr for cook and there is no thermoelectr plant that can guarante thi we must return to the past the same thing happen with the electr network in a block or a zone where you live some 10 15 or 20 percent of the famili might be us electr for cook well that transform at that pole will not resist that cabl will not resist long enough nor will the intern electr instal in home take thi increas in consumpt thi is a veri complex problem and i want to explain thi situat stem from the increas in electr consumpt we must try to recov the suppli of liquefi ga the ga that is sold on the street passag indistinct in the futur when we can make invest in the sugar mill and the situat with the special period is a bit more favor we will have to think about ga which also requir a specif infrastructur but regard electr it will be imposs for the cuban popul to us electr to cook over the next 10 to 15 year without nuclear reactor or anyth els we ar go to have no altern but to ask for the popul s cooper and disciplin in other word as we chang thought furthermor there ar all type of stove you can figur it out for yourselv there ar stove with coil that consum 1 kilowatt of electr cuba ha 2 7 million famili just 100 000 famili us these stove could consum 100 megawatt and 200 000 famili will consum 200 megawatt 300 000 famili will consum 300 megawatt that is what the matanza thermoelectr plant gener then 500 000 famili will consum 500 megawatt but there is no wai to cope with thi todai there is no wai to cope with thi you have seen that the peak demand chang thought and not seek to justifi the explan or to chang the thought i do not want to refer to other increas in energi consumpt but in the televis schedul for instanc we know that there ar illeg instal be made so if the us of televis is increas thi will also increas consumpt there ar other thing increas the consumpt of electr the most signific of all is the electr stove thi should not be it can affect other activ that ar vital to the economi the popul itself suffer becaus someon who ha thi type of stove caus an outag for three or four other famili in other word in just three or four hour the situat becom complic and on part of the popul affect anoth that is the outag get off schedul thi is a phenomenon that i want to explain rodriguez mr minist i believ the cuban popul prefer cook with ga rather than with electr i believ thei will cooper especi sinc thei prefer to cook with other type of portal interrupt ye but 70 percent of the popul cook with kerosen luzbrillant at thi point the popul cannot stop cook with kerosen when the revolut triumph half the popul wa cook with wood and coal 52 percent of the popul hector rodriguez fifti two percent portal ye thei us wood and coal the us of kerosen and ga increas and the live standard improv nevertheless thi is not the best fuel to us as you have alreadi mention ga is much better to begin discuss solut i want to explain that the electr we have chang thought it ha been repeatedli explain that electr is not store but instead is gener at the moment the popul can see that as the power plant gener electr the energi is immedi consum in the past we alwai had back up power plant gener at lower capac as soon as there were problem their capac wa increas all it took wa anywher between 1 and 10 minut it wa veri fast we do not have thi todai when a gener unit is taken offlin there is an immedi outag or interrupt that cannot be announc in advanc becaus it is practic instantan the countri and the popul suffer veri much becaus of thi and the situat will not be solv immedi becaus of the problem we have with gener capac the other thing that is veri clear is that our system is set up like other system in other part of the world it doe not take awai electr but suppli electr in other word the electr network ar to suppli we have made sever chang and small invest to isol certain servic from the normal circuit these ar hospit econom activ import for the countri the tourism industri to a certain extent and the sugar mill but here in havana citi approxim 30 percent of the famili practic never have power outag such as in habana vieja where it would be technolog imposs there ar other part of centro habana and part of vedado where it would also be imposs there ar also circuit associ with a pediatr hospit the hermano almeijeira and the calixto garcia where it is veri difficult to isol the famili what happen is that famili not on those circuit suffer longer outag in juli and august of 1993 we agre that dure time of difficulti especi here in the capit and in the rest of the provinc thei also do thi chang thought i believ i should explain that there ar sever provinc that despit last year s improv have had anywher from 12 to 16 hour of outag a dai for mani dai week month in other word what happen in the capit for 15 dai as heard is similar to the rest of the countri the rest of the countri ha been face a veri seriou situat becaus of the concentr level that exist in the capit where approxim 2 million peopl live and becaus of the problem we have been have we alwai try to priorit the capit but at thi moment at the height of the sugar harvest when not produc sugar or the plan be affect by power outag would be a hard blow to our countri we must guarante the energi need for all export activ the sugar harvest the nickel industri the tobacco harvest for which electr is us to dry the leav there have even been outag in thi area we have had to make an extra effort to prevent outag for that industri we must preserv those activ i believ the popul must agre with thi becaus we ar defend the popul and the countri when we act in thi manner it is true that not everyon ha a rel in the hospit but we cannot becom uneasi nervou or tens and take the energi awai from a pediatr hospit or anoth import hospit where there ar sick peopl or peopl have surgeri i mention thi becaus there have been incid in variou place some malici peopl believ that the electr servic will be restor through that type of pressur i can assur you of two thing first we act with profession in thi and ar convinc it is the wai we must behav when the power is interrupt in a place chang thought secondli we act with convict we ar defend thi like the major of the popul that is on thing that cannot be chang in other word the fact that on act with convict in not affect hospit water manag system or cold storag center which cannot be chang so thei can do what thei want but we chang thought our peopl must trust that we will continu to act that wai rodriguez that is fair portal do not worri about that there ar comrad who have been mistaken but with much digniti and author we ar go to continu act that wai there ar no privileg or anyth like that in relat to the outag banish the idea if there ar thing that ar consid unjust thei must be report and we will act on them in other word we do not accept that type of behavior from our comrad i want to make that veri clear well let us talk about materi guarante and their financ thi year we alreadi have financ for some 3 million in resourc which ar arriv we ar talk about steel special tube electrod electrodo and gasket part of thi is alreadi arriv apart from thi there is anoth 7 million which will be progress alloc throughout the year between the two there is 10 million destin for the gener of electr it is not someth reach 70 or 80 percent but suffici to meet what the countri ha set as an object i alreadi explain that 2 million wa provid last year and that thi year there is 10 million thi is five time more than last year but we must administ thi monei thi monei is not administ by ani bureaucrat apparatu but by the same comrad who ar conduct the mainten work and who make the decis on what must be purchas now and what must be purchas later in thi manner the countri ha thu progress a great deal that is we have improv thi part of the administr these peopl who must decid on what to bui ar peopl with experi knowledg and train second measur the prepar and implement of the mainten and repair work i alreadi explain i want to add that thi will affect practic 60 percent of the instal capac todai that is 1 800 megawatt thi is veri import becaus it will give more reliabl to the system that is if we ar todai put into oper a thermoelectr plant that experienc a breakdown in the pipelin or some kind of leak well when thi plant is repair and maintain thi plant gain more reliabl and thu there will be fewer blackout word indistinct and for thi reason i mention thi as a second measur thi graph is intend to increas the reliabl not onli a percentag of passag indistinct and the mainten worker thi mean that our govern offici have adopt an except measur concern the thermoelectr plant and the mainten shop the worker will also receiv special incent especi those who ar directli involv begin with the top engin of a thermoelectr plant that man who plai the role of a director i am refer to the top engin and all those under him i am refer to that man who is there on saturdai and on sundai that man who ha a famili and ha the same need in hi home as ani other cuban citizen that man in charg of that shift the plant oper who work saturdai and sundai in our current situat these comrad ar continu submit to a tremend workload and pressur imagin work saturdai sundai night earli morn thei also have to pick up other worker so the plant mai be work at top level to improv the situat thi is the prevail situat we have been talk to other worker to other colleagu from other ministri and everyon agre with the measur adopt in the electr area becaus we know that the harvest is be carri out under veri difficult condit by worker in the sugar industri which is our main industri we ar awar of the worker situat in thi area i am certain that those worker ar in agreement with measur adopt in the thermoelectr plant becaus thei know that worker here ar also work like them 365 dai a year i wish to add that those worker would agre with the incent to be given to the worker of the thermoelectr plant becaus thei ar awar of the difficult condit under which thei ar work these incent which will be in food et cetera will be rigor implement we alreadi have the first experi it ha to do with disciplin to achiev the incent that will be establish the worker must have zero absenc rodriguez zero absenc portal ye zero absenc and that includ tardi no tardi will be allow thi also goe for sick becaus if dure the month a comrad get sick and is taken to the hospit or is treat at home well it must be justifi but that is not enough i sai thi becaus the sick leav rate is veri high and it doe not justifi absente to achiev the incent the worker must have zero absenc the basic industri ministri ha special infirmari for those worker with some kind of problem that is we have profession and moral and a revolutionari health system we take care of ani worker who might get sick if he need help at home we go to hi hous to help him but that is as far as we can go that is thi system of give incent will be veri strict rodriguez these incent ar not for all just for the best for those who fulfil their job portal ye for the good worker well i am talk about disciplin and the other aspect i would like to mention is the fulfil of what i have just explain that is the avail factor of thermoelectr plant the fulfil of the repair and mainten work listen most of our worker ar well disciplin thei ar not worri about thi but i have to sai it becaus it must be clear to all sector that thi is an except decis and that the countri ha made thi decis togeth with the worker and it aim at obtain a result otherwis it will just be a mess and it will not be that wai if the countri and the revolut must trust someon the worker from the electr area ar the first to be trust thi second measur look more like an incent becaus the countri and societi want to recogn the role plai by the worker i think thi will yield a result yesterdai the director of the thermoelectr plant the union leader and our comrad have ratifi the condit under which thi incent will be grant we think that within the next few dai it will be implement especi dure the first dai of mai the other matter i want to discuss is that relat to the support given to the thermoelectr plant the countri s construct capac is strong and the ministri of construct is support the repair and mainten work both in santiago de cuba and in mariel as well as in nuevita that is to the extent that the resourc arriv the countri will have more possibl for face thi problem the sime steelwork industri is do the same concern the consumpt of electr both in state organ and in the home i just want to sai the follow we have to be veri strict concern product in the most effect compani thi is be done by all ministri the electr receiv must be us well all the unimport area must be elimin such as air condition these must be elimin that is consumpt must be minim dure these difficult month we must try to us it as littl as possibl now let me refer to the priorit organ the hospit the hotel some industri chang thought well there ar industri that financ their own fuel and give awai their dollar these ar not priorit industri sever of our comrad have travel abroad we have visit some countri and were abl to see what happen in hotel at dawn or in the even all light and system ar extinguish well i do not want to word indistinct the organ ar alreadi work in make a thorough control or inspect or whatev might be necessari to prevent the electr from be misus at a given time of dai we must adopt these measur now more than ever thi will be indispens over the next few month a new system is be prepar in the capit which is more complex it is a disconnect system that will be implement when a thermoelectr plant unexpectedli stop oper that is there will be a system to regul the level of electr suppli to help us regul consumpt that is if 30 percent of the overal capac is to be releas well that is what we ar go to do we ar work on thi final i also want to mention someth i consid import that there ar two thermoelectr plant under construct on in holguin specif in felton both were made by czechoslovakia but the compani that had suppli them ha fulfil it commit in previou year when we had a seriou fuel shortag that also affect the nickel plant locat in the same provinc these unit help guarante the suppli of energi and we expect to finish the first unit by the end of the year rodriguez the on in felton portal ye in felton thi unit can produc 250 megawatt in santiago de cuba the rent plant ha not been abl to stabil the gener of more than 200 megawatt dure the entir year you can thu imagin the signific of gener 250 megawatt by the end of the year in the eastern region start in la tuna more than 3 6 million cuban live in thi area that is 35 percent of our popul thi mean that electr gener in thi territori will be improv and thi will also improv the suppli of electr in the western region becaus there will be no more need to extend electr suppli toward the eastern region thi is to take place by the end of the year and is not someth that will take place right now but i want to tell you that we ar receiv resourc littl by littl the work ha not been suspend and the worker ar prepar to continu i believ thi is object inform given by the provinci govern the parti the construct ministri and the worker conting thi can realli be achiev and perhap 18 or 24 month later we will have the second unit that mean 500 megawatt that is if the overal system gener 3 000 megawatt 500 megawatt repres almost 15 percent between 12 and 15 percent there is anoth 100 megawatt unit unit number 11 of the soviet made 100 megawatt plant in the eastern part of havana there ar five 200 megawatt unit there ar three 100 megwatt and five 200 megawatt unit the five 200 megawatt unit ar no longer oper and will not be repair thei ar part of other aspir of other level of develop which we will not reach but that 100 megawatt unit is veri import as i explain befor it is sit on an oil deposit thu some 350 new megawatt will be gener by the end of the year thi is almost 12 percent thi is a unit that will also improv the countri s gener by almost 12 percent of the overal product and when the other 250 megawatt unit begin oper it will increas by anoth percentag point if we gener 500 or 600 megawatt in the east that is almost 20 percent of the overal system but thi is still under construct thi is what we want to explain in thi introduct rodriguez veri well minist let us now give the floor to our guest the report i do not know whether to begin from the left or the right i think maribel want to speak maribel acosta is from radio rebeld acosta the explan ha been veri broad and we want to get into detail accord to your explan the energi crisi we ar experienc todai is caus by the thermoelectr plant and not by the petroleum crisi you also said that the us of cuban crude oil wa rel safe that is that the mainten problem exist with or without the us of the cuban petroleum so you did not proscrib the us of the cuban oil you also mention a mainten timet which will be implement soon and that thi must lead the countri to reach a gener capac of 60 percent by the end of the year my question is thi how long or when will the current blackout be reduc after such a long time how will thi situat specif the situat of the blackout be revers portal maribel thi situat is affect the entir countri the situat in the capit todai is what the provinc have been experienc for mani month thi ha been a lengthi period the situat prevail over the past 15 dai becaus of the breakdown of the cesped thermoelectr plant which i alreadi explain and becaus of other failur here in the capit i cannot sai is except thi situat ha been affect the entir countri but here in the capit the situat is wors becaus of the situat of servic overpopul the tall build chang thought that is we ar well awar of thi situat even the water suppli wa affect at a given moment that is thi is a veri difficult situat then the gener of electr ha not been restrict to 15 hour that is it ha been improv becaus it wa drop to nine and eight hour but i want to explain thi becaus in your question you mention the fuel issu and we cannot sai that there will be no difficulti with fuel we will have difficult moment throughout the year and it is possibl that we mai have a fuel shortag we must be prepar not onli to includ the avail capac but to face ani difficulti for thi reason i wa explain the measur that will be adopt i explain in the begin that thi is not possibl i explain in the begin that we ar go to seek solut not miracl we do not think blackout will be solv in a short period of time it is not possibl not even by gener more electr or produc more fuel becaus todai we ar gener a certain amount of electr we cannot gener just overnight the same amount of electr we us to gener some three year ago the countri doe not have enough currenc to sai that the blackout will end in on two three or five month the timet of repair maribel is be fulfil that is the matanza plant wa paralyz in septemb and we ar alreadi begin to recov our capac i said that when the matanza plant stop oper gener capac wa approxim 36 percent now we have between 44 and 45 percent and it must keep increas to stabil at 50 percent by juli or august then it must keep increas to reach 60 percent do you understand thi acosta and what would thi 60 percent repres as far as the blackout portal well concern electr gener we believ that by increas gener to 60 percent by the end of the year the blackout dure the dai will be elimin that is my belief the blackout that take place at night chang thought well there must be other reason but i do not want to give you the idea that there will be no problem with fuel that everyth ha been stabil etc no the problem i have mention concern financ chang thought the nickel product and not even the sugar industri will be suffici to solv thi problem i want to remind you that we start the blackout in late 1989 and throughout 1990 that is we had to start blackout becaus it wa imposs to avoid them even by import 6 million ton of petroleum and much less with the 1 2 million ton we will have thi year we hope for a littl more rodriguez of nation crude oil portal ye nation crude oil if we did not have the nation crude maribel i could not have told you thi stori rodriguez that is if we speak in sport term we have save the game it ha save our game susana lee your turn to ask lee minist you have alreadi answer a number of question we and some listen want to ask nevertheless i want to ask you someth about electr bill with so mani blackout the bill have also been increas thi is on question on electr bill moreov in the worker parliament which were held recent mani peopl propos rais the electr rate as a wai to streamlin the economi what is the truth about thi or what ar your idea about it portal on thi issu i am forc to sai that cuba is on of the countri where peopl pai their electr bill with greater disciplin i must sai thi now that you ask me thi question about bill thi show that our peopl chang thought we have 2 5 million famili who must pai for the electr thei us and todai the famili s debt for electr is less than word indistinct thi is onli on exampl the same thing happen with the state thi is the largest organ in the countri and it ha a bill system differ from other state organ but it is a system that work now that you have ask the question i want to convei my appreci for that disciplin which ha not been lost rodriguez doe everyon pai electr bill portal ye everyon doe it is true that some bill ar collect at the hous but bill can also be paid in on of our unit at the bank or at the post offic there ar easi wai to pai these bill but the peopl chang thought well in some provinc payment have been delai but have been recov and the disciplin ha not been lost the electr rate per famili ha increas 14 percent despit the blackout it is obviou susana that when the blackout ar restor and i thank you for ask thi question becaus it give me the opportun to explain thi when we restor the electr suppli it surg into the system the refriger the televis set the light etc everyth is turn on and the disciplin which ha been excel is lost when on get us to cook with electr it is imposs to consum less electr even when there ar blackout at the time for cook when electr is in heavi demand for thi reason i think there is an increas in the electr bill and of cours the peopl worri about thi situat but part of the energi is recov despit the blackout of cours televis program ar not recov but the iron and the refriger do recov some of the energi that is part of the energi is recov thi ha been demonstr and the electr meter record it and it must be paid that must be the caus of the increas the other question is also import mani capitalist countri especi those in which the consum societi supposedli tend to increas expenditur have perform calcul and reach the conclus that thei save more or obtain more benefit from increas the util rate although thi might favor save than from build new thermoelectr plant and increas the gener capac thi is true in the unit state and other countri our rate ar fix nine cent regardless of whether consumpt is higher or lower most countri have alreadi been replac thi system gradual the greater the consumpt the higher chang thought thi is just the opposit of what prevail here after the revolut when the greater the consumpt the lower the payment thi ha been chang now what is our conclus no decis ha been made on thi neither can i talk about rate but we have analyz the follow forti two percent of the cuban popul consum up to 100 kwh of electr and thi consumpt is approxim 25 or between 25 and 30 percent of the overal energi in the residenti sphere that is almost half of the popul rodriguez it is 42 percent portal now whom doe that figur repres that figur repres low incom famili we have thi well calcul there ar the retir peopl low incom worker thi or that worker in gener etc well on propos is that the rate should be fix for that part of the popul the rate that is valid todai should be maintain and thi rate is up to nine peso monthli thi is on idea then those famili that consum between 100 and 300 kw must pai that rate up to the first 100 kw abov 100 kw thei must pai a differ rate rodriguez after 100 kw the rate should be higher portal ye if you doubl the price per kilowatt hour to 20 peso to give an exampl you ar stimul peopl not to consum over 100 kw you know that todai it is forbidden to consum over 300 kw thi is includ in the plan even though the us of electr stove and so forth complic it but we will never author a consumpt higher than 300 kw even when thi is stabil we will penal consumpt abov 300 kw and you know what the punish will be the electr will be shut off for 10 dai the first time then for 30 dai thi ha been done sever time thi ha creat disciplin thi is a preliminari idea i am give you susana rodriguez and ar you and the ministri studi thi possibl portal ye well other organ ar charg with studi how much is collect through thi channel but as we have been taught electr conserv is veri import for us not electr sale the problem is not to collect more but to prevent peopl from consum more and electr rate cannot be liber becaus in that case a person who obtain monei through sever channel will be free to consum electr thi will not be allow the plan must be maintain thi is the idea susana and it seem to be accept by most of the peopl and if some of the peopl do not agre well we will have to rais the price abov 100 kw and impos a veri strong punish rodriguez the idea is to stimul electr conserv portal that is the idea rodriguez osvaldo osvaldo rodriguez minist i want to return to the subject that most irrit peopl the blackout you answer a question on why some zone ar affect by blackout while other ar not especi those prioriti zone such as hospit hotel tourist center water pump system and refriger plant but some peopl think that blackout ar more frequent in their zone than in other and imagin that the frequenc is lower in other provinc also we have receiv call here in the studio and ar still receiv messag from our viewer state that servic is often interrupt especi at night it wa mention that revolut squar tonight wa affect by intermitt blackout the light were on and off sever time tonight peopl also ask why the ball game ar plai at night when we ar face thi situat why aren t the game shift to the daytim perhap hector rodriguez will help you answer thi question but in gener i would like you to expand a littl more on the outlook for improv of the thermoelectr plant on the outlook for blackout and whether thei save oil becaus thi is anoth point often ask by the peopl becaus as you said when the light go back on normal the refriger start work everyon turn their equip on and consumpt rise lee i would like to add someth to thi peopl have also ask about the zone not affect by blackout in municip with underground power line mani televis viewer have ask about thi those peopl fear that the line could develop problem becaus thei ar so old thei want to know what solut there mai be for the underground line hector rodriguez that is like ask me portal interrupt veri well there ar circuit that ar cut off not all circuit have the same load the same number of hous or the same econom object that is the fact the instruct given to our comrad is to try to be as fair as possibl that the blackout be as equal as possibl for all if the blackout is for six hour then it will be six hour for all and if it is for four hour then four hour for all there mai be some guidelin that ar not be fulfil dure thi period but we ar try to fulfil them as much as possibl we ar also try to maintain the best disciplin in thi area but concern the fact that we ar be unfair with thi or that circuit and that anyon can reach that conclus i have my doubt i find it veri difficult we ar control thi continu and the control is in effect we ar alwai try to control everyth especi when there ar complaint and peopl ar realli zealou about thi perhap on some circuit the blackout ar a littl bit longer an hour or half hour more becaus of the load affect that circuit sinc consumpt and gener ar simultan measur ar adopt to includ 50 megawatt more to thi or that circuit then the capit must choos the circuit and distribut power gradual if there is on circuit with a load of 25 megawatt or two circuit with 25 megawatt each or on circuit with 30 and anoth with 20 megawatt and there is anoth circuit with 10 megawatt the circuit with 10 megawatt will wait and the other will be ad to a littl more and the follow dai a littl more will be given to thi and to anoth circuit until the nation power system sai now you can add anoth load thi happen everydai that is the addit charg cannot be ad instantli it must be establish gradual so thi is not and will not be exact it is not possibl and there ar peopl who have been do thi for more than three year thi ha been approv the peopl know that when electr gener wa rather stabl which we hope to recov by the end the year there wa disciplin the disconnect hour were well establish thi wa an achiev and i am certain that thi will be restor to the extent that the condit improv now connect or disconnect is usual the consequ of the overload on the circuit thi is a fact which i tri to explain especi concern the most complic problem such as electr stove the overload on circuit etc i tri to explain thi becaus when a transform is overload there is no wai to solv it and the light is turn on and off on and off and transform cannot take thi for a long time like a switch that is just turn on and off you must have seen also that tree prune ha begun a tree branch can also caus a problem to a circuit or to a transform but thi is not the essenti thing we ar discuss todai the essenti thing we ar discuss todai is the overload on circuit that cannot handl a further increas ball game do not consum more than what 500 famili would consum ball game ar plai in a stadium you know that the program ha been chang adjust most game take place dure the dai and thi is a recreat activ veri import to our peopl for their virtu and word indistinct but concern the playoff that ar plai in the stadium hector rodriguez interrupt ye there is onli on nation stadium and the game ar plai there dure the dai portal then 2 5 million famili will have electr and perhap some 1 500 famili will be affect when thi occur well i think osvaldo that for the time be independ of the critic situat we ar face we must try to maintain that entertain which is veri import hector rodriguez it is the main nation entertain portal ye what wa your question susana lee i ask about the underground cabl portal oh ye it is true that the underground network in habana vieja and part of central havana is rather old part of the cabl have been replac but the problem here is not the cabl themselv but the system it wa a veri modern and sophist system for that time it automat regul the voltag when there is an interrupt and reestablish it through a differ channel i think it is too costli for habana vieja for the histor part of havana to have that type of electr system and we must take care of it as someth preciou in the capit what we have to do in that zone and in all prioriti zone is to demand to be veri scrupul on electr conserv yesterdai for instanc in order to make the distribut we cut off the circuit but we turn it on again especi sinc it creat problem for some refriger facil for thi reason thi zone is turn off onli in difficult and unavoid moment the system in thi zone is expect to last sever year more and it will becaus we ar take good care of it it ha not been abandon but what you said is true and we must demand a maximum save there both by the state organ and by the peopl who live there hector rodriguez doe that answer your question maribel acosta ye thank you comrad minist you have said that 10 million will be invest thi year in mainten and repair of the thermoelectr plant what doe thi figur repres in relat to the current need and also in our current relat with the former socialist bloc to what extent is our countri or our technolog capabl of guarante the technolog which you said ha reach 66 percent of the thermoelectr plant exist in the countri and ar the new invest link to these plant portal ye well we have 10 million and you might ask what is the minimum necessari for the electr system as a whole consid the 35 million we us to receiv for the electr network for transform and all the rest of the system the level wa much higher the need for the thermoelectr plant could be estim at approxim 20 million between 18 and 20 million but with 10 million we will be abl to fulfil what ha been establish as i have explain thi is an import figur negoti ar under wai with russian and czech offici to explor the possibl of obtain some resourc for these thermoelectr plant thei have listen to our request with great respons and graviti and thei ar studi the possibl of particip or econom cooper but thi cooper will be financ and we must pai for it i am not talk about ani other type of assist i am talk about econom cooper about busi we hope thi will be resolv befor the end of the year and i think it will but i do not want to confirm thi categor or to creat fals expect there ar mani peopl in these countri who regret what ha happen to relat with our countri and there is an idea wish will to reestablish commerci relat with our countri on new foundat and we of cours would never refus to do thi our peopl rephras i do not think that could have word indistinct that is possibl in mariel there is certain technolog equip such as a turbin or a gener rephras there ar thing that realli must be taken care of by the factori that plan them there ar veri specif thing that were done there there is a part of the thermoelectr plant that is univers let us sai that to do thi or that word indistinct you can substitut on piec of equip by anoth that is it is alwai possibl to obtain a part of the equip in anoth countri if that problem exist but well that possibl doe exist and i think it onli fair to sai so that is to sai it is not an imposs that our nation electr system could receiv a certain particip from do busi with thi compani of the two rephras of the countri that inherit the instal the workshop and factori that us to produc these instal hector rodriguez osvaldo osvaldo rodriguez ye mr minist the nation end up practic paralyz last year it economi it factori howev at the end of last year and the begin of thi year certain plant began oper which i suppos ha increas the demand for electr you explain i refer onc again to the chart by which you explain the repair to the mainten of the thermoelectr plant how capabl is to be recov and i would ask you could the electr system compromis the futur of our econom recoveri which certain specialist see as be immin portal i can answer that categor for you with these measur that have been taken the nation electr system it gener capac is not go to constitut a brake to develop or to exit the special period that is why osvaldito it is good to reiter when i explain that 86 percent of the capac rephras it is on of the countri with the newest electr instal i do not know whether there is ani other 25 year old whose gener capac is at 86 percent it seem to me that veri few countri can do thi and that ha been creat over these last 30 year of revolut i mean that is a fact understand osvaldo and that is veri reassur the 500 megawatt word indistinct plu the 100 equal 600 addit new on i mean in order to pull out of the special period over the next few year by the end of the centuri the nation s instal capac todai by maintain and repair and everyth that we have explain that we have alreadi begun to do and to reestablish rephras there is no doubt the electr network ar power the countri is cross from east to west with 220 volt and 110 volt line which must also receiv mainten but power substat were establish on most of the nation territori i reaffirm what i explain a while ago and the gener capac is recover later at some point in the futur we will have to build new thermoelectr plant of cours but leav sentenc unfinish i also want to tell you that the countri anticip rephras for exampl there ar the five rephras thi on here in eastern havana a thermoelectr plant which is prepar to be word indistinct the on in matanza is readi for anoth to be set up besid it we would no longer have to build a canal to suppli and drain sea water all the workshop and all that ar alreadi there felton wa plan to accommod two more unit that is to sai that we todai have just as wa done in mariel which wa plan to accommod eight unit although it began with two or four or so rephras that todai is veri import these three thermoelectr plant felton the on in havana and the on in matanza ar prepar to expand their capac without the necess for big invest in civil engin etc the machin do have to be purchas that is someth we will have to take into account in the futur if necessari it would be veri quick work to instal to expand capac as develop might requir of us hector rodriguez susana lee mr minist you were speak of oil extract you were talk about the import of the almost 900 000 ton that ar us to gener electr i think it would be a good idea for you to talk to us a littl about the prospect that exist as regard oil extract about the work be done in the search for oil about the new technolog that ar be appli to increas effici in extract that is what i would like to ask you portal i do not know whether thi might not take me off the topic a littl i would not be against answer but address moder if you author me to do so i leav sentenc unfinish hector rodriguez we have time portal will anyth be left on the other topic can we get into that hector rodriguez the matter of gener electr ha been exhaust acosta hector fundament concern that we have heard from the popul hector rodriguez i do not know whether the minist ha anyth els portal i have tri to explain without exhort with the greatest possibl object right i would like perhap to comment that the electr sector worker the sector chief technician word indistinct in gener bear an extraordinari respons on their shoulder hector rodriguez of cours portal thei have the foundat which is what ha provid i think the author the respect for what we have had to do over these past three or four year an author won by be on of the branch that for 25 year uninterruptedli grew from year to year without fail to grow for a singl year and with diminish fuel consumpt from year to year effici increas from 400 gram in 1959 to 270 through invest and so forth that is not the work of the electr sector worker alon i mean construct worker the nation the govern the revolut all work on it but that foundat wa exploit and at a level compar to that of the western countri that is import the nation s 95 percent electrif is someth spectacular we know about other countri in asia for exampl chang thought vietnam itself with whose author we have spoken is 35 percent electrifi in latin america there ar other countri rephras low countri china itself is not electrifi to the extent that we ar thei mai be at 75 or 80 percent thei have area with mani problem still rural area the countri is veri larg it is veri difficult we ourselv have 95 percent electrif i sai thi now at the end to give confid that we ar go to solv thi problem i mean thi is not a problem that will be deleg to improvis peopl peopl who rephras no we ar realli work soberli and there will be a respons by the electr industri by our worker by everyon i think that the support from the ministri of construct the comrad from the sime steelwork industri and the comrad from other forc that ar go to join in as the resourc becom avail to us is also import thi give us great confid realli that the countri will be abl to recov from thi situat we ar in the other subject is on that is veri hector rodriguez interrupt mr minist excus me befor you go into that a viewer ha just call in and is ask he seem not to be fulli satisfi even with all the explain whether the cienfuego cen the cienfuego nuclear power plant will be finish and whether thi would solv the countri s electr power problem portal all right then let us finish with the cen hector rodriguez then petroleum would be the last thing right portal ye well we halt the cen we halt it the command in chief himself as you know met with the worker there and explain the decis on of the most pain we have had to make the russian and cuban govern have confirm their will to do everyth thei possibl can to finish the cen the first and second reactor their will desir and interest both govern need a third partner to particip in the juragua cen the three countri would have to share that invest and then logic sell for hard currenc the energi gener at the juragua cen and we would have to pai those countri for it for our countri for the portion that would correspond to it the countri doe not todai have the financi mean to continu build the juragua nuclear power plant and we would have to effect a busi deal of that natur the work ha been preserv the civil engin work for the first reactor is finish it is fabul there you have the reactor and part of the equip preserv over the past two year the countri ha been inspect by the intern atom energi agenc iaea rigor inspect that have help counter propaganda campaign abroad regard cen technolog and so forth we have receiv the iaea technician their recommend were that the cen is be perfectli preserv and that a busi deal can go forward with it that the nuclear power plant can be continu if that inspect had not been posit had there been ani doubt i would not be talk about thi so i mean those ar the condit todai the russian the cuban and russian govern and the energi author of the two countri ar todai analyz thing and negoti with a number of intern firm that have express an interest in the matter that is veri interest it is a complex busi as you can well imagin difficult but it would realli allow us to finish if it is feasibl and could happen these ar veri complex negoti those ar our prospect as regard the cen we do not have right now the financi mean to continu the work ourselv alon that is clear and that is why the work wa halt and veri respons both the comrad construct worker who remain there and our comrad who ar prepar for exploit ar there and the cen could be two year awai from be finish if it were to be set up and finish it would mean 400 megawatt of nuclear gener power that is what i can tell you regard that matter acosta doe the third partner alreadi exist mr minist portal no and mayb if it did i would not be abl to tell you so at thi moment all chuckl so let s go on to the oil in the case of the oil hector rodriguez interrupt you would not be abl to tell us becaus thei not further identifi ar so alert to everi bit of busi that cuba doe to everi singl thing it might bui so as to block it immedi appli pressur immedi would that be the reason obvious portal but as regard the technolog of our nuclear power plant and all that even seriou us author alreadi acknowledg that the technolog of our cen is safe that the cen can be finish that there is no problem we have inform from veri import us govern author that have acknowledg that there is no difficulti that smooth out the wai for other partner to be abl to rephras finish the cen so let s go on to the oil hector rodriguez ye that question of susana s is still float around portal the oil here mayb we can share certain thing that could be encourag to our popul as is known we divid the island up into bloc both land and sea some 26 bloc for explor for oil and we have negoti invest by sever compani in oil explor to a certain extent thi is relat to the energi thing the nation s situat and all why do i sai thi becaus thi kind of busi deal is on of the most difficult becaus the foreign compani have to run the risk invest dure a first stage ten of million of dollar and in a second stage hundr of million of dollar that is you have to put monei into it and in on wai or anoth over 50 million have alreadi been invest by these compani in the cuban oil busi all togeth it is alreadi near 100 million in seek explor for oil these compani invest and if oil is found thei recov their invest through a part of that oil depend on how much oil there is and what qualiti is obtain if it is a big deposit and the oil is good qualiti it can be as much as 90 percent for the cuban side and 10 percent for the foreign compani dure the period of recoveri of the invest it is to be 50 50 onc the invest is recov in the first few year onc those ar past it depend on the volum and qualiti of oil found well of the seven most develop countri in the world and i can mention the unit state japan the frg as heard etc three ar invest in petroleum explor in cuba thei ar franc sever compani canada and great britain i do not think i am tell ani secret in sai that great britain is the main us alli a countri which in it parliamentari organ ha publicli studi it relat with cuba it did so in the hous of lord and it is interest to see how some british polit figur and businessmen analyz the us polici on cuba and how thei realiz that american have a doubl object with us a polit object which obvious seek to destroi the revolut by all mean and an econom object which is to prevent other countri from invest in our countri when the unit state decid to lift the blockad let us sai in 20 or 100 year chang thought or perhap if an import oil deposit is found the blockad will no longer have ani effect i hope thi will happen but it is quit interest to see how these polit figur analyz thi situat and reach the conclus that it is import to favor the trade of the former british coloni which have natur histor and econom relat with us thei have realiz that our tourist develop must be relat to the tourist develop of mani of those island that live on tourism and that thi is the moment to begin thei have taken the first step on of their compani ha alreadi sign a petroleum research contract that is there ar three as heard countri franc canada great britain and also sweden i am not talk about the us govern but about it oil compani the us businessmen from the petroleum sector and other organ such as the mine iron and steel and tourism industri area who have express concern about and ar fulli awar of our situat hope to be author to invest here thei have attend the meet we held in canada and in great britain that is in london and in calgari where our comrad submit propos and the great us compani were there thei obtain all the inform thei need and thei ar up to date concern thi situat that is thei ar will to come here but thei also have other interest but we can see and feel that there is great interest in thi area there is a search for oil todai everywher in cuba in differ stage in some part we ar us the seismic explor system which is a mandatori step thi is becaus the seismic system determin the soil structur the ag of the earth the geologi and the characterist of the place which ar best for drill if these structur ar not reveal then no drill take place that is the first step it is a guid step but million of dollar must be invest in that first step if it take place offshor a special vessel will be necessari but if it is carri out on land well equip of highli develop technolog is in us in the countri both on land and offshor thi highli sophist equip will supplement the inform and it is fair to sai thi the inform we have develop with the former soviet union for mani year the countri ha been well studi the countri ha seismic inform it ha inform on the geologi of solid miner and of petroleum and for thi reason thi studi ha been veri us and for thi reason we have made quick progress and todai we have sign contract for explor of the most promis area in the countri then at the conclus of the seismic explor step in some area it ha been determin that there ar seismic structur which ar similar to the seismic structur of other countri and which offer good drill prospect drill ha begun well the drill ha begun offshor and drill by these compani will also begin on land within the next few dai or next week if the prospect were not good we would not leav sentenc unfinish now if thi studi show that those sedimentari rock ar from the same time period as those in other countri where oil wa found and whether thei contain petroleum or not a decis will be made but cuba ha oil we hope to extract 1 2 million ton thi year and there ar good prospect to increas thi product well thi is as much as i can tell you we have taken the seismic step and the drill have begun in those place and our hope ar not just abstract our hope ar real and the prospect ar also real i also want to add that if oil is found or let us suppos that when an oil deposit is found we must then determin how much petroleum is in that deposit depend on the structur three or four well more must be drill to determin the volum of the petroleum exist in that place the exploit come later and can take two or three year depend on the deposit and it characterist but i think it would be foolish to try to conceal ani inform from the peopl on thi problem i think it would be veri encourag for the peopl to receiv ani inform of thi type and we ar never go to conceal such inform i thought therefor that it wa import to explain thi these compani have other task which will also give us an idea of how promis the petroleum busi is in cuba the fact is that us the old soviet techniqu or the old soviet well we have contract foreign compani to exploit these well for instanc a foreign compani choos a well that wa produc 30 ton 20 ton 15 or 10 ton and us more modern technolog increas the product of that well some have increas two three or four time more some have reach product of 60 70 or 80 ton and thei start with 20 ton then thi increas in oil which cuba wa never go to have wa divid and share with that compani that is the basic product is not negoti that is our but if product is increas by us modern technolog chang thought and we have been do thi over the past few year that is the petroleum activ ha thi potenti and we can enjoi it i did not want to discuss thi from the polit point of view but well thi is just a feel i have and i have to sai it becaus thi is what most cuban ar feel in thi period everi time we sign a contract of thi sort whether on oil nickel mine in gener or in the quest of preciou miner or in tourism etc with non us compani we feel a satisfact and more than a satisfact becaus we have no prejudic but an assur that in the futur we must not do thi type of busi with us compani alon thi would impli compromis our econom independ for the third time with that power countri and thi doe not seem to be what we cuban want we could not avoid it if the blockad were lift but onli in part becaus we ar not reject ani offer if the american peopl want to enjoi our beach etc we ar not go to sai do not build hotel here don t do thi or that it would be foolish on our part to refus these thing but it is good that we build our own hotel or build them with the spaniard with the italian or the canadian or with ani countri in the world well the american ar delai thi but in the futur if the blockad is lift part of the us tourist will have to go to those hotel we realiz and it is someth i wa try to convei we feel as if we were win a war of independ each time we do busi with non american capit thi is what i wa try to sai but we cannot deni the fact that the unit state that power countri that market about which no on ha ani doubt becaus it is a high level market with highli develop technolog can be attract to us as well thi feel is also share by the other compani that come here todai i want to add that we cuban ar loyal we ar loyal the cuban loyalti ha been proven we ar loyal even to our african forefath and seriou capitalist repres of the upstand compani also feel that when we do busi with on of these compani we ar never go to betrai them not even when the unit state decid to lift the blockad neither ar we go to renegoti the busi or deal we have sign hector rodriguez we ar seriou and loyal portal and thi is the rational of the electr issu to which thei refer so much you have to see what is be publish abroad how the new is distort and the treatment thei give to thi issu thei sai the countri s electr gener capac ha fallen apart do not invest in thi area anymor here is the truth about what thei ar sai for thi reason our report must try to be as object as possibl becaus it is obviou that thei ar try to thwart to discourag peopl but prestigi peopl ar arriv here continu and as soon as thei arriv at the airport thei realiz the problem we ar face especi the blackout the transport and food problem etc well peopl immedi refer to our prepar and the possibl of do busi here thei refer to our loyalti and honesti in our deal no on ha to offer 1 million to a minist or 2 million to negoti thi or that there is no corrupt in govern circl mani seriou peopl ar come here and not just becaus thei like to be here not in vain ar we in the 19th place in the world among countri where invest can be made with greater secur how mani ar behind us but i do not want to mention name i believ the press ha alreadi publish thi but thei can publish it again at ani time thei can do it todai becaus thi is someth veri import we ar on of the most promis countri for invest thi also confirm our peopl s decis to fight and to overcom all our problem thei do not want to be caught in a situat of hunger proceed from here to there no our peopl do not want thi thei ar take thi calmli and with intellig you can see that the situat stem from the electr problem is veri difficult but we ar face it and try to overcom it peopl know that thi is not go to last forev and that we ar not go to die without have had a chanc to fight and win we ar also accus of not make chang of not do thi or that when chang were made onli a few month ago thi is perceiv by the capitalist who come here we have made tremend chang in the economi a few year ago we would not even think of make these chang we have made chang in agricultur chang relat to the presenc of foreign capit and to the decrimin of the dollar these chang hurt becaus thei ar often unfair but we have made them courag we can also mention the self employ job commun with the world abroad relat with the commun of emigr et cetera these ar crucial decis and we must consid that there ar still million of decis to be made decis that ar be studi but the decis that were made ar seriou decis decis that ar veri import for the countri these decis ar not revers and the peasant and agricultur worker know thi thei know that over the past few month the state administr ha been replac by cooper thei know that there ar guarante that thei have secur and that thei can work the land as much as possibl becaus the fruit thei produc will not be taken awai from them these ar import step becaus the most common critic we hear ar that no measur have been adopt that the countri is idl that no on work thi is inadmiss for thi reason i wa sai that it is import to explain i think it is my duti to explain thi to share thi with the peopl but we cannot often share thi excus me if i am take too much of your time hector rodriguez no on the contrari we thank you minist i onli want if you wish minist to read a question pose by a listen from havana it sai how much ha the demand increas thi year at peak consumpt hour as a result of the us of electr stove portal i mention thi when i mention the 350 megawatt at peak hour but i fail to give the percentag the demand is increas 24 percent thi is a high percentag and we cannot cope with it osvaldo rodriguez minist now that you ar return to thi subject of the electr stove at the veri end of your particip in thi program allow me to ask you someth that also worri the peopl the liquefi ga and the kerosen when will their distribut be reestablish portal tremend resourc must be us to achiev thi and i cannot give you an exact date thi is not possibl to predict i could sai mai or june but there is a timet to repair the nico lopez refineri plant in mai we ar go to import a good amount of ga which is produc by the word indistinct but it is imposs to tell you that we ar go to solv thi problem in a short time i am onli ratifi what i said becaus thi is on of the most difficult complex issu we must solv within the next few month hector rodriguez the electr stove issu seem to be crucial portal ye acosta minist concern the petroleum prospect you mention is there a possibl of find light petroleum in the countri portal that is what we ar look for laugh hector rodriguez it must show up somewher portal but if heavi petroleum is found it will be welcom i think i will be forc to explain that we would us it again not to talk about cement but if it can be us in produc cement it will be of help hector rodriguez well the minist ha been with us for almost two hour i think hi explan were veri clear and broad i want to thank the minist for hi presenc here i think thi is the first time he ha particip in thi program i have been after him for a long time and he ha been sai that he would be glad to join us to talk about thi crucial electr gener issu in the countri i want to thank him for be here with us and for all the inform he ha given to the countri i think all the inform wa correct and on the mark i believ he wa consist with everyth i also wish to thank the report who particip in thi program and who have made the presenc of basic industri minist marco portal on thi program possibl thank you minist and although thi wa your first particip i hope it will not be the last portal thank you

fals hope while consist implement of the accord polici will help reactiv the economi in the medium and long term it doe not mean that the countri will have more resourc food medicin raw materi fuel electr or transport avail in the short term we must keep in mind that we ar begin a program to mend domest financ the result of which as ha been said will not be felt in the short term nor right awai it is import to note that we will be implement thi as the us govern continu to impos it cruel and ironclad blockad on us the blockad ha alreadi cost over 41 billion figur indic that the blockad last year alon depriv us of 40 percent of the hard currenc we could have accru with the exist level of product and export we will implement thi polici and the unavoid groundwork to attain our remain goal in the midst of the harsh condit which our countri face follow the abrupt loss of the market and favor price secur from the former ussr and the countri of the european socialist bloc for cuban sugar nickel citru crop and other product it is a known fact that that brutal blow diminish our import capac from 8 2 billion in 1989 to less than 2 billion in 1993 in other word we must solv the excess
