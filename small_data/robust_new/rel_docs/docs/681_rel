improv their energi resourc structur thi is the so call energi resourc effici revolut and clean energi resourc revolut current in the world s consumpt of primari energi resourc about 78 percent is petroleum natur ga coal and other miner fuel the burn of miner energi resourc is the primari caus of the continu increas in the atmospher content of co sub 2 and other greenhous gase and the format of acid rain china is third in co sub 2 discharg onli below those of the unit state and the former soviet union we discharg 23 866 million ton in 1989 10 9 percent of total world discharg china is the world s biggest coal produc and consum countri statist show that the amount of co sub 2 discharg by coal fuel in china is 85 percent of our total discharg from miner fuel and 60 percent of china s total greenhous gase there ar two primari countermeasur for reduc china s co sub 2 discharg on is a major effort to improv energi resourc util rate and conserv energi resourc the second is gradual

electr gener discharg zero on can see that us sever 5 year plan to achiev a rather substanti develop of new energi resourc util in china would plai an import role in reduc china s discharg of co sub 2

the region of china as a whole receiv 335 to 837 x 10 sup 4 kilocalori m sup 2 year in total solar irradi with a mean of 586 x 10 sup 4 kilocalori m sup 2 year look at the distribut of total solar irradi in china a vast region in tibet qinghai xinjiang southern inner mongolia shanxi northern shaanxi hebei shandong liaon western jilin central and southwestern yunnan southeastern guangdong southeastern fujian eastern and western hainan island and southwestern taiwan have veri larg total solar irradi thi is particularli true of the qinghai plateau which averag over 4 000 meter abov sea level and ha a thin and clean atmospher with good transpar a low latitud and a long sunshin time china s region with rel abund solar energi resourc with yearli sunshin time greater than 2 000 hour and total irradi greater than 586 kilocalori m sup 2 year account for more than two third of china s total area so we have excel condit for develop and util solar energi 2 rel abund wind energi resourc accord to estim by meteorolog depart china s wind energi densiti is 100 w m sup 2 and our total wind energi resourc ar about 2 530gw which includ about 253gw that could geograph and econom be develop and util in the short term thi is particularli true for the southeast coast and nearbi island inner mongolia and the gansu corridor northeast china northwest china north china the qinghai plateau and other region which have more than 4 000 hour year in which wind speed exce 3 meter second and in sever region averag wind speed can reach 6 to 7 meter second with an averag annual effect wind energi

about on half of which is us as industri raw materi feed and directli return to field with the other half be us as a household fuel china ha now creat about 4 million hectar of fuel forest ration cut and harvest of fuel forest and tree varieti that could be us to suppli firewood could provid about 110 million ton of firewood a year moreov we also have extrem substanti amount of anim wast and other biomass energi resourc howev present util mode ar veri irrat with straw and firewood equival to about 250 million ton of standard coal be burn up each year as cook fuel in low effici and low function combust mode onli 2 million ton of straw is us to make bioga equal to onli 0 4 percent of total straw output moreov the util of other technolog is practic zero on can see that there is extrem huge

geotherm resourc of tianjin fuzhou beij and other larg citi have even greater develop and util valu accord to current survei estim china ha about 321gw in geotherm resourc among them geotherm field that ar mainli basin type conduct on have the best develop and util prospect with confirm geotherm resourc of 261gw equal to 81 3 percent of our total resourc and thei ar mainli contain in the north

marin island coastlin where there area abund marin energi resourc accord to a survei of tidal resourc that conclud in 1982 we have 156 bai and 33 river mouth with total instal gener capac greater than 500 kw and china ha a develop tidal energi resourc instal gener capac of 20 980mw which could gener 58 billion kwh of electr power annual so we ar the world s richest countri in tidal energi resourc the total power of china s coastal wave energi is about 70gw and it distribut is concentr in zhejiang fujian guangdong hainan taiwan and other provinc accord to estim china ha 50 to 100gw of offshor sea current energi about on tenth to on twentieth the total amount of sea current energi in the world s larg ocean iii china ha a substanti foundat for new energi resourc util after effort through
