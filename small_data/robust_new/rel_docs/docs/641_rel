deposit in the sediment and lot of oil on the surfac said chief scientist erich gundlach of the alaska depart of environment conserv hem ad there s no question that on heavili oil shorelin especi there s obviou mortal our big interest in those case is how long doe it take to recov research ar also interest in learn whether recoveri take even longer after shorelin clean ha driven contamin sediment deeper into intertid area he said expect to die more bald eagl ar expect to die in the month ahead after the salmon run end and eagl resum prei on sea bird that mai continu to get mire in oil even if thei ar lightli oil the eagl can spot a stress bird quicker than you can spot a model t in a park lot full of cadillac when that happen he s go to go down and pick it up that s why the eagl got into troubl thi year said jim scott an anchorag veterinarian and an author on bald eagl and other bird of prei i think we re go to fight problem from thi for a long time scott said but there ar encourag sign for the oil otter that surviv the first two week of trauma the prognosi is good by the end of thi month all of the remain 25 captur otter in valdez will be return to the wild those that have been releas ar do well thei re swim realli well said randal davi of the sea world research institut in san diego who led the otter recoveri effort here that so far ha cost exxon 14 million that work out to 40 000 for each of the 350 anim pick up and treat some 922 dead otter were recov a number believ to repres a small percentag of those actual kill the otter popul in the sound is estim at between 8 000 and 10 000 earli fear have proven unfound that captur otter would be tame and when releas back to the wild would endang themselv by swim too close to human we were all concern we thought thei would be fat and lazi but thei re dive and retriev their own food thei seem to be act in everi wai like wild sea otter said terri william a research physiologist work with davi in the recoveri effort she ad that the otter some of which have been fit with radio transmitt ar avoid boat much unknown but davi like other scientist said much remain unknown there mai be long term effect oil is toxic at high concentr it is carcinogen at lower concentr he said how quickli the environ recov will depend in larg part on whether oil continu to find it wai into sediment we think that veri littl of the oil sank dure the earli part of the spill said jacquelin michel a member of the nation ocean and atmospher administr s scientif support team at valdez but she said there is a big concern that as the winter storm arriv and runoff from stream and river into princ william sound pick up thei will carri oili particl still on the shorelin into the intertid zone the area between high and low tide and to the ocean floor of greatest concern ar the bai and inlet that ar protect from the brunt of the storm becaus the contamin sediment would be less like to be dispers onc thei settl toxic compound attach to sediment could pose a long term risk to crab lobster and clam as well as pink and chum salmon which in their earli stage of develop feed off tini bottom dwell shrimp like creatur and other crustacean evid from other spill point to chromosom damag result in mutat reproduct can be damag as well petroleum compound and whole oil ar known to interfer with fish and bird egg at veri low concentr exxon plan to shut down cleanup oper sept 15 for the winter when weather and storm condit would make the effort danger leav behind a small crew to handl ani cleanup emerg the oil compani which hope alaska s fierc winter storm will scour the shorelin ha promis that it will return next year to finish the job if so direct by the coast guard but there appear to be mount scientif evid for not resum certain kind of cleanup method especi those involv the us of high pressur hose to direct stream of 140 degre water at oili shorelin shorelin steril govern scientist from the us environment protect agenc noaa and the alaska depart of environment conserv said the tactic ha steril shorelin kill microorgan the hose of all kind ha also also wash toxic oili sediment further into intertid zone upset the natur biospher it appear now after the clean occur there s a substanti chang for the wors ventur david kennedi scientif support coordin in valdez with the nation ocean and atmospher administr we re see larg plume of sediment redeposit in sub tidal below the low tide line area you can t help but have some neg impact he said noaa is an arm of the us depart of commerc the cleanup ha spawn a number of other environment problem as well the oili wast and debri that ha been collect ha itself becom a controversi exxon ha import inciner to burn the wast other wast have been ship out of state a fact that ha underscor the point that alaska ha been ill equip to deal with toxic wast controversi also continu over the us of kerosen base oil dispers known as corexit 9580 on shore to break up thick layer of oil until now the us of such dispers ha been restrict to the open ocean becaus of their toxic noaa and the state have recommend against it further us exxon us it on three site on smith island cover 25 000 squar feet of beach but the state said it thin the oil so well that it flow into the water and could not be skim while also load more toxic into the sound meanwhil there ar promis sign that natur mai succe where exxon ha fail especi if it is given a boost the epa ha endors a so call bioremedi effort in which fertil is appli to oil shorelin to speed the growth of oil eat bacteria which ar natur present the fertil of nitrogen and phosphoru help the bacteria more readili synthes the carbon found in the oil the bacteria consum 50 to 60 of the carbon and leav a rel nontox asphalt residu behind camp david dinner epa administr william k reilli is so enthus he recount a dinner recent at camp david with presid bush and quot the presid as have ask bill ar those bug eat as fast and as much as you hope thei ar instead of take upward of 10 year to rid the shorelin of the oil s most toxic compon it mai take just three to five year it look promis our scientist ar encourag reilli said the real beauti of thi is we have so much natur degrad of oil a lot of us didn t expect that prichard said the bacteria can easili get to all the nook and cranni that exxon miss prichard of the epa said that onli 17 of the oil ha been remov from shorelin by physic process there ha been a slight increas in alga after two week from the nutrient in the fertil but the increas is not signific accord to fran kremer a senior environment engin with the epa who ha been monitor test plot on sever princ william sound island becaus of the chanc of oxygen deplet alga bloom in the water the bioremedi techniqu is not permit in area where flush by current is minim there is on other drawback bioremedi is less effect on heavili oil shorelin becaus the bacteria ar activ onli on the surfac of the oil where oxygen and water ar present in a real sens the cleanup oper is write the book on how to respond to massiv spill in arctic water immedi after the spill exxon rush in scientif team to strateg point along the alaskan shorelin to grab sampl of water and marin life befor the oil arriv the inform is be us as a start point to determin the impact after the oil hit those same area up until now we ve had a fair number of spill but we ve never been abl to tool up fast enough to studi them and learn from them fortun on thi on we got out earli enough to start get some answer hem said kelp growth base on the befor and after sampl taken here hem said there is evid that the growth of kelp ha been retard by the spill but no firm conclus can be made yet he said last year s unusu sever alaskan winter mai also be a factor scientist have also learn how much oil it take to kill an otter from damag to the mammal s lung liver and other intern organ otter with hydrocarbon concentr in their blood of more than 200 part per million eventu di those with less than 200 p p m live the first two week were critic to an effect respons unless someth is in place your rescu effort is blunt davi said but it is a hard wai to learn we know it s go to occur again we saw it thi summer with three other spill william said peopl need to stai mad thei need to be remind how chaotic it wa here
