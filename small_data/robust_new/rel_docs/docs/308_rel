bodi is more clever than us research todai aim to produc implant that knit togeth with the bodi s own tissu the kei factor here accord to professor colin humphrei a biomateri specialist at cambridg univers is not so much the chemic natur of the implant as it micro structur the materi must have a shape and textur that is compat with live tissu on the scale of a few nanometr millionth of a millimetr if it doe not have the right nano structur it will not work he sai a good exampl of the new focu on micro structur is bonfield s project at queen mari and westfield colleg to design from scratch an artifici bone that will fit as well as possibl with the real thing hi team ha come up with a composit materi contain hydroxi apatit the main miner in bone blend with plastic although hydroxi apatit ha been us befor bonfield believ hi materi is the first with the same nano crystallin structur as natur bone the result when it is put next to osteoblast bone produc cell is that tini whisker of bone grow cleanli into the implant clinic test of the materi ar show that it can successfulli repair the cheekbon of peopl whose face have been disfigur by diseas or accid thirti patient have alreadi receiv the implant and 400 more ar due to take part in an extend clinic trial as with most research develop bio materi bonfield s goal is to move into hip joint the biggest sector of the

000 peopl a year worldwid whose own joint have been ruin by arthriti and other diseas the natur hip is a ball and socket joint it replac involv cut off the round head of the patient s thigh bone and hammer in a metal spike to which a new ball is attach at the same time the natur socket in the pelvi is cut out and replac with an artifici cup made from metal line with plastic both compon of the artifici joint ar convention cement in place with a glue call polymethyl methacryl total hip replac have given good result in elderli patient work well for 10 to 15 year but thei last less well in peopl under 70 who ar more activ and put more strain on their hip their new joint can fail within five year usual becaus the bone shrink awai from the implant which then work loos the result is that a
