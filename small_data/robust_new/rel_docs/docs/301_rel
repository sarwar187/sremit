that the attornei gener s offic wa not satisfi with the process of drug traffick surrend to justic and also that you would withdraw from the process if your suggest were not heed do you continu to think thi wai why arrieta i did not sai i am dissatisfi with the process quit the contrari i said it should be carri out but within certain legal and polit paramet on of them is necessarili the exist of a confess fortun thi is what ha happen and todai the attornei gener s offic the offic of the prosecutor gener of the republ and the govern of the republ fulli agre on thi point which ha also been accept by those who ar to surrend regard the second point the attornei gener s offic cannot withdraw from the process becaus it particip is determin by the law howev we ar think about the possibl of have somebodi who is not the attornei gener the deputi attornei gener attend the preparatori meet becaus it is not desir to deplet our reserv in thi type of situat el tiempo the govern hint that the prosecutor gener is be naiv in thi process and that the traffick ar try to take advantag of thi situat do you think thi is so arrieta i don t think the prosecutor is act naiv i believ he ha taken an emin jurid posit as correspond to an organ that is part of the judici branch in thi context it is inevit that the drug traffick who have excel legal advis try to obtain all the benefit and take advantag of the loophol and confus in a crimin law that is confus profus and wordi confront with such a situat we all have the respons of try to avoid abus to or the improp us of the law the govern ha vast experi on thi issu the experi is base both on the accomplish and the failur of the surrend polici furthermor it handl as correspond to a govern a polit dimens that caus it to be extrem cautiou and sometim bias that is why it is necessari for us without be naiv or radic to join our knowledg and experi in other word let us forget the la catedr syndrom refer to the scandal prompt by the late drug lord pablo escobar s escap from la catedr maximum secur prison in envigado we have to learn from the past and move forward with respons and without fear el tiempo you also told el tiempo a month ago that the drug traffick had made no concret offer doe thi still hold true what exactli ha gilberto rodriguez orejuela offer arrieta it is import that the countri s expect regard thi process be lower a few month ago we were told there would be massiv surrend and that drug export would be erad thi natur gener great hope both for the public as well as for the govern unfortun the cali gentlemen chang their posit and todai onli talk about the possibl surrend of two person on of them rel minor but the other on gilberto rodriguez of great import becaus of hi hierarchi in the so call cali cartel there is no longer talk about the erad of drug traffick but rather of a possibl cooper that could lead to new surrend or to the gradual reduct of illeg activ all thi is import natur but doe not have the polit or jurid relev that the origin offer had that is why we should no longer talk about the cali cartel s surrend but about the possibl surrend of gilberto rodriguez that is why i believ we have to lower expect el tiempo the discrep between the prosecutor gener and the govern ar obviou what is behind their posit will thi situat obstruct the process arrieta discrep of form and substanc among the three institut involv ar inevit in a process such as thi becaus the person in charg of the govern the prosecutor s offic and the attornei gener s offic ar autonom and will and sometim thei have differ opinion about what best suit the countri what is import is that we as respons and sensibl peopl do everyth possibl to reconcil our posit and to work harmoni becaus thi is what suit colombia if thi is not produc then each on will have to perform hi legal and constitut function accord to hi belief of what is best el tiempo the north american have demand a common posit and thi doe not exist what will happen to the suppli of evid what will happen if thei withdraw from the process there is the impress that thei ar pressur for hardlin solut and that thei prefer captur to surrend becaus thei do not like the penalti too light that would be impos in the case of surrend what can you tell us about thi arrieta unfortun a tens atmospher in the field of legal cooper ha emerg and we have to overcom it becaus us cooper is of fundament import but regardless of how import thi cooper might be it cannot be the soul of our polici nor can we depend entir on it becaus legal cooper cannot replac

on the issu of confess indulg becaus of collabor and hous arrest arrieta my offic ha alwai maintain that confess must be a necessari requir and not just ani confess but solid seriou and complet confess in which the peopl and the court author mai believ and as a basi for which sentenc can be appli so that thei do not engend impun or demor the peopl we have also insist that collabor must be signific specif and percept that there must be a substanti deliveri of asset and that hous arrest would appli onli in except case in minor case el tiempo it is evid that while the prosecutor gener want the process to move on quickli the govern want to includ element that take into consider nation and intern interest that would make the process move slower how do you think the process should go arrieta thi process ha legal and polit aspect speak in the broadest sens on should not rush becaus we have learn from experi that if thing ar rush then error ar made i also believ though that we all want the process to move as quickli as reason possibl i think that the prosecutor gener s offic now understand the govern s concern and that the govern now understand the problem of the prosecutor and all of us know now that thi process can move forward onli if an interinstitut effort is made and there is teamwork el tiempo the role of mediat between the govern and the prosecutor gener s offic ha caus an ambival situat in which the govern accus you of be the uncondit alli of the prosecutor in addit the prosecutor gener s offic argu that your stand is a reflect of that of the govern where do you stand on thi arrieta ye that is all true and if the attornei gener s offic ha tri to mediat it is not onli becaus we believ that posit is on of our duti but becaus we also believ public skirmish weaken institut and undermin the credibl and the trust peopl have in those institut we must not forget that onli crimin fish in these troubl water el tiempo regard the surrend of the three presum cali cartel member in januari is your predict come true that the ambigu of some articl of the new penal code might creat condit that favor impun in some particular case arrieta i believ so becaus mani of the articl were poorli draft have a confus content and scope and lend themselv to mani interpret for the sake of prevent impun it is necessari that we wed our capabl and effort act in a coordin manner and have the abil to stop ani goal thei will undoubtedli try to score but abov all crimin can onli be sentenc when proof is avail el tiempo relat to the current controversi what do you think about the remark by the justic minist on the prosecutor gener s offic interpret of articl 369e s scope arrieta the attornei gener s offic respect but doe not complet agre with the justic minist s interpret of articl 369e nor with the implement the prosecutor ha given it by open a formal investig on these proceed it is obviou at least to us that articl 369e is relat to the preced articl that concern the

an investig for the prosecutor gener s offic who gain admitt to la picota in order to write a report on condit in the block it wa also discov that the offici from the prosecutor gener s offic had been

visit to roberto escobar when he wa a patient at the militari hospit after the letter bomb incid final the secur council took up the matter of prosecutor cruz helena aguilar s meet with carlo mario alzat urquijo lui carlo aguilar gustavo adolfo gutierrez and jose fernando posada it becam evid that it wa no mere legal proceed but a meet between a repres of the cali cartel name lui guillermo angel restrepo and the medellin peopl aim at clear up the death of antioquia governor antonio roldan betancur what the futur hold there ar those who thought that julio fabio urdinola s present on saturdai would be follow by a truce in the war between the govern and the prosecutor gener s offic howev earli statement by the prosecutor gener and the presid made it quit clear that such would not be the case de greiff hasten to sai he hope that what had happen would end the govern s hysteria while gaviria said urdinola s surrend wa a veri good thing to consolid the polici of surrend but that it would in no wai fix thing with the prosecutor gener whatev the case the countri can learn sever lesson from what ha happen the first of these is that these thing occur when legisl is draft that give rise to ambigu as wa the case last year with the code of crimin procedur a matter on which both the prosecutor gener s offic and the govern were in agreement ambigu legisl give rise to interpret as contradictori as those now made by both the execut branch and the prosecutor gener on standard to be appli in the case of the surrend of the cali cartel the second great lesson is that in a countri that ha suffer from drug traffick for so mani year cooper between govern and legal author is not onli desir but absolut necessari howev much the prosecutor gener mai claim that the agenc under hi tutelag is autonom and that colombia ha a separ of power articl 113 of the 1991 constitut state that the differ organ of govern have separ function but will cooper harmoni to achiev their goal if thi must be so in ani on field it is in the fight against drug traffick where victori have been obtain onli when the differ organ of govern have work shoulder to shoulder that is why in addit to be indispens cooper between the govern and the prosecutor gener s offic is vital two entiti detach from the govern the polic and da must do the work of secur and intellig and the prosecutor gener s offic must us that inform and make it judici us through inpec which fall under the ministri of justic the govern must guarante that those arrest and convict must go to prison other agenc of govern ar involv in the process howev the arm forc as a whole in the seizur of shipment the fac colombian air forc and aerocivil with respect to plane us in traffick and the superintend of bank and exchang with respect to drug traffick monei launder for all of these reason entrench such as that of gustavo de greiff with respect to the autonomi of the prosecutor gener s offic can be valid from the legal standpoint but mistaken in practic someth similar can be said about cooper with the govern of the unit state howev much it mai displeas mani nationalist colombian washington is colombia s main partner in the fight against drug and to break with that countri can be as costli as do so in the commerci or polit field whatev the case as confirm by statement made follow urdinola s surrend the confront ha appar reach the point of no return it is too earli to sai which of the two camp is ahead in the public opinion poll the prosecutor gener s offic ha lost much of the prestig it enjoi sever month ago as shown by recent poll even so howev de greiff continu to enjoi great credibl if he doe not want to lose it he will have to demonstr that the busi he propos with the peopl of cali is not onli good for that citi but right for societi the prosecutor gener s offic will have to compil proof and reconstruct solid case against those newli surrend if it doe not do so not onli will the prosecutor gener and hi offic lose respect but the greatest judici reform of contemporari colombia establish of the accusatori system will be on the verg of collaps

the import stage of russia s transform into a democrat state is now come to a close a democrat system of power is be shape on the basi of the constitut the institut of the presid whose power ar design

after all a program without resourc back is simpli a slogan the initi version wa a wish list it cost 16 trillion rubl r which wa clearli unrealist it wa necessari to lower our sight the second version

FBIS3-15988: languag lithuanian articl type bfn articl by broniu genz legisl deputi and member of the lithuanian democrat labor parti the negat of the state excerpt the overal destruct of the state is go on in lithuania the press is wage an intens propaganda war against all govern structur without except the seima parliament the presid court and self govern it seem that no posit chang have occur sinc the restor of independ in lithuania thi idea is be promot on all level from the 16 februari independ dai to the leftist opposit refer to right and left radic forc the reader is be persuad that lithuanian ar immatur for their statehood thei vote for god know who most of them support those who do not deserv support and so on the suprem evil is the seima formerli the suprem council which is compos of foolish and avid deputi monei assign for it mainten is wast it follow from these specul that elect ar an unnecessari wast of financ and that lithuania doe not need elect bodi wa it better when stranger rule us might the nation need a leader like the on landsbergi offer at the 23 mai 1992 referendum sinc citizen did not grant him unlimit power should not thei put him in thi post in some other wai i am convinc that some of these propagandist do not even consid what thei ar propos to the nation anoth target of critic is the nation defens system is everyth so black there as well a campaign is be wage against the nation defens ministri kam and the volunt nation defens servic skat some peopl have a great temptat to bring the first organ of our militari structur to the bar paper ar publish an increas number of articl expos our armi everyth is bad there the armi is arbitrari and corrupt we must understand howev why we have such a situat and look for wai of improv it i would like to ask the current kam critic where were you earlier and what wa your role in creat militari structur could our arm forc albeit imperfect emerg on anoth basi when our countri had no intern recognit no state could legal support us with arm if some countri had tri to do thi openli it would have been condemn for interfer in intern affair the illeg arm trade is a dirti busi it is often link with the crimin world histori doe not know ani group fight for it countri s independ which ha not tri to acquir arm illeg while there is no legal wai therefor crimin charg can alwai be brought against them later for the illeg acquisit of arm passag omit while lithuania wa not internation recogn it wa danger to work in it militari structur particularli without arm there were no possibl then to check everi person come to the defens system and find out where he or she had bought their arm crimin usual take advantag of such situat the suprem council secur depart the skat and the nation defens depart later the kam emerg dure the event of januari 1991 there is no wonder that ordinari hooligan and thiev also found themselv there due to the lack of control i am sure that the russian secret servic inspir mani of them to join these structur these servic must have infiltr their agent into our origin militari structur i think that these peopl have not disappear unfortun we know littl about their network howev thi is onli on side of the moon what about the other kam and skat politician of that time would impart hatr toward their own countrymen with differ view rather than foreign invad thei seem to see enemi around everi corner i think that the futur will expos those who spread hatr and their goal on the other hand our militari command did not allow themselv to be involv in polit intrigu thei accept the result of both the 23 mai 1992 referendum and the octob seima elect even though some peopl want to annul them the staff of kam skat and the suprem council secur depart behav properli dure those elect polit toler and respons wa come into be power wa be smoothli transfer from on polit group to anoth our militari command did everyth to prevent georgian type develop in our countri passag omit certainli we must protect our militari structur from further corrupt howev financi violat in the past and the present ar two differ thing if we continu to bluntli attack the kam we will either set the armi against us or impart an inferior complex to our soldier which would be ruinou to the state in either case summar these observ on can draw the conclus that there ar two group of peopl interest in discredit kam and skat 1 those who fail to us militari structur for their egoist interest 2 the enemi of our independ who would like lithuania not to have even a symbol forc that could resist attempt to suppress our state let us consid the follow synchron event as soon as the extern pressur increas the intern opposit from the pole union to the nationalist parti becom activ both these organ ar extrem nationalist it would be understand if thei engag in cultur issu i do not think that these small organ could rais a big commot all by themselv for exampl the vilniu region council guid by the pole union is step up pressur on lithuanian school such step ar noth but provoc there ar mani former enemi of lithuania s independ in thi union therefor it is clear why lithuanian citizen look upon thi organ with suspicion at the same time the nationalist ar shout about new elect the overthrow of the govern and so on thi forc on to consid which group ar interest in lithuania s unstabl situat and bring on to the conclus that there ar three such forc oper in our countri the first forc is the support of the restor of the russian empir thei want to discredit the veri idea of lithuania s statehood and persuad the world commun as well as the lithuanian themselv that lithuania is immatur for it independ therefor thei ar dissemin the follow idea abroad former communist have return to power chao poverti and theft reign the countri it is danger for foreign to stai here longer there is no order in the countri or that lithuania is capabl of export onli cheap prostitut to the west thu there remain noth els but to return to the embrac of the russian empir the second forc is the construct opposit it singl goal is to return to power by ani mean without know what to do after that although thi group is try to discredit lithuania s current govern alon actual it contribut to ruin not onli govern institut but also the state itself the third forc is the mafia which is complet it integr with the intern crimin world mafia structur do not care about the color of the govern thei seek to creat corrupt author incap of control the countri s economi the syndrom of a banana republ in realiti even though thei do not seek thi subject the latter two group serv the first on i am sure that the first forc ha a network of it agent in the second two and it can control the latter s

FBIS3-32619: languag spanish articl type bfn new confer by colombian presid cesar gaviria with unidentifi moder and domest report at narino presidenti palac in santa fe de bogota broadcast in progress live text gaviria that allow militari member of other countri to undertak joint exercis with the colombian militari in the implement of old practic that ar back by intern agreement unfortun in respons to a well found legal document that i sent to that judici bodi some dai ago with the utmost respect a press communiqu wa releas that lack legal argument i learn of the communiqu through the media not through proper channel as if it were more import to gener a particular climat of public opinion than to strictli carri out a legal procedur thi attitud contrast with the on i assum with the state council to which i gave detail and confidenti explan awar of the implic that thi debat ha for our countri in the nation and intern arena i receiv the new with the peac of mind of know that these type of oper ar necessari us and opportun for colombia as well as with the confid that the legal argument that the state council reject ar solid and that the decis that were made do not violat the constitut which under the leadership of thi administr embodi the great chang that colombian societi had demand for year for it polit organ i continu to believ that we had to strengthen the institut that exert control and give congress the mean to exercis it oversight function of the action of the execut branch that is why we will be readi to provid congress the bodi to which the state council decid to remit the issu with the explan that it consid relev with the assur that thei will not be reject with the stroke of a pen but analyz strictli and calmli from what is infer from the brief statement of the judici institut it seem that the state council ha given a constitut provis a scope that it obvious doe not have thei ar try to claim that the duti of request senat or state council permiss for foreign troop to temporarili enter our countri mean that it is necessari to request such permiss for ani foreign militari man to enter colombia regardless of the purpos of hi visit such an interpret ha led to the absurd of assert that to allow the entri of the militari attach which dozen of countri have in colombia just as we have in as mani countri would requir that permiss or that a joint intellig oper to pursu a crimin would requir the prior meet and pronounc of the senat it would also mean that valid intern agreement with long stand tradit such as the inter american treati of reciproc assist and the 1952 militari assist agreement have somehow magic lost their effect and that colombia should therefor fail to fulfil all their claus it is clear that thi is not the spirit of thi constitut nor of the constitut that have govern us sinc 1821 which have invari establish a similar polici what the polit constitut seek is to establish a procedur for grant permiss for the transit or station of foreign troop that have warlik object against a third countri it doe not in ani wai seek to regul joint train oper the oper of advanc technolog equip the mainten of equip or technic assist all of which ar part of valid intern treati if thi issu of such import had been studi veri carefulli it would not have been difficult to conclud that thi norm wa establish for situat in which foreign armi ar confront other nation a situat in which the nation s neutral would be compromis and which would obvious demand a pronounc from the senat which is also empow to declar war the state council should rememb that the drafter of the constitut of 1886 had in mind the isthmu of panama which we then held which explain the refer to the dock of foreign war vessel sinc 1926 the state council ha veri clearli identifi the case in which prior author by that bodi wa unnecessari these statement should still be complet valid the state council ha said that act befit brotherhood and intern courtesi and all those the constitut endow on the presid as the suprem administr author do not compel the govern to consult the state council can a judici bodi sai that we ar respons for certain thing becaus we abid by previou rule about 17 month ago dai after the escap of escobar in respons to a concern publicli voic by the then state council presid i forward to that bodi a statement where i made the same argument i am reiter now at that time the state council the same state council that todai is chang colombia s tradit legal interpret of thi matter did not refut the argument in my letter but seem instead to agre with and accept them we ar face an unusu cirucumst where the presid is be held respons not for make a decis but for share and support the legal reason on which it wa base and that the state council had tradition accept the state council s statement is not a legal decis it simpli appris congress of it action and i must point out the govern ha provid all the document and the judici branch ha onli said it doe not find the state council statement convinc the consequ of thi decis is no other than the acknowledg by the selfsam state council that it lack the author to review the alleg violat of the constitut and order the appropri sanction all of which fall within the purview of the congress the state council s statement is not legal but polit the vagu of the statement of that bodi and even the fact that it presid is argu over the radio that colombian artisan can build a littl school do not constitu a legal argument worthi of respons until a compet organ make a decis we will continu to pursu intern cooper and ani joint exercis the govern mai consid essenti to improv the train of our militari forc thi cooper which is most advis for the countri is base on intern treati ratifi by the congress these exercis mere constitut the implement of these treati and not a de facto situat cooper in intellig advisori servic and mainten is vital in the struggl against crimin drug traffick organ the radic interpret express in the state council s press statement mai benefit drug traffick and will undoubtedli weaken our capabl to deal with crime colombian i understand there mai be those who disagre with the joint exercis conduct along colombia s pacif coast i cannot ignor a shallow legal interpret that mai make us renounc oper that ar indispens to defend ourselv from crime and drug traffick as a matter of fact the govern ha admit there have been flaw in keep the public inform perhap thi ha prompt differ peopl from speak out against militari cooper with the unit state i am certain that onc peopl hear my explan todai that mani will chang their opinion we have conduct differ joint action with the us govern to improv and increas the effici of our polic oper we have receiv technolog in the form of radar equip that is direct and oper by colombian and for which us personnel provid us with advic and mainten we have conduct joint engin exercis for the construct of variou project almost 100 colombian soldier ar current in the unit state particip in oper similar to those that have come under fire in colombia and it ha never even cross anyon s mind that those soldier might pose a threat to the sovereignti of the unit state in all thi debat there ar at least two contradict the first is the belief that these effort to improv the colombian public forc s train and effici constitut a violat of our sovereignti when in realiti these effort ar aim at guarante our sovereignti sovereignti is much more at risk with a nation in the hand of crimin and drug traffick with a nation lack the capac to react to crimin activ with a state baffl in the face of thousand of clandestin flight by foreign and local aircraft that ar traffick drug than with a state apparatu that appeal to intern cooper to guarante the rule of law and the legitim exercis of the right of it citizen it is also surpris that we demand the intern commun s support for the colombian peopl s brave struggl against the major drug traffick organ and now we ar sai that thi support is a threat to our sovereignti as someon said some time ago intern cooper is not a few pat on the back it is among other thing train and logist support sovereignti is not a rhetor concept that is defend with speech on the public squar dure elector campaign or by simpli rant anti american chauvinist statement base on opportunist nation or popul our independ in the sphere of intern relat is open to everyon s scrutini let everyon see how we have conduct ourselv at the variou intern forum how our repres have vote at the unit nation oa and other multilater organ how we have plai an activ role in the nonalign movement and the group of 77 how we have resum relat with cuba in short let everyon see the daili perman dynam that ha place colombia in a posit of leadership in latin america citizen sovereignti is defend when on brave confront the fatherland s enemi when on confront those who threaten the peopl s secur and take advantag of and violat our territori river sea and airspac to conduct crimin activ sovereignti is not an abstract valu a simpl dead letter in the law or constitut we ar more sovereign when we ar abl to exercis greater control we ar more sovereign when we strengthen the colombian arm forc capabl to do their duti of defend the countri s secur and integr we ar more sovereign when we acquir alli that support us in our battl against stateless individu who murder our women and children word indistinct thi constitut the defens of our sovereignti those who wrap themselv in the colombian flag and tear their hair over the alleg violat of our sovereignti becaus we allow technician and militari engin from other countri into colombia ar mistaken our enemi ar power to defeat them it is not enough for us to emploi technolog abil or sacrific we need solidar and support what would have happen to europ if it leader had not had the vision to form an allianc to combat the specter of hitler what would have happen to colombia if we had relinquish intern cooper in our battl against the then self style medellin cartel would we perhap be freer more sovereign or more independ live under the tyranni of escobar s narcoterror would we be freer more sovereign or more independ by let crimin from all countri and of all ilk violat our airspac would we be freer and more independ by let drug traffick have everi technolog advanc at their dispos while we take shelter in our modest technic capabl renounc intern aid until 7 august when my mandat end i will continu my effort to expand our democraci modern our countri diminish poverti and injustic and face without hesit those who sow destabil and fear until we prevail over them fear of debat will not make me hesit to make or support decis such as the on be discuss within the framework of the constitut which thi govern know well whenev i feel it is for the good of the republ or to fight crime purpos which the major of colombian share who prefer to open themselv to the futur and not cling to the past thank you first unidentifi report in progress the exercis of us servicemen with colombian servicemen the

establish the legal anteced for the constitut norm the anteced alwai refer to the time when militari troop pass through colombia and when panama wa part of colombia thei mention belliger troop that ar particip in a war against anoth countri or go to anoth countri thi ha noth to do with militari cooper activ all countri accept and want such cooper we have been develop thi militari cooper for the past 50 year we have had militari personnel from the unit state and other countri come to our countri for the past 50 year thi exchang began around 1952 thu for almost 50 year we have had foreign militari personnel and mission here we have sign agreement and memorandum and we have carri out militari exercis base on thi tradit which ha never been question over the past 40 year the defens ministri ha continu to make those decis in accord with thi interpret now the state council sai it doe not agre with that interpret and ha submit thi matter to the congress of the republ which we agre is the compet bodi for render interpret unfortun as a result of the state council s ambigu and short statement or opinion it mai be infer thi is not specif state that all militari personnel must leav colombia i imagin thei ar refer to militari personnel of colombia and other countri under thi absurd interpret on could even go so far as to expel all militari attach from colombia which would be follow with the expuls of our militari attach from other countri therefor thi is what ha place the govern in thi situat becaus word indistinct judici but the opinion of state council member there is no rule no caus no resolut the state council is not settl anyth it is onli express a doubt that the govern doe not share about a jurid interpret what ha the presid of the republ done in thi case i

acknowledg that there mai be some oppos view or some peopl oppos to these exercis but to go from that to sai that we have act unconstitution or outsid of strict complianc with treati or implement of said treati is a big differ anoth thing i would like to point out is that some of these oper ar veri much need almost indispens while other ar not the oper in juanchaco is not indispens we could have done without it in the long run it wa an oper an exercis of engin that we could have done without unfortun the opinion or judgment of the state council would involv not just that exercis but all kind of militari cooper radar assist intellig cooper all intern cooper that help us in the drug struggl would end accord to the state council s opinion we would have to violat intern treati and agreement to satisfi that opinion that is what the presid of the republ cannot do under these circumst without fail to compli with hi duti or the veri constitut which establish intern commit with which we must compli for instanc the geneva convent establish the safe passag of warship we ar signatori to that convent we can neither violat nor ignor it becaus of a judgment issu by a colombian judici bodi we

and introduc penalti for the public of unverifi inform detriment to the state and to civil peac but without prevent journalist engag in critic base on fact democraci and it principl must becom a mean for strengthen rather than weaken the state not a singl polit forc can or should claim to be absolut correct and consequ to exercis absolut power it is necessari to consolid all forc in societi without divid them into red white brown and so on thi approach ha prove pernici for our statehood over the last few decad the econom chao todai ha been compound by interethn conflict the collaps of moral foundat and cultur heritag and final the crisi of polit power instead of a middl class which in all civil societi compris the scientif technic and creativ intelligentsia skill worker and entrepreneur we have creat a minut privileg stratum of dealer while the remain strata ar undergo headlong lumpen at no time and in no place ha thi path ever creat a reliabl support for democraci and state power in societi it is paradox but for mani year on end the state ha pursu an antist polici aim at the disintegr and elimin of it most import institut the armi nation domest polici and the state secur system the most acut problem face the state todai ar a to prevent a civil war b to strengthen the state institut c to prevent russia s collaps d to overcom the socioeconom crisi and save the nation e to preserv scienc cultur and educ cadr pose an especi acut problem when promot peopl to the lever of state administr societi envisag a system of measur to train administr cadr all over the world includ prerevolutionari russia ani citizen who wish to becom a profession politician ha to go through the school of upbring educ and practic befor he is allow access to polit activ in local

prestigi univers and in the cours of work abroad in the ministri includ the state depart and the cia or parti apparatu in congress and so on the result is a skill functionari meet the need of hi societi s rule circl but even here mistak cannot be avoid the polar of polit forc and their grow confront take the most uncivil form in russia not onli did not end with the elimin of the russian feder suprem soviet but ar actual intensifi the elect campaign consider stimul thi process consequ it is probabl that on section of the rule elit will succe in crystal into a clearli defin parti structur which will attempt to establish control first over the govern and then over the presid de facto reviv the on parti polit system the access of such a parti to power will in turn inevit lead first to a clash between the presid and the feder assembl and then to a leadership struggl within the rule parti itself unfortun the histori of the ussr and the cpsu offer us numer tragic exampl of such develop of event in thi context from the state s point of view there is need for measur for legisl and polit regul of parti activ make provis for temporari suspens of the activ of all parti and sociopolit organ in the event that the natur of their polit activ becom damag to the state s secur thi kind of decis and thi is of fundament import must be made and monitor by the suprem organ of state power subject to on immut condit polit decis must under no circumst becom the prerog of execut and monitor organ like the mvd ministri of intern affair the ministri of secur the prosecutor s offic and so on in our view the ideal author to make such decis would be the judiciari the real strengthen of the aithor and potenti of the judiciari must becom a prioriti task in russia s state build base our analysi on the suprem interest of the state and the nation we have conclud that firm author is need todai the most effect indisput and bloodless form for russia could be an interim presidenti rule monitor by the feder assembl if we were to leav asid polit bia and the ambit of polit leader and forc desir to make capit out of discord in russia we ar confid that mani of our fellow citizen would agre even an imperfect leader of the nation is better than a group of polit leader look primarili after their own interest and corrupt element strain to come to power dure the most difficult time in russia s histori feudal strife invas the time of troubl the countri emerg victori have mobil all it resourc and the spiritu potenti of the mass under a singl leader s leadership the soviet era wa no except see that stalin s dictatorship wa object a posit factor of victori in world war ii and of the countri s reemerg from the ruin the press occasion write that russia todai feel not onli the urgent need but even the inevit of the appear of an authoritarian regim capabl of extric the countri from the crisi some peopl assum that russia ha alreadi taken thi path and therefor the question is not how to avoid a transit to authoritarian but to choos it most accept form and the method for transit we it is said have alreadi diverg from the possibl form and norm of a develop democrat state in the transit period it is therefor necessari to accept thi fact as an object exist realiti and second to try and find a method peac and the on most accept for the state of transit to on of the more prefer form of authoritarian thi assum that new qualiti will be demand of the repres of the authoritarian form of rule leader of the nation rather than of a parti staunch defend of the state and it interest rather than leader of reform a builder rather than a destroy in other word a major revis of the prioriti and valu which have been domin in the last few year the list of these charact qualiti could be logic extend to includ a seriou chang in the disposit of polit forc the transform of recent alli and friend into polit oppon and the obvers the attract of broad strata of profession and specialist not commit to ani on polit parti or movement it mai happen that instead of authoritarian we could end up with incess struggl intrigu by differ group parti and junta and attempt coup with the state and the nation at stake ani such struggl which ha becom an accept form of exist for these leader and a part of their essenc will inevit and for a long time to come hinder and delai the stabil of the situat in the countri and will weaken our might the countri s earliest possibl extric from the crisi and the gradual format of durabl democrat foundat of a civil societi ar import for russia becaus real democraci is possibl onli in a societi where there ar no mortal threat against the state and the nation 2 improv of the feder structur prevent of region fragment what should russia be like follow the disappear of the superpow the soviet union from the world map it former constitut call it the russian feder but is thi realli true a genuin feder is possibl onli when two or sever state ar unit and as a rule it is base on last integr without the right to seced the autonomi of a union state s compon is guarante insofar as it doe not threaten the state s uniti precis thi principl wa us in form the major of feder state exist todai the unit state switzerland canada germani true enough some other state also style themselv as feder argentina brazil mexico venezuela india and spain for exampl essenti howev thei ar unitari state with a certain amount of autonomi for their provinc pseudofeder in the classic sens of the word world experi ha shown that a durabl feder state is possibl onli when it is form by autonom state keen to unit by dint of variou vital import reason more recent histor exampl alreadi prove that ani attempt to creat a feder out of immatur nation and territori format inevit engend instabl and disintegr which swiftli lead to the collaps of newli form state or the format of a unitari state the soviet union wa a feder onli in name proclaim by it constitut but in essenc wa in our view a typic pseudofeder it is well known that a treati between a seri of republ wa conclud in 1922 but in the strict jurid and legal sens not a singl on of the compon agre to the union wa a state as for the rsfsr russian soviet feder socialist republ as on of the contract parti to the creation of the ussr from the veri begin it wa also a pseudofeder both in form and in it inner composit the conclus of the feder treati in it present form did not solv the problem either with whom did the feder compon conclud the treati with the feder state structur to be precis if thei repres a singl state it emerg that the russian it numer largest peopl compris more than 80 percent of the popul ar dispers among the feder compon sinc their own statehood is not even mention furthermor tatarstan and the chechen republ did not sign the feder treati while the stanc of a seri of republ and region as regard the distribut of power is threaten the russian feder s uniti it is fair to ask is the newli emerg russia not a wors variat of the same old pseudofeder it ha to be object note that ever sinc the collaps of the russian empir the ethnic russian have been gradual lose their statehood thi is the fundament question of our commun s develop in view of all that ha been said abov will russia be abl to becom a genuin feder state the fatherland s histori contain sever exampl of attempt to impos a feder unif of territori dure the kievan period right until the invas by the golden hord dure the suzdal muscovi period dure the time of troubl and in 1917 right after the februari revolut it is of cours possibl todai to blame the soviet power for fail to take everyth into consider when form the sovereign republ but the main point is that mani peopl acquir or restor their statehood precis thank to the soviet power the pull toward integr and uniti of the peopl of both russia and the former ussr stem from numer factor the territori which thei inhabit eurasia throughout the mani centuri of their exist these peopl have on mani occas unit within state format and have produc uniqu cultur and singl spiritu area thei perceiv eurasia as their motherland contin whose fate is insepar from the fate of each on of it peopl experi show that whenev the eurasian ethnic group have fail to reach accord their land have becom easi prei for aggressor the struggl for eurasia s repartit could disrupt the world geopolit equilibrium and caus a global catastroph anoth common featur of russia s peopl is the highli polyetnn natur of all newli form state onli six of the multitud of russian peopl claim more than 50 percent of indigen popul in their republ the chuvash account for 69 percent the tuvinian for 64 percent the komi permyak for 60 percent the chechen for 58 percent the buryat in aga buryat autonom okrug for 54 percent and the ossetian for 53 percent the averag indigen popul in all russian feder republ is 32 percent and even less 10 5 percent in autonom okrug it is simpli imposs to divid all thi into some sort of state format the follow conclus suggest itself russia s peopl ar destin to live in on state feder in spirit and form so what ar the wai to solv the nation state question in russia there ar two main danger appar in the possibl develop of nation process todai the first is the uncontrol explos of russian nation as a natur defens reaction to the threat of russia s fragment and to the insult of nation digniti take the form of the russophobia and chauvin typic of some former union republ and of individu nation region in russia itself but the establish of nationalist dictatorship is no solut the lament experi of such dictatorship and regim in a seri of state which emerg on the territori of the ussr offer convinc proof of thi territori and state collaps is as a rule the price that ha to be paid for the triumph of nation idea the second danger li in the attempt to turn russia back to it prerevolut state structur divid it into guberniya in practic term thi would mean the forc colon of nation republ the right which non russian peopl have acquir can no longer be withdrawn or curtail without tragic consequ for them and for the russian nation russian or ani other nation will not onli lead inevit to the destruct of russia s integr but will also render the statehood of these veri peopl just a pipedream the ideal wai to a genuin feder state is to conclud a full blood feder treati between the republ russia s krai and oblast as feder compon must enjoi equal right with the republ with a possibl subsequ establish of new integr format guberniya laender the more extens the level of self govern the more last will be the real integr between feder compon includ the russian region the comprehensivess of thi integr elimin the problem of the russian nation s possibl self dismember in the event that krai and oblast ar elev to the level of republ thu feder could be found simultan on the nation state nation territori and territori principl which would be most in line with russia s specif featur there is need to constitution enshrin the right of nation group and the guarante of cultur autonomi in thi process it will be import to sensibl distribut power between central and local organ of power and administr sinc the two organ of power parliament and govern combin all the origin featur of a multin state in the person of deputi and member of the govern thei would appear to personifi to a larg extent the compon of the feder and their peopl and then the center s authoritarian within the limit of it power would be accept with understand on the other hand authoritarian in the form of a presidenti republ in russia s specif condit could spark off conflict which would be diffitul to overcom and in the event of the adopt of decis which mai be disadvantag for some of it compon it mai even prompt nation agit and protest nonetheless experi show that at critic moment in histori authoritarian as a temporari measur mai be necessari and furthermor justifi the format of a genuin feder russian state will offer an opportun to reviv the larg lost ti with nearbi foreign countri the time and extent of thi new rapproch of peopl from the former ussr will depend primarili on russia s stabil and prosper thi will happen sooner or later and when it doe the eurasian contin will see the emerg of a new commun of free peopl and state qualit differ from all other in the past mainli due to the genuin feder principl underpin it build if oblast even enlarg on ural republ far east republ and so on were to be given the right to have their own parliament constitut embassi and so on thi would run contrari to both intern experi and common sens ani sovereign of administr oblast in todai s condit will lead to the feder s transform into a confeder in light of the current weaken of power thi would be the quickest wai to the state s collaps with all the ensu econom and social consequ which would be extrem seriou for all evid of thi can be seen in the consequ of the soviet union s collaps a strengthen of separat is also possibl even if compon do not formal seced from the feder someth which can alreadi be notic todai what attitud should be taken toward the strive of the leadership of some sovereign republ to take advantag of the feder state s weaken so as to expand their right still further and acquir a special statu in the feder someth like associ member practic ha convincingli confirm that ani excess expans of compon right lead to a weaken and even the collaps of the feder case of secess from the feder by joint accord of all interest side ar isol the state of singapor from malaysia other attempt secess have usual been put down by forc the sonderbund in switzerland the southern state in the unit state biafra in nigeria and so on and even if thei did succe on occas thi wa the result of militari oper against the feder the separ of bangladesh from pakistan in 1970 natur thi wai to preserv the state s uniti is unaccept to us the state laender or provinc compris feder abroad usual exercis onli the right which have been either vest in them by the central power or enshrin in the constitut on the basi

nation heterogen popul mix neither the constitut nor the feder treati of the russian feder make provis for the compon right to seced from the feder and self determin is exercis within the framework of a feder state which is not bound to uncondition grant to a republ s popul the right to separ even if such a demand ha been back by the major of the popul in a referendum ani such referendum is unlaw and it result can have onli a polit not a legal signific the threat to seced from the feder which can be heard everi now and again run contrari to both the constitut and the feder treati therefor thei have no legal effect and in our view ought to be resolut cut short bear in mind the vast advantag which the republ have alreadi gain thank to their membership of the russian feder their leader ought to abandon their attempt to further expand their right to the point which is tantamount to secess while the legitim right of republ and oblast ought to be cover by addit treati with the feder the forc of law is better than the law of forc the law enabl it us the extent of feder compon right is determin not through barter or some sort of deal result in their curtail or expans it is clearli

enjoi these right the principl of self determin protect the interest of all peopl and curb nation egot thi is precis why it remain the basi of nation polici both in the russian feder and in the world

in the commun state a certain step up of autarki breakdown of exist ti and alien thi contradict determin the logic of mutual relat between the ni which develop in two opposit direct first there wa an increasingli notic manifest of interst relat establish of custom regim and border most republ the baltic countri ukrain kyrgyzstan moldova georgia azerbaijan belaru kazakhstan ar introduc either nation currenc or ersatz monei on the basi of autonom emiss the financi system is be structur balanc of payment and trade ar be determin the former ussr foreign debt asset and liabil ar be divid debt account is be establish and so on second integr feel ar grow or at least the desir for an earli break is weaken in most former republ except latvia and estonia and partli lithuania and turkmenistan nonetheless todai it is still prematur to talk of integr or disintegr what we ar observ for the time be is the coexist not of the ni but of real author at differ level in these ni for exampl how is it possibl to treat as part of russian kazakhstani relat the tripartit polit econom union of kazakhstan tatarstan and bashkortostan which wa sign in august 1992 and under which bashkortostan ceas deliv oil product to russian depart in 1994 it will be necessari either to make effort to place russia s relat with the ni on the firm basi of intern law or to creat suprast structur with power of author it is more than like that both form will develop in the immedi futur the format of civil relat between the ni will be influenc by the follow factor the incomplet disintegr of the ussr as a result of which the subject of interst relat have not been final defin it is possibl that their number mai be either increas if separat intensifi in russia moldova georgia ukrain and so on or reduc if the process of integr ar intensifi two fundament differ principl ar clearli manifest the nation territori separ into autonom republ and nation territori format and the region separ into pure russian region analysi show that the russian feder s disintegr will hardli end up as a sovereignti bandwagon of autonom format the indigen etnnic group repres even a rel major in onli 11 out of the 31 nation territori format separatist mood ar intensifi in proper russian region in the far east the ural kuban siberia thi ha not been observ either in the ni or in east european countri the follow forecast can be made for 1994 retent of an economi with a price structur out of kilter with world price in 1993 russia suppli product to the ni at price equival to 30 40 percent of world price while purchas from them at price equival to 70 percent of world price and consequ russia had a posit balanc of about 750 billion rubl in trade with the ni in the first six month deterior of the situat of etnnic russian in the ni have becom an ethnic minor there the situat is be aggrav by the fact that virtual all the ni be multin have opt for the nationalist idea in strengthen the state lukewarm attitud of the world commun primarili of the g 7 countri toward individu ni and the structur of mutual relat prevail in the post soviet area it ought to be note in thi context that first in 1992 1993 the major of ni lost their illus about western aid but certain hope remain that some would be integr within the ec while other would draw closer to asian countri and would enjoi their support second there is a steadili grow econom depend on the west and third there is an increasingli clearli manifest tendenc by the west to pursu mainli it own interest in relat with the ni for exampl squeez russia out of the arm market and other technolog market increas purchas of energi sourc from russia at the expens of deliveri to nearbi foreign countri and so on sever system of collabor between the ni will be form in 1994 in on wai or anoth prioriti is be given to the problem of structur the geopolit area with the aim of boost stabil in the region and the manag of polit process 5 wai to form a civil societi term

these thinker perceiv the possibl of a rel autonom social life exist outsid state control there ar two approach toward the civil societi in world scienc todai 1 as a packag of social relat counterpos

it is no accid that these two idea have been juxtapos for a long time the concept of the struggl against crime in the countri wa offici built upon the wither awai of crimin phenomena dure the process of socialist and communist build the struggl against it wa assign mainli to law enforc organ in other word it wa base on repress crimin law method the prevent of crime which wa discuss at such length wa never properli launch thi soft approach toward crime as a phenomenon without ani deep econom and sociopolit root onli drove the problem deeper the law enforc organ were forc to manipul statist by artifici inflat or deflat the real indic crime in russia reach an unpreced scale in 1992 about 2 8 million crime were commit and thi figur includ a more than 40 percent rise in the number of premedit

third thi trend persist also in 1993 but the number of record crime hardli reflect the true pictur accord to some expert estim recent there have been some 10 12 million crime commit in russia each year the statist do not includ 80 percent of embezzl case 90 percent of fraud case and the overwhelm number of rape case some 352 000 person have been kill or maim by crimin dure the last four year more than 172 000 person have been kill in road traffic accid and fire these figur ar compar onli with war casualti the crimin world is becom more profession and is acquir modern technolog and weapon the rise crime pose a real threat to nation secur and the polici of implement of reform it is perfectli obviou that crime like a mirror reflect the gener condit of our societi and primarili of it foundat the economi organ crime is becom a special danger for societi in the period of polit and econom chang in the countri the russian mafia is becom more cruel and more brazen than it counterpart abroad more than 4 000 origan crimin commun have been expos in russia includ over 1 000 with intern and interregion link on out of everi four group is protect by corrupt functionari in differ structur accord to expert estim these relat involv up to 40 percent of entrrepreneur and two third of all commerci structur so far the effort to combat thi grow threat have fail to produc ani tangibl result thi threat ha not even been legisl defin therefor we feel that the best possibl definit is contain in the un secretari gener s report a organ crime is the activ of associ or crimin individu or group

thei normal bring into it the method of violenc and intimid there is an expans of crimin organ in russia and thi is precondit primarili by the growth of sociopolit instabl and the weaken of state structur in the countri at a time when the new democrat institut ar still weak the new categori of crimin activ includ the illeg sale of weapon in condit of instabl both in russia and in nearbi

more than 1 5 million russian citizen regularli us drug for nonmed purpos an intens process of fuse gener crimin activ and econom crime drug traffick and corrupt is under wai in the countri there is no doubt that the neg effect of organ crime on our societi is grow and affect all it structur at individu collect and state level be a cynic form of lawless which malici violat citizen right and constitut guarante in thi context a special danger is pose by corrupt and it consequ the take of illeg advantag of state offic to gain person benefit is a breed ground for crimin group whose leader consid the payment of sundri bribe to offici as on form of invest their fund we have at present a fine tune system of briberi in the credit financ sphere the trade network transport and the organ

tatar mongol invas the cultur problem is far broader than the problem of the present polit power of econom reform and of state reorgan the nation must find the strength and method to comprehend and resolv it regardless of what the author might do especi sinc cultur is more viabl than all polit regim ideolog and state it is a question onli of the price and method of cultur s self preserv as a

the process of overcom the past and bring the fatherland s cultur back to the mainstream of world develop soon enough took a special path again thi ha prove to be the path of level the fatherland s cultur polit ha onc again stealthili and on the quiet assum the function of cultur decid onc again on the latter s behalf what from the past is suitabl for the civil societi model and what ha to be

actual fact freedom as such doe not in ani wai guarante the flourish of creativ nowadai mani peopl repeat the old truism poverti is the worst form of slaveri creativ peopl ar becom hostag of commerci the naiv polit faith of mani intellectu in politician ha prove fatal how mani notabl figur ar now silent have been traumat by the fact that thei perceiv as beacon some politician who prove to be noth but decept will o the wisp at the same time in a situat wherebi we ar more than like not onli to experi a buildup of catastroph tension in all sphere of societi s life but also to see the peopl driven into apathi and listless right up to the point where the desir and actual will to live ar dull and societi is paralyz becaus noth is sacr and mandatori for peopl in thi situat we ar begin to see the emerg of a stratum of peopl with the qualiti and function of a new intelligentsia the intelligentsia is not affili to ani polit stream it doe not serv either the state or the parti or the church or even the peopl intellig as a human qualiti doe not speak on anyon s behalf but it own base on the theoret principl of knowledg the theoret natur of the new intelligentsia s judgment doe not at all mean that it is aloof from the realiti of life now for exampl it cannot adopt an indiffer attitud toward the russian govern in thi regard the intelligentsia doe not fit anywher within the rang of viewpoint held by variou polit group and variou social strata of the popul from a sounder point of view it can be seen that a chang of govern and of author in gener will inevit result in replac the immatur inconsist at time simpli foolish and clumsi democraci but democraci nonetheless with a quasi democraci thi is the ground on which intellectu determin their attitud toward the govern todai but from the fundament posit the present situat call more for understand rather than for approv or condemn to comprehend and to announc it conclus to societi thi is the function of the new intelligentsia politician intellectu parti and movement want success a member of the intelligentsia want the truth by it veri natur the new intelligentsia need more than anyth els the fullest possibl democraci and it is the on that can util it best of all thi mean that it is capabl of be a kind of regul of the degre and form of democraci the new intelligentsia is also the bearer of optim in a societi of skeptic and cynic of gloom and pessim it optim is base on it abil to perceiv the contemporari social process in the context of world problem and their histori ani parti approach evalu event and their consequ in term of year or decad while the new intelligentsia s supraparti and apolit approach enabl it to think in term of the world and of centuri the new kind of intelligentsia presuppos an independ moral it scorn moral prejudic and the domin spirit of the time in the condit of gener accept deceipt and camouflag it is capabl of sincer of the salutari self restrict to noth but implac point out ani manifest of immor to other and in all other instanc imput to dissid noth but intellectu confus the intelligentsia s moral rule out the most perman diseas of intellectu egot and it preach the principl love not me but mine at a time when malici intent selfish and decept in action ar becom an everydai occurr the moral of a member of the intelligentsia call for inact as the last mean of demonstr disagr thi veri intelligentsia will becom the third forc which in condit of mass hostil to all parti program and everyth els that divid and embitt will mediat in relat between the peopl and the author will comprehend and explain their role and limit and will bring about a mutual sensibl moder we see the role of prosecutor be plai even by mani gener of literatur the art the human and the social scienc who until quit recent strove to grab a seat on honorari presidium as close as possibl to politburo member glorifi socialist realism and head creativ union scientif research institut and newspap

of novel poem movi and monograph compris the world s most advanc socialist cultur for the time be mani of our intellectu ar live just for the dai carri awai by an exagger impress of their own import in the fatherland s spiritu ruin thi is what the author valu but time is pass and thei need more and more peopl capabl of build rather than destroi there ar veri few of them and thei made wiser by experi ar try to keep their distanc from the author thi offer that much more scope for those who ar dilig in seek the bless of the power that be but ani author s special treatment of the master of the

wa also the judiciari as a matter of fact right until the conciliar code wa compil in 1649 church rule often fill in the gap in state law compris the princ jurisdict it is understand that thi great import of the episcop s judici power wa base primarili on it moral author dure the pre mongol period the metropolitan and bishop often had to reconcil princ at time of civil strife essenti the orthodox church at the time plai the role of a most import factor of nation uniti let us recal that dure the sad dai of the octob 1993 crisi it wa the orthodox church that again took on thi histor role and it is not to blame for the fact that the voic of reason wa not heed it is necessari to dwell on the follow fact grand princ ivan danilovich kalita of muscovi invit metropolitan petr of kiev and all ru to settl in hi capit the foundat of the cathedr of the assumpt of the holi mother of god were laid in the kremlin thi made moscow the perman center of the russian orthodox church give it at

russia s histori offer numer instruct exampl of state organ in parallel with the monarch natur of power in the major of russian land dure the period preced the format of the unifi moscow state we can

as the prototyp of russia s futur democrat structur underpin by the primaci of christian valu but no matter what attitud we mai adopt toward russia s histori follow the unif of ru under the author of the grand princ of muscovi it is necessari to admit that the orthodox church continu to plai an import role in the consolid of russian statehood the 17th centuri prove to be especi import the time of troubl immedi follow the reign of bori godunov which wa mark by a seri of disast and mainli a devast famin again brought forth the orthodox church as the most import factor of nation self awar without which it would have been imposs to pursu state build in russia thu the church s bless of the nizhnii novgorod resist made it possibl to preserv russian statehood in 1612 in 1613 the holi synod in other word the episcop of the russian church and lead repres of it clergi launch the initi of conven an assembl of the land to elect a head of the russian state thi assembl at which the estat of the

privileg from the suprem author but to answer the question of how the russian state should be structur at that time the elect of mikhail the first czar from the romanov dynasti wa condit by the fact that hi father the prestigi boyar fedor romanov who had been forc to becom a monk by bori godunov and later becam metropolitan filaret of rostov and yaroslavl patriarch of all ru in 1619 1633 wa an

if the monarch wa unabl to exercis hi right and duti exercis suprem power in the countri until such time as the legitim claimant to the throne wa sworn in as head of the russian state it must be especi note that the russian church hierarchi plai an extrem fruit role in lawmak activ in which it wa brought by the suprem state power also in the 18th centuri later on when a repres organ of the

swiftli deal with it polit the multiparti system which is capabl of produc a seriou struggl for power is still at it embryon stage as it were in our countri nonetheless we ar inde at a stage of crisi at present and thi crisi is moral the main question face russia now is what should be the moral guidelin of it futur state build thi question ha to be answer by the peopl themselv it would be appropri to recal the tradit form of dialogu between the suprem power and the peopl by conven an assembl of the land which could compris authorit repres of all social and profession group and the tradit religi

will not mean that it is regain ani state function or privileg but be an authorit social institut in the countri todai it will thu fulfil it purpos and will help the russian peopl to preserv their

social militari and other factor not directli associ with financ ha aggrav thi packag of problem severalfold there is no doubt that all these neg factor and their impact on the financi system will persist also in 1994 at the same time there ar also the mistak and error commit recent which call for special mention the last two year have shown that the overcom of the slump in product and the acceler of structur chang in russia s nation economi cannot be guarante exclus by the mean of monetari and credit polici furthermor such an approach is flaw in it veri foundat in the condit of inflat the capit of enterpris and bank ar be swiftli devalu while credit oper ar be essenti curtail even though the indic without ani adjust for inflat speak of an appar growth of credit oper and foreign currenc on balanc sheet if thei were to be adjust for inflat thei would be sharpli reduc the main caus of inflat ar the sharp declin of product the arbitrari price set by enterpris in condit of monopol and commod shortag the budget deficit the breakdown of econom ti with enterpris in former union republ and cema countri and the export of russian commod at dump price these ar the factor that lead to an imbal between the monei in circul and the commod avil for purchas error in the implement of econom reform and the super rigid monetarist credit polici togeth with confus in calcul have intensifi the slump in product and fuel inflat the main lever for hold inflat back ought to be the credit support for viabl enterpris if enterpris do not receiv credit to meet product cost and cover defer payment thei would be altogeth unabl to function and due to mass product stoppag inflat would be mani time greater in condit that encourag incess price increas and declin of the rubl s purchas power it is imposs to achiev normal commod monei circul includ the mainten of balanc between the total price of commod in circul and the total amount of monei releas into circul what should be the specif measur that would make it possibl to satisfi the commod market at price accept by the major of the popul on of the strateg solut is to restrict the amount of monei in circul last year thi result in a huge total of reciproc nonpay price went up and the enterpris monei evapor but credit emiss is still be curtail by whip up interest rate the rubl s purchas power is fall uncontrol becaus price ar rise without restraint the imbal between the valu of commod in circul and the total amount of monei in circul is widen in a normal econom process monei serv as a technic mean of payment when exchang for commod if there is no monei commod monei circul is slow down and disrupt sinc commod product is curtail although everyon cite the need for credit emiss to be held back by the central bank commod produc enterpris ar in debt thi is confirm by the correl of the growth of price and of monei in circul over a two year period the former increas by a factor of between 100 and 1 000 while the total amount of monei increas onli by a factor of 10 to 15 while commod produc ar cut back and curtail product the budget deficit is grow at a mad pace each year but how ar the state s inordin rise expens to be cover if the enterpris revenu ar fall and consequ budget revenu from taxat ar reduc the differ approxim 20 trillion rubl will have to be cover by monei emiss thi reveal the main caus of inflat budget expenditur ar begin to exce the total valu of commod produc for circul but we cannot avoid deliber and control inflationari expenditur on invest and the product of commod produc even five year ago the countri would have need trillion of rubl to replac worn out equip and thu ensur simpl reproduct thi account for 50 to 60 percent of all fix asset in product at todai s price the amount of monei need would be 1 000 time greater without restor the fix asset we will be unabl to build a market economi and solv social problem meanwhil invest in the last two year have been scanti furthermor a sizeabl proport ha been devalu becaus the invest period span sever year invest in product have been reduc by a factor of about five compar with the minimum that is necessari enterpris ar consum their depreci reserv let alon their profit thi is yet anoth consequ of irrespons and the fals percept of econom freedom evid we should not count on the foreign credit that have been promis therefor in order to reviv the economi we will be unabl to manag without inflationari credit emiss but a credit emiss that is accur verifi and control it must be note that in a healthi econom system high interest rate ar set in order to reduc inflat in our own condit todai high interest rate prompt a faster pace of price increas and further devalu of monei fast growth of commod product can be achiev by lower interest rate while acceler the turnov of fund and provid target credit for the economi thi mean an econom effect for both creditor and commod produc thi is the wai to extric ourselv more swiftli from the grip of inflat but we will chang noth in our life todai without solv the gener question of financi and econom polici without establish firm rule of the game it is after all no secret mani peopl ar in favor of a market without rule primarili middlemen trader and dealer as well as some commerci bank with their high interest rate for credit fund by their borrow from the central bank which itself set the tone in thi sphere the rule of the game in the market todai can be establish onli by gener agreement between all side thi is normal behavior in develop countri the destruct of what ha alreadi been creat will continu without such an agreement without ani organ principl the monetari credit system the dispar between the bank system model in russia and other countri is the main caus hinder their integr in a singl financi area the model appli in russia ar substanti differ from the model of the world s bank busi and encourag the specul commerci accumul of capit rather than it invest in product suppli commod to the market the second import reason hinder the integr of the russian and the world s monetari credit system is the underdevelop of modern long term form of settlement in russia in these condit the attempt to elabor the best possibl cours in credit polici and reform the system of settlement in the nation economi is perceiv by the central bank of russia as a prioriti task the object of the bank of russia s monetari credit polici ar enshrin in the basic guidelin of monetari credit regul in 1993 ratifi by the suprem soviet and in the 24 mai 1993 econom polici statement by the govern and the central bank both document set the main task of slow down inflat which devalu the popul s monei incom and save deform product and trade and distort econom guidelin for particip in econom relat proceed from the premis that the rate of inflat depend on the rate of monei suppli it ought to be expect that after a certain time lag credit restrict should result in a slow down of price increas but inflat stood at 20 percent in june 22 percent in juli 26 percent in august and 23 percent in septemb dure the first nine month of 1993 wholesal and consum price increas by a factor of 7 3 and 6 3 respect thu the basic approach toward the curb of inflat ha prove useless the rise price of energi sourc of ga in februari and of coal in juli remain the main factor of inflat the monopoli statu of individu group of produc provid the main caus of the acceler increas of wholesal price and after a brief interv of consum price as well inflat in russia is expect to reach 900 to 1 000 percent in 1993 as a whole the state of the monetari credit sphere remain veri complex it is not onli instabl in the economi but also uncertainti as regard the state budget that hinder ani forecast of the futur dynam of growth of the monei in circul and consequ ani effect regul of it level in order to ensur a stabl reduct of the rate of inflat the central bank s action ought to be back by an appropri budgetari and taxat polici the ineffici distribut of central credit is fraught with the danger that a new crisi of nonpay might develop larg scale financi inject might be requir in order to avoid it and thi in it turn will lead to an expans of unsatisfi effect demand and higher rate of inflat the graviti of thi threat is prove even more graphic by the fact that 40 percent of central credit receiv by enterpris ar us by them to cover current debt it is necessari to enhanc the effici of supervis and control of the activ of commerci bank when financ region program it is necessari to util the potenti of credit partnership and the advantag of mortgag credit and to creat municip bank as regard target state credit these fund ought to be primarili channel into the implement of specif project associ with the develop of market infrastructur at region level the most import prerequisit for an effici credit polici and the improv of the payment and settlement system is to preserv the common econom area and the unifi monetari credit and bank system within russia s framework settlement between ci state on of the most complex problem concern

law that might be need must be adopt a major mistak is be commit todai attempt ar made to restrain inflat by virtual noth but monetarist method by rais the base rate and rigidli limit the credit for

that will have to be creat for them the real burden that will be impos on the social infrastructur at place where migrant will concentr and so on the return of russian from former ussr republ and the migrat of repres of non russian peopl to russia began long befor interethn tension reach the stage of open conflict and becam a bargain chip in polit struggl even back in 1979 1988 the posit balanc of the migrat to russia by russian who had formerli activ resettl in other republ wa in excess of 300 000 the growth of the scale of migrat wa also affect by the outflow of nonindigen peopl from region where non russian titular ethnic group had concentr in russia itself the northern caucasu the volga vallei the siberian transbayk region and the northern belt of the feder in essenc these region show the selfsam symptom of discrimin against repres of nontitular ethnic group as in nearbi foreign countri among the advers consequ of mass migrat realli great import attach to the growth of social stress there is a signific deterior of the social awar of migrant themselv who have lost their former statu and quit often the prospect of social success there is also dissatisfact among the resid of town and villag where thei live unfortun the help given to forc migrant or refuge by the local organ of power and popul is clearli inadequ the attempt by migrant to acquir a social nich in the new local come up against seriou object difficulti the level of social tension ha increas wherev refuge ar concentr as soon as thei have appear thi is note both by the migrant themselv and by local resid the social and psycholog atmospher in which refuge find themselv is also indic by the result of a poll of the popul in 13 russian feder region when ask what polici do you support the answer were distribut as follow as percentag of the number poll accept citizen of all former ussr republ regardless of their nation 36 percent accept onli russian by descent 51 percent do not accept anyon 11 percent did not answer 2 percent on out of everi 10 person poll is against the accept of migrant while on half of those poll ar inclin toward divid refuge and migrant into our peopl and foreign these stereotyp of mass and individu awar cannot be ignor thei were graphic demonstr in practic in saratov and volgograd oblast dure the discuss of the question of settl german there and re creat a german autonom format in the volga vallei the local popul s unwelcom attitud toward migrant will intensifi as the shortag of foodstuff hous and so on worsen thi can alreadi be seen at present respond of the all russia poll were ask what will be your attitud if refuge which mai appear in your region ar alloc hous out of turn ar given job and ar help with monei from the state budget the answer were as follow 1 attitud toward help with employm nt posit 58 percent neg 15 percent difficult to answer 27 percent 2 attitud toward help with monei posit 56 percent neg 19 percent difficult to answer 25 percent 3 attitud toward help with hous posit 29 percent neg 33 percent difficult to answer 38 percent the acut of the hous problem in russia where the number of peopl wait for hous is in excess of 9 million wa clearli manifest by the fact that less than on third of those poll ar inclin to support the polici of prioriti hous alloc for forc migrant thi indic of potenti conflict rise sharpli when the ethnic composit of migrant doe not coincid with the titular ethnic group at their new place of settlement in other word mass migrat is fraught with a chain reaction of interethn conflict the symptom of which can alreadi be seen specif thei take the form of grow nation and attempt to initi pogrom against peopl of differ nation or religion in oblast which have taken in larg number of migrant there ar differ forecast about the migrat of russian to russia the number of potenti migrant could includ virtual all 25 million russian live in nearbi foreign countri some 4 5 million peopl in the next 5 10 year thi is the maximum size of the migrat flow which could be prompt either in the event of exacerb of interethn relat or as a result of the start of combat oper on the territori of former union republ accord to feder migrat servic data over the next 12 18 month we can expect between 650 000 and 1 2 million peopl to arriv in russia from nearbi foreign countri 300 000 400 000 from ukrain and belaru 250 000 550 000 from central asia and kazakhstan 40 000 100 000 from the transcaucasu and 25 000 45 000 from the baltic countri the mass migrat of russian from ukrain and belaru to russia and of ukrainian and belarusian to ukrain and belaru can happen onli in the event of militari conflict between the republ although in ukrain for exampl there ar even now forc prepar to instig thi process the situat with russian is even more complex in kazakhstan where there ar about 6 million of them on fourth of all russian live in former union republ outsid the russian feder there is a larg flow of russian migrant from kazakhstan thi trend is grow it is possibl to forecast three avenu and consequ three period of the migrat of russian to russia an activ migrat of first and second gener russian is expect from turkmenistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan azerbaijan uzbekistan and kazakhstan between 30 and 50 percent of the russian speak popul intend to emigr from there some 18 20 percent of russian intend to leav latvia estonia lithuania moldova georgia and armenia up to 11 percent of russian express desir to leav ukrain and belaru accord to poll result about 2 million russian intend to move to russia todai becaus thei feel persecut along nation and linguist line both now and in the futur the forc migrant from union republ ar mainli engin technician skill industri worker teacher and physician in other word strictli urban peopl who will be unabl to settl in the larg citi becaus of resid permit problem thei cannot bui or build hous in town becaus the law forbid it thi is why mani of them perceiv their situat as hopeless there is hardli ani need to comment on the polit view of present and futur migrant or their attitud toward the new polit and econom realiti which have turn them into outcast there ar six special and transit recept point for refuge open and function on russia s territori there is discuss of the possibl of set up similar point and region migrat servic in everi oblast the committe for migrat affair proce from the premis that thi is not onli a calam but also to a certain extent a benefit for russia the govern is begin to realiz that the recept and settlement of migrant will requir larg invest but those return to their histor motherland ar almost the most enterpris skill and industri part of the nation a public committe for the settlement of forc migrant is function in just under on year it ha process about 1 million person and ha help 20 000 but the work on migrat problem is fragment there is no coordin at state level and resourc ar be wast mani categori of migrant have found themselv altogeth outsid the sphere of state regul it is clear that the feder migrat servic will not be abl to cope with the swell flood of migrant on it own the situat call for immedi action there is need for a packag of interlink measur and coordin action by state migrat organ the foreign ministri the committe for emerg situat the state committe for nation affair and the public organ in other word there is need for a nationwid feder program for help to our compatriot furthermor thi program must be given top prioriti from the materi financi and the polit diplomat point of view alik the state s polici toward migrat need more than just seriou amend bear in mind the provision qualit and quantit apprais of migrat and it sociopolit consequ we ar talk about actual elabor a new all embrac and effect migrat polici it main action and principl would appear to be the follow help for forc migrant must includ not onli the provis of compens land credit and employ inform but also the lift of all restrict on resid permit and the choic of place of resid migrant togeth with all other russian must be given equal right to bui and sell at russia s hous and labor market and not be made hostag of suprem state interest the swell or subsid of migrat process will depend at the veri least on polit decis by the leadership of variou republ about protect the right of ethnic minor and the pace at which the indigen of the republ popul proce there must be no delai in elabor more precis guidelin in mutual relat between former ussr republ and compon of the russian feder it is obviou without ani addit research that todai we need to conclud between the sovereign state former ussr republci a treati on the right of ethnic minor to work educ

must revisit the problem of the russian languag s statu it must be given the statu of state languag wherev it is us by the major of the popul thi approach is in line with intern norm and would obvious promot the further harmon of interst relat there also is a press need to conclud interst agreement on human right with all former union republ monitor of their fulfil could be carri out at both state and public level the statu of econom relat with variou state must depend on the observ of these intern agreement and the principl of intern law it is expedi to support the creation of trade and econom

peopl of russia ar fratern for the russian peopl our peopl desir to live in peac and friendship with the peopl of all other countri our concern about the fate of russian peopl is not aim against other peopl and state russia s path lead through peac solut of problem and mutual cooper to univers and just peac 5 problem of russia s econom mutual relat with ci countri the rate of the slump in product and inflat continu to grow in ci countri in 1993 the govern of not a singl ci republ succeed in halt the process of econom declin on the whole the total volum of industri product in the commun wa reduc by 20 percent in compar price over the year the share slump wa not affect to ani larg degre by the differ natur and pace of econom reform in differ countri in the condit of transpar border and unifi monei circul within the rubl zone the lack of coordin in econom activ hurt the financ of neighbor the imbal in reciproc deliveri ha alreadi evolv into an imbal in the intern settlement of ci countri on the whole it is possibl to agre with the opinion of world bank associ k mikhalopoulo and d tarr the situat as regard trade and payment in the former soviet republ wa distinguish by chao which reflect the exist of a seri of problem the disorgan of the credit monetari and payment system wa at the heart of these problem the main problem is that the reduct of interrepubl trade will promot the further declin of the volum of output and incom therefor polit strategist will have to creat mechan for the transit period which would help the new state to restor the effect flow of trade and avoid further seriou breach of thi flow in the short term support in the longer term the restructur of their economi and it integr in the world economi after all the sharpli increas depend of each ci state on the extern market becom a condit for the function of their economi as a matter of fact these realiti ar onli just be realiz and taken into account in the econom practic of ci countri on the whole as 1993 ha shown the step up of the economi extern depend will continu thi depend will be most graphic demonstr in the sphere of satisfi the ci countri energi need sovereign ha undermin russia s potenti as energi supplier let us add for object s sake that cutback in the rate of oil extract start four year ago accord to estim by russia s ministri of fuel and energi oil extract drop by a further 50 million tonn in 1993 in other word will reach onli 340 million tonn if thi pace of reduc the extract of black gold is maintain then in the veri near futur the fuel and energi complex will be work to meet onli russia s own need which todai stand at 240 million tonn oil export increas more than threefold but thi increas wa accompani by a reduct of deliveri to ci countri by an averag of 50 percent in thi context russia could be suspect of wage a cold war against ukrain and the baltic and central asian countri but such an approach would be base on inertia of thought fact prove whether it is advantag for russia to deliv oil product to the former republ russia deliv it output primarili raw materi which ar competit on the world market to nearbi foreign countri at price equival on averag to 30 40 percent of world price and acquir from nearbi foreign countri output at price equival to about 70 percent of world price moreov in mani instanc russia often fail to receiv ani payment at all for it export for exampl have deliv to nearbi foreign countri about 50 million tonn of oil to a total valu of 6 5 billion by wai of payment it receiv machineri and equip worth onli 700 million but russia s extern econom depend wa also increas and ha almost trebl have reach 14 15 percent of gnp thi is more than in india and japan let alon the unit state extern depend demand addit foreign currenc resourc for the economi s function natur some of the sourc ar ga oil and oil product come back to the idea of cold war against ukrain it is appropri to recal on contenti problem last year ukrain sold abroad at world price of cours 8 million tonn out of the 33 5 million tonn of oil it had receiv from russia accord to some estim the amount earn from thi deal is equal to for exampl the cost of build a major intern airport at sai novosibirsk capabl of earn an annual profit to the tune of 700 800 million russia s economi todai bear the heavi burden of addit export and import expenditur associ with transit charg for cross the territori of neighbor state but the safeti of good in transit is not guarante not even by ukrain of cours the press cite numer fact about russia s debt to other ci republ but the overal balanc is thi russia had a posit balanc of about r750 billion similar trend will also persist next year even though the govern ha taken a seri of measur to put an end to nonpay apprais the situat in russia s econom ti with nearbi foreign countri it can be said that 1993 saw the start of sober up from euphoria in the ci it is of cours prematur to conclud that the balanc of centrifug and centripet forc show that the latter ar stronger but thi awaken coupl with disappoint and lost illus ha also brought in a certain proport of common sens section v v the creation of favor intern condit for the implement of reform in russia 1 exist realiti in order to elabor russia s strategi in the sphere of nation and intern secur it is necessari to analyz the posit it occupi in the world and the essenc of it intern interest as determin by the profound chang of the last few year there ar four main factor make up the system of russia s polici guidelin at least for the 1990 s the first is the fact that the soviet union ha disintegr thu put an end to the world s bipolar structur there ha been a radic chang in the geopolit role plai by russia which ha becom a compon of the world commun russia ha inherit from the ussr 75 percent of it territori 51 percent of it popul 60 percent of fix product asset in term of valu and 76 percent of enterpris produc mean of product it account for 90 percent of oil extract 73 percent of ga extract 63 percent of electr gener 80 percent of crude oil export and almost 100 percent of natur ga export it procuc more than on half of the gnp produc in the ussr in 1990 but russia is not just smaller than the ussr in size it ha found itself in a fundament new environ to the west and to the south where the former soviet republ lie furthermor some of them have been profoundli hit by domest instabl thei ar extrem suscept to extern influenc and ar in conflict with on anoth the paradox is that formal these ar foreign countri as far as russia is concern in fact howev thei remain insepar link with it both by their common histor past and by the multitud of live econom cultur social and psycholog bond the second factor russia is experienc a most profound econom and sociopolit crisi whose solut still li far into the futur at the same time by dint of it size and of the polit and strateg legaci inherit from the ussr russia remain on of the world s lead countri it will not be at all simpl for russia to find it place in the intern arena russia s new leadership bear the burden of a difficult twin task to creat a new system of foreign and domest polici ture it into a catalyst of radic market reform and at the same time to overcom the burden of problem inherit from the past the third factor the russian feder as a genuin democrat republ russia no longer ha a plan economi but it still ha not acquir a market economi the unitari state ha collaps but the best possibl balanc between central and local power ha yet to be found furthermor the feder todai face the threat of disun and fragment into separ princip final the fourth factor is associ with chang in the surround world we ar wit the onset of a more tradit but also a much more complex time of multilater diplomaci intricaci of contradict and coincid of state interest shift coalit and limit polit goal the threat of a univers war is declin but there is a grow danger of local conflict fraught with escal of combat oper in variou region all thi indic that the mainten of peac in the futur will requir activ work by intern and region organ to ensur collect secur as well as joint peacemak action by the power proceed from what ha been said abov what ar our fatherland s main foreign polici prioriti at present russia ha three interlink suprem foreign polici prioriti the first is to ensur polit stabil in the countri prevent war and settl arm conflict on the territori of the former ussr both within and between individu republ primarili by polit mean the second is to prevent the emerg of hegemon power in europ south asia and the far east which would strive to extend their influenc to region in the former ussr where the situat is unstabl the third is to preserv the statu of a great power occupi a special posit in the world s geostrateg structur the main point for russia is to ensur polit stabil and to prevent and settl conflict across the former ussr should instabl and potenti conflict there grow further thi would threaten both russia s territori integr and it econom and democrat reform the maximum desir task is econom and polit integr on the basi of equal right voluntari and mutual advantag for ci countri primarili russia ukrain kazakhstan and belaru if the desir prove unattain then the vital import minimum task for the russian feder is to prevent the creation of a hostil coalit russia is proceed from the premis that the helsinki principl of the inviol of border must provid the foundat of mutual relat between the former ussr republ ani revis of border would be permiss onli via peac talk sanction includ the us of forc would be permiss onli in the event that a countri s leadership pursu a polici of genocid toward ethnic minor and thi is recogn and defin as genocid under un rule germani turkei japan china and other ar potenti capabl of pose the threat of region hegemoni to russia in the 1990 s of cours nobodi is accus the aforement countri of current act along thi avenu but a sober forecast of the shift balanc of forc and of the geopolit situat make it mandatori to consid the possibl of chang in their polici which ar not even contempl at present the unit state is russia s most import partner in counter region hegemoni the remain center of power ar still not capabl of realli influenc the situat in hot spot be thei in the near east angola or yugoslavia the caucasu or afghanistan russia is plan to pursu thi prioriti us differ method in differ region in europ for exampl the guarante for prevent ani militari polit expansion by lead state is perceiv in the develop of european integr and the stregnthen of the csce as an organ of collect secur and collect respons to ani potenti aggressor in the past the ussr us to advoc the simultan disband of nato and the warsaw pact organ wpo not onli ha the nato bloc not been disband but is is actual build up it might thi organ cannot be smoothli transform into a european secur structur we believ that a stabil of the situat in the russian feder on the basi of market economi and the develop of democraci will creat the need for a fundament new intern organ possibl on the basi of util and develop element from the structur of the ec the west european union nato and the csce and with particip by russia the unit state and canada the russian feder s polici in asia minor malaya aziya and south asia could take the form of direct includ militari resist to outsid interfer by agreement with the republ under threat the natur of the multipolar world adjoin the transcaucasu is much more complex russia s partner here is object iran and turkei in south asia the mainten of a certain balanc between them is in line with russia s interest despit the fact that the west would obvious give prefer to turkei as a member of nato the mainten of the us militari presenc in japan is in line with russia s interest in the far east in the event of withdraw by the unit state and of china s headlong econom and militari strengthen japan s reaction could onli take the form of acceler remilitar a clash between the two huge power over korea taiwan hong kong or southeast asia could also involv russia in the conflict ani sharp chang of the balanc of forc in favor of china or japan and the emerg of hegemon aspir in on of the two power could pose a direct threat to russia s far east it is obviou that russia need to retain it posit as a great world power thi mean russia s particip in the un secur council as on of it perman member and it role in other intern structur it also mean particip as far as possibl in the mainten of peac and the repuls of aggress includ along the line of peacemak forc within the framework of the secur council the csce and other and genocid termin oper sanction by the unit nation and region intern organ russia advoc activ prevent of the prolifer of nuclear and other mass destruct weapon a tougher regim to control the deliveri of missil and missil technolog and the elabor of agre quota and restruct on the arm trade as a whole the problem of russia s militari strateg pariti with the unit state deserv special mention it will be necessari to continu the mutual balanc reduct of russian feder and us strateg nuclear forc on new term here we need a transit from mutual deterr through the abil to deliv a crush counterstrik on the aggressor to joint manag of strateg stabil thi is why talk will constitut the sphere of special mutual relat and mutual interest between russia and the unit state 2 nation interest let us examin russia s specif nation interest from the viewpoint of intern secur retain the great power statu thi is russia s natur right vest in it thank to it econom potenti the success it ha achiev in scienc cultur militari might and so on guarante eurasian stabil whenev the eurasian balanc of forc ha been disrupt russia ha tradition been the main victim therefor the desir by ani on state or coalit of state to domin eurasia will not be in russia s fundament nation interest nor can our interest be serv by attempt to isol russia squeez it out of the black sea and the baltic sea reduc foreign econom commod turnov chang it structur and so on ensur polit and econom stabil in state all along russia s border thi is a kei interest for ani power but the problem of prevent the emerg of conflict zone along the border is especi import for russia which ha the world s longest land border and with it complex relat with neighbor which ar root in the past parri and prevent potenti threat the world in which we ar live now is a world of power partnership and power rivalri within the framework of rigid durabl structur despit the chang which have occur in the last few year especi the end of the cold war the improv of relat between the unit state and russia the rapproch to a certain extent between east and west europ and so on more sophist principl of power balanc and power collabor still remain the foundat of contemporari intern relat indic like econom scientif and intellectu potenti plai a greater role in the system of state might but the militari compon still domin the structur of interst power real militari nuclear missil confront on a global level remain onli between russia and the unit state for the time be the continu of nuclear confront between our countri is object and inevit in the forese futur furthermor the grow nuclear missil potenti of the prc and west europ also pose a militari threat for russia in the 1990 s final russia s cultur secur and it origin ar threaten by the west s liber individualist ideolog to the exent that collectiv still domin awar and think and todai s russian realiti at the region level it is necessari to proce from the fact that in the event of exacerb of the domest crisi virtual all of russia s neighbor could potenti rais sundri territori claim although the econom cultur and other categori of secur ar not obvious link with militari secur mani arm conflict have start with mistak commit in nonmilitari sphere therefor the prevent of threat to russia must be activ wage across the entir spectrum thi is russia s main nation interest 3 foreign polici we deem it import to singl out the follow basic object and guidelin for defin the strategi of russia s develop and behavior in the world commun of peopl the russian feder is constantli present in the arena of world polit life it is a differ matter that russia s domest situat and it geopolit environ at present do not favor the pursuit of an activ global polici and it region interest will call for the greatest of effort in the next few year the possess of a mighti nuclear potenti doe not chang the situat either for the first time in mani year our countri is in a situat wherebi it doe not face ani definit or in ani wai signific extern militari threat territori disput involv countri which will certainli not resort to militari forc for their solut provid of cours russia remain a unit state all thi is exception advantag for concentr the countri s effort on the solut of the domest task concern radic transform and the problem constantli emerg in mutual relat with ci countri relat with germani at least over the last two centuri have occupi a central posit among the prioriti of russia s foreign polici but the experi of the 20th centuri with it two world war the cruel battl without preced in histori and the huge sacrific and destruct suffer by both side would seem to indic the irreconcil of the two countri interest true enough the period between the two war produc a whole rang of mutual advantag econom and even militari technic cooper that wa the period when the averag german realiz that the situat in germani develop well whenev it relat with russia ar good russia need a new east asian and pacif polici it backbon must be provid by relat with china as it main partner not onli in the region but also in the broader global context the posit potenti in the histori of russian chines relat is much more power than the neg both countri interest in the preserv of each other s integr is a most import factor of russian chines collabor the complex of the problem of the korean state s unif also prompt china and russia alik in the direct of a unifi approach toward maintain the immut of world war ii result in the far east both countri ar reliabl partner in the caus of uncondition observ the yalta confer decis on the far east in other word confirm outer mongolia s statu and the fact that the kuril island and south sakhalin belong to russia it is possibl to defin the follow long term interest of the secur of the russian feder preserv gener stabil in the world capabl of resist local arm conflict elimin the seat of tension close to the russian feder s territori and fraught with the explos of arm conflict maintain normal relat with all state primarili with european and asian state and elev these relat to the level of partnership strengthen and develop the peacemak potenti of the unit nation the csce and other with a view to the earliest possibl polit settlement of conflict threaten to evolv into arm clash the further deepen of the process of disarma offer an opportun to reduc the russian arm forc to the minimum level necessari to ensur extern secur and honor the russian feder s intern commit restor the russian feder s intern prestig as the legitim heir of the former soviet union and a great power recogn by the world commun the fewer the forc be divert extern the faster will the establish of russian statehood proce in the condit of the world s deepen interdepend thi can happen if the intern situat remain stabl for a number of year on end without arm conflict capabl of shake thi stabil at the same time it is imposs to rule out the probabl of local conflict flare in region where there ar confront along religi nationalist or other line unfortun these region lie along the former soviet union s southwestern and southern border it is in russia s interest to elimin ani local conflict develop in the world by polit mean and as swiftli as possibl thi is why the russian feder must support by all possibl mean the polit peacemak potenti of the unit nation the csce and other intern organ it is in our interest to follow jointli with the other power the path of deeper reduct of armament and arm forc guid by the principl of suffici for defens sensibl reduct of russia s arm forc and armament will not onli eas the econom burden but will also make it possibl to util the high technolog potenti of defens enterpris for the russian economi s recoveri when determin the size of the arm forc russia need it is also necessari to consid it commit for the mainten of univers peac russia s medium term interest includ normal and stabil both it domest situat and the situat in it immedi environ the ci countri yugoslavia and afghanistan thei includ normal and stabil relat with ci countri reach agreement with them both on the coordin of common polici and on specif action in the sphere of mutual secur elabor and introduc a system of collabor with nato countri strengthen ti between ci countri in the defens sphere achiev an accord accept to russia on settl the question concern the southern island of the kuril chain so as to lift the barrier to the develop of relat of cooper with japan agreement with the prc enshrin the fact that the side have no reciproc territori claim normal relat with the afghanistan pakistan iran triangl with a view to elabor an agreement on mutual recognit inviol of border and establish of cooper includ in the defens sphere but without in ani wai infring upon the close relat with india establish normal relat with all state which will emerg in the place of the former yugoslav feder special attent must be given to conflict flare both within and between ci countri includ arm conflict there is no time to be lost therefor the task of normal and stabil relat with the ci countri cannot be put off and must be includ among medium term task awar of the commun of interest in ensur collect defens will be an import factor of the develop of centripet forc the next two to four year will be especi import for the russian feder s futur it will be virtual imposs to resolv the task of econom reviv without elimin conflict and their potenti sourc proceed from thi premis it is possibl to defin the follow short term interest of the russian feder s secur termin interethn conflict in region adjoin the russian feder s caucasian border reach accord on an econom area within the framework of the former soviet union and the appropri border regim between state implement the accord concern the state border secur regim along the entir perimet of the former soviet union reach accord between the russian feder and other ci state on question of protect against nuclear attack and of strengthen the intern regim for the nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the sober up which is occur in ci state in the econom sphere and the grow awar of the consequ of the breakdown of econom ti indic that thi avenu could successfulli serv the solut of the task of ensur russia s gener safeti and secur it is obviou that in order to organ a singl econom area it will becom necessari to solv the question of border regim both between ci state and along the former soviet union s perimet unless thi is done it will be imposs to avoid econom sabotag close the extern border otherwis the russian feder s border will also be penetr halt the rise of crime and especi of organ crime and so on the most vulner sector of the russian feder s border li in the region of interethn conflict it is therefor in our nation interest to extinguish all interethn conflict along the caucasian

be disadvantag for russia to becom the first to introduc arm protect of border with ci countri it would therefor be expedi to begin with a gener accord on border regim what will be the natur of border the extent to which arm forc will particip in their protect and so on it would be expedi if the new state were to us their own forc to protect their border thi appli especi to the southern border thi section of the border ha been close in russia s interest but it is unfair for russia alon to bear the respons and cost it is in the ci state nation interest to receiv guarante against nuclear attack the likelihood of which ha to be taken into consider in todai s world the russian feder is in a posit to back up such guarante at the same time howev we ar interest in have all ci state join the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the nuclear power todai ar interest in strengthen the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon and rule out ani access to them for adventurist and irrespons politician furthermor joint action by all nuclear power in thi sphere promot the develop of relat of trust between them which is also in line with the russian feder s interest 4 threat to the preserv of state stabil and secur measur for their neutral the idea of superpow statu base upon unrestrain militar wa the primari caus of the soviet union s defeat in the cold war and it subsequ collaps the russian feder s return to such a polici would pose the greatest threat to it statehood and secur as for the extern threat it natur ha chang wherea previous the arm threat origin primarili from the west there is no worri origin from thi direct at present at the same time it would be prematur to rule out militari danger from the southwest in the event of ani protract of the arm conflict in yugoslavia capabl of involv neighbor countri the conflict s religi aspect is especi danger becaus we ar talk about three faith with adher in mani countri includ the russian feder romania could also produc a seat of tension or rather an outburst of romanian great power chauvin which ha not abandon the idea of re creat a greater romania incorpor moldova and the dniester region land should thi happen ani such

region adjoin the caucasian and central asian ci state islam fundament compris mighti forc and in todai s situat it nurtur the hope of creat a bloc of islam state under the auspic of pakistan iran and less like turkei such a bloc will inevit try to includ in it orbit azerbaijan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan it cannot be rule out that it might attempt to influenc kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan as well when evalu thi danger it is necessari to take into account the chang natur of mutual relat within the triangl of the russian feder the arab countri and israel the normal of the russian feder s relat with israel and the latter s susten through emigr from russia coupl with the fact that the russian feder ha to a certain extent distanc itself from libya and iraq ar provid ground for grow anti

come to abandon propaganda declar like the complet ban and withdraw of nuclear weapon and to take a realist point of view a certain quantiti of nuclear potenti is a guarante of secur both for the russian feder and the ci state in addit it is necessari to aim both now and in the forese futur for a ration regul of the balanc of the nuclear missil potenti of russia the unit state britain franc

take into account the object reduct of the role plai by militari strength as the main instrument for protect russia s nation interest the foremost task now is to creat a system of collect respons by

thi fact it is necessari for the unit nation and the intern commun to give russia s peacemak forc a mandat to oper in the region s conflict zone under un auspic and with the statu of blue helmet on of russia s most import foreign polici object is it particip in the strengthen of eurasian secur russia cannot accept the tendenc toward nato expans via the admiss of east european countri to the bloc thi approach is akin to the build of a new movabl berlin wall thi would requir the solut of mani question both pure militari and econom the strateg group of russia s troop in the west now is such that

process could be the conven on russia s initi of the first asia pacif interparliamentari confer in for exampl vladivostok two specif initi ar propos to hold talk to defin quota for the arm trade and to creat a perman confer of arm export countri within the framework of a new intern organ to be set up in the place of cocom coordin committe for multilater export control there is full justif for

mainten of intern ecolog secur two main trend domin the west s polici at present a to us all possibl mean to push russia into copi the western primarili the us model regardless of ani consequ for the countri and the popul b to prevent russia from take full advantag of the west s modern technolog achiev and drive it mainli toward the product of raw materi fuel and semimanufactur in other word to sink the countri in backward in the third world mani peopl believ that ani expect that the west and the unit state will help the reviv of a mighti and independ russia ar at best naiv the west is increasingli lose it interest in us becaus first we have lost our former econom and militari strength and second we ar no longer claim to be creat a social altern to the west at the same time as can be seen from b clinton s speech in the long term and by attract resourc for it modern from germani and japan and possibl from franc itali and britain russia could weaken competit between the western power in the econom sphere it is also worth note the question of reviv the bipolar system but on a complet new basi the idea of form a second pole is certainli not the product of abstract imagin or a specul project the shortcom and danger of the monopolar system make it necessari to consid the altern idea of a second pole the us monopoli as the sole world leader could tragic destabil intern relat by it veri natur the bipolar system offer a more stabl basi for cooper between the center of world polit it will enabl the third world countri china and russia to protect their common and individu interest in a more or less organ wai and consequ to guarante the greater effect of their effort the creation of a second pole could also strengthen militari polit stabil in the countri adjoin it and could becom an instrument for settl conflict without the west s interfer a seriou motiv for thi could be provid by the need to protect nation cultur asset to counter the expans of western mass cultur and at the same time to pool effort for the shape of competit nation cultur on the basi of the peopl own vital valu and the renew of their tradit equal collabor between all cultur could serv as a counterweight to the hegemoni of western mass cultur which is be implant final a substanti justif for form a second pole is provid by the quest for a new type of civil to replac the domin industri capitalist on whose exhaust and crisi ar increasingli obviou and univers recogn thi object could attract sympathi for the second pole among mani progress stream in the west which ar concern with the quest for a new wai of life collabor between the two center would most probabl lead to posit chang in the natur and content of the first pole s activ and give it a more realist orient even the actual discuss of the problem of creat a second pole could lead to favor albeit partial posit chang in our opinion bipolar will acceler the process of form a global system on the basi of the balanc of interest and becom a step in that direct all of mankind includ the atlant center is interest in creat the second pole becaus it offer a program for extric from the crisi be experienc by the whole world although the second pole is need partli as a counterweight to the first their relat need not be antagonist but could be built on the principl of cooper includ cooper between the unit state and russia a return to the bipolar model of the world is not the onli possibl option the multipolar system also ha it advantag in ani case it is import to ensur that thi system guarante stabil and russia occupi in it a posit befit the statu of a great power 5 disarma problem russia did not inherit ani militari polit alli from the ussr it is object unabl to maintain the mighti arm forc which the soviet union had in mani direct the paramet of russia s defens were move far beyond the limit of it state border now the countri either ha no such paramet or thei have end up be unusu close to it central region the end of the great confront between the two superpow did not lead to the triumph of the principl of nonus of forc in intern affair as proclaim by the unit nation or to the disband of militari polit allianc creat or so the explan went to parri the soviet militari threat moreov the sole remain superpow displai a notic stronger desir to impos it will wherev it feel that us interest exist includ the baltic countri there is no need to explain that if russia intend to solv it own problem guid by it own nation interest it must be strong in everi respect includ by no mean least in defens question we have the full potenti to do so thi doe not run counter to the long term peacemak guidelin proclaim by russia s presid in hi januari 1992 messag to the un secretari gener the principl of effect global and region militari polit stabil declar in thi messag also presuppos measur for mutual disarma thi is precis why russia offici took over from the ussr the baton of reduc the militari potenti of state and eas the level of intern tension it confirm the commit under intern treati and agreement to which the soviet side wa a parti and also sign in januari 1993 the russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start ii thu the track taken by russia in the sphere of the disarma process is in line with the on which the ussr follow dure the last year of it exist but the differ militari strateg condit in which russia now find itself demand of it the elabor of new concept and approach toward the solut of problem concern the arm limit and reduct nuclear disarma problem the salt i and salt ii soviet us agreement in the strateg arm limit sphere were underpin by the principl of equal and ident secur which wa agre by the side it main criterion wa the ensur of militari strateg equilibrium thi in the side opinion not onli coincid with the secur interest of the partner in the talk but also promot the stabil of the world situat but the last soviet us treati on the reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start i contain provis make it possibl to bypass thi principl if necessari the treati s shortcom includ not onli the univers known notion count of weapon which total negat the side initi proclaim intent to reduc their strateg potenti by on half but also a seri of provis place the side in unequ condit for exampl the treati impos stricter limit on land base icbm which have tradition been the foundat of the ussr and now of russia s strateg might at the same time the most liber interpret ha been appli to reduct requir for heavi bomber in which the unit state enjoi a threefold advantag there is absolut no justif for exclud from the treati s effect the strateg sea launch cruis missil which ar object more advantag for the unit state the soviet side simpli fail to obtain agreement from it partner at the talk that the abm treati should be observ while the start i treati is in forc consequ the unit state retain the possibl to chang the strateg potenti to it advantag by implement the sdi program the start i treati ha still not come into forc despit thi a new now russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens weapon start ii wa sign in januari 1993 follow compar brief talk but thi treai is not flawless suffic it to mention it provis on the procedur for the convers of icbm and submarin launch ballist missil from multipl warhead to singl warhead and the reorient of 100 us heavi bomber for the perform of nonnuclear task the start ii treati s provis potenti offer the us side an opportun to re instal more than 4 500 nuclear warhead on strateg deliveri platform within the briefest of time frame bear in mind that the total number of nuclear warhead the side mai hold after the reduct should not exce 3 000 3 500 unit russia run the risk of find itself in a situat wherebi the unit state have for some reason denounc the start ii treati could veri quickli doubl it strateg nuclear potenti under the term of the treati russia should it wish to do the same would not be abl to boost it potenti by more than 900 unit the same wai nonetheless russia ha ratifi the start i treati and ha express redi to ratifi the start ii treati with all their shortcom and posit aspect at the same time it is perfectli clear that the process of the limit and reduct of strateg arm will be continu at some stage it will be join by other nuclear power on what basi should these talk be conduct what should be their ultim goal the question of complet elimin of nuclear weapon will hardli be rais in the forese futur the other nuclear power ar not rais thi task even as an idea the agenda will evid includ the question of arriv at some maximum level for strateg nuclear arm to correspond with the so call minimum nuclear deterr back in the past the ussr express readi to support thi idea and to discuss and agre it strateg mean and basic criteria it might possibl be us to repeat thi attempt nevertheless regardless of whether thi concept will be discuss on a multilater or bilater with the unit state basi russia will have to determin what in it militari strateg posit should be meant by minimum nuclear deterr and thi should be the subsequ guid principl when elabor posit for talk on strateg nuclear arm and on nuclear arm in gener thi will help prevent ani reduct of russian nuclear forc below a certain critic limit it would not go amiss to also apprais the extent to which thi criterion correspond with the start i and start ii treati when accpt the concept of minimum nuclear deterr at the talk it is necessari to bear in mind that thi decis will inevit necessit the examin either in parallel or jointli with strateg nuclear arm of the question of tactic nuclear arm especi if thei ar deploi so as to reach target on the other side s territori includ ship base weapon as well as the uncondit observ of the abm treati limit of convent arm forc and their armament the consist process of disarma must certainli becom the normal polici of ani peacelov state in the post confront period furthermor the outbreak of interethn and other region conflict testifi that the reduct of the potenti of convent arm forc and armament is a task as import as that of reduc strateg and tactic nuclear potenti the continu of talk on convent arm forc and armament is especi topic for russia it is necessari not onli becaus it is becom increasingli difficult to man and maintain such larg arm forc but also becaus we will have to honor committ under the 1990 treati on convent arm forc in europ the parti to which wa the soviet union and not russia thi is not the same thing therefor strictli speak follow the disappear from the militari polit arena of on of the collect parti to the treati the wpo and later on of the ussr new talk ought to be held on the reduct of convent arm forc in europ and a new accord ought to be reach take into account the sharp chang in the situat in thi import region of the planet on 8 juli 1992 russia ratifi the treati under which it also commit itself to the stage by stage reduct of the numer strength of it armi and navi from 2 8 million to 2 1 million men by 1995 and to 1 5 million men by the year 2000 at the same time the nato state did not embark on ani limit and reduct of the numer strength of their arm forc and firmli refus to take naval forc on of the most import compon into account when determin the militari strateg balanc enjoi undisput superior in naval armament capabl of deliv strike against land base target carrier born aviat sea launch cruis missil nato wa unwil to lose thi imbal thi posit is most typic of the entir western approach toward talk on the limit of convent arm forc in europ it envisag the elimin of imbal but onli in those categori of armament where the wpo enjoi the advantag it is clear that ani potenti futur talk cannot leav the question of naval armament outsid the scope of agreement especi as regard armament design to strike against land base target the veri fact of the accept of commit under an accord elabor for anoth state the ussr and for differ militari strateg condit realli goe beyond the framework of ordinari common sens which indic that russia ought to accept and honor onli commit which have been thoroughli and specif elabor for the russian condit otherwis the situat mai reach the point of absurd as it did in 1993 dure the withdraw of troop from germani and the attempt to deploi them in the north caucasu militari district it emerg that russia could not do thi without breach sever provis of the treati it had ratifi it also emerg that russia cannot show ani concern for it southern flank as it see fit sinc it is constrain by limit under thi treati much ha been and is be said about the principl of suffici there is hardli a singl state in the world which would declar that the militari organiz develop of it arm forc is guid by the principl of insuffici or supersuffici therefor the term of simpl suffici is meaningless the term defens suffici or suffici for defens would be more appropri to the concept of russia s defens polici but the mean of even thi term demand thorough elabor onli when thi term ha been given specif content in line with the russian state s militari doctrin it can and must provid the basi of posit for subsequ talk on arm limit 6 the need to improv the mechan for manag militari organiz develop ani polit program of the leadership need a finetun mechan for their implement otherwis thei will remain noth but wish think in the sphere of militari work we ar still nurtur the illus that we ar talk onli of a partial reduct of the arm forc and a partial switch of the militari economi to the manufactur of nation econom output and that the actual mechan for manag militari organiz develop can remain basic the same fundament document in the defens sphere ar be implement with difficulti there is no doubt that the basic provis of the militari doctrin will creat the necessari prerequisit for the organiz develop of de facto new arm forc for russia for the reliabl protect of it interest for the elabor of long term militari technic polici for the creation and further develop of qualit new forc and for the train and educ of the personnel the militari doctrin approv by the presid basic ensur that russia will honor it intern commit on the reduct of armament and arm forc and the mainten of peac the specif applic of the militari doctrin in the sphere of the militari economi is defin in the presid s special edict no 1850 of 11 novemb 1992 wherea onli certain clarifi remark can be made as regard the doctrin s militari and militari technic aspect there ar doubt aris as regard the econom mechan thi is becaus attempt ar be made to retain the old method of manag and adapt them to the complet differ socioeconom condit now develop in russia under the former administr edict system of manag when all element of the econom organ were not onli subordin to the state but also belong to it the main mechan of manag were program and plan five year annual and so on the plan ratif wa follow by the implement of the principl that the plan is law and must be fulfil at all cost at time it wa wreck more often than not it wa fulfil but the mechan function now the situat ha chang radic complet differ law oper in the market economi even the law on defens adopt in 1992 enshrin that the state order in other word the plan issu from abov call for mandatori fulfil onli in wartim financi and econom incent should be us in peacetim the budget and the taxat system becom the main instrument of manag it is therefor anachronist for the militari doctrin in it section on militari technic and econom foundat to reli on elabor and implement of long term up to 10 15 year program for armament and militari equip on the basi of state defens order financ by the state attent must mainli be given to a comprehens substanti and balanc defens budget it is the budget that bring togeth the contradictori interest of variou depart involv in the solut of task concern the countri s defens suffic it to recal the august septemb 1993 outburst of passion surround the budget at the highest level in russia thi is why the budget need independ expert apprais it will help the practic implement of the doctrin s militari polit provis and it is through the budget that civilian control will be exercis over the activ of the power depart thi is why repres of variou nonstat institut advoc a public discuss of the defens budget comprehens control and prompt account for it fuilfil the basic provis of the militari doctrin also contain other weak point which prompt critic by the opposit inde a seri of provis need clarif and amend to the extent that life and russia s militari strateg situat will chang challeng and potenti histori s main lesson is that we won world war ii but lost the leadership race which is run accord to econom rule have lost it superpow statu russia slid headlong to the rank of develop countri and now even of regress countri for the first time in the last 40 year we ar not threaten by the perman danger of global militari conflict but the domest instabl the chao the devast in the economi and the mental of loser pose an equal threat to nation secur the fundament new polit realiti of which our countri s citizen ar becom painfulli awar is that for the first time throughout it thousand year histori russia ha becom a depend countri it depend at least on foreign creditor the dollar rubl rate of exchang foreign aid and invest import deliveri and raw materi price on the world market the russian feder s foreign polici is no longer fulli autonom intern bank and agreement ar larg try to dictat even our domest polici we ar virtual without alli in the world on the other hand there ar fewer extern enemi too russia ha join the system of multipolar coordin of intern secur the situat is significantli wors within the area of the former ussr interethn conflict have flare along the border the former militari polit and econom allianc and institut have been destroi new on have either not been creat or ar not function the nation pride of great russian ha been denigr the choic that societi and the state now have to make is not free either todai we have to choos from a veri limit number of option either russia will remain a fulli depend countri or it will remain partial depend or russia will strive for full independ have decid thi crucial issu for ourselv we will be abl to choos the sole scenario for the further develop of event it appear that onli the second option is the most realist it presuppos develop base mainli on relianc on our own strength but with a high degre of extern aid but our futur freedom in decisionmak will be limit in proport with the degre of depend to paraphras w churchil s famou sentenc it can be said about russia that we no longer have ani friend we have onli partner whether we like it or not thi world is base on respect for the strength of author and the might of the state unfortun we cannot expect the former respect without have the former might consequ the most import task of russia s leadership over the next few year is to restructur the economi modern fix product asset and reduc the energi and materi intens of product the econom financi polit and militari might can be boost onli on thi basi onli a program for steadi econom growth over the next 10 15 year can ensur signific progress in the russian economi s success reform democraci is fragil all countri that have travers the long path of nurtur genuin democraci know that a young democraci unless it is legal econom and sociopolit protect is as a rule doom to degener thi is the mortal danger at present all thi is aggrav by the fact that the new structur of life we ar build in russia is still far awai from genuin divers the social base of reform remain narrow the shape of a genuin middl class the foundat of futur stabil took the wrong path from the veri begin the restor of our domest viabil in the sphere of product invest technolog educ and energi is the most import task for ensur both domest and extern secur stabil and independ thi is the basi on which the new nationwid ideolog should be formul the govern local administr and feder assembl deputi must realiz we ar live in a chang and chang world the independ state economi can no longer remain strictli nation differ between domest and foreign polici ar fade in our relat with ci state it is import to convincingli demonstr the role of destruct econom nation and cooper with them in the quest for peac wai to resolv ethnic crise threaten stabil in russia europ and the world it is also necessari to be awar that have fail to organ our own effici product of competit good we ar forc to import them from abroad thu creat addit job over there rather than at home and doom our own worker to unemploy and poverti the opposit also appli thi is why the major of social problem and crise in 1994 will be associ with the economi and with domest and foreign polici the realiz of thi is alreadi halfwai to solut and the adopt of correct decis is halfwai to success the other half will be determin by russia s citizen their mood new incent for labor disciplin and entrepreneurship respect for the law and faith in reform hundr of correct law mai be promulg the world s best constitut mai be adopt but we will not extric ourselv from the system s crisi unless man feel the need to live and work better the central problem in 1994 is to restor the prestig of state power and creat an effect mechan for the law oper and for monitor the fulfil of adopt decis nation secur begin with reliabl protect of russia s citizen against ani attack and infring it is necessari to radic review the attitud toward thi

we will have to solv the budget deficit problem curb inflat strengthen the regim of save and increas capit invest we also need a taxat system and a legisl system capabl of boost product rather than

countri is the presid will to give out that inform gaviria more than that i have given instruct for the defens ministri to give out all the inform it ha on the temporari presenc of us troop in the countri the govern is will as it ha alwai been to fulli cooper with the council of state not onli by turn over document but also by make the necessari explan to clear up thi matter el tiempo as for the presenc of us troop in juanchaco why did the govern not ask the senat or the council of state for author as the nation constitut requir gaviria it is clear that the govern believ the presenc of us troop or those of other countri that enter colombian territori to provid technic and train assist and that observ intern agreement doe not violat the constitut the legal base for thi type of exercis is the inter american reciproc assist treati tiar which is current in effect it wa sign by colombia and approv by the congress of the republ in 1947 thi treati wa follow by the mutual defens assist agreement sign on 17 april 1952 these type of militari mission ar carri out in colombia base on legal document that have been in effect sinc the middl of the centuri as for the joint militari engin exercis take place in juanchaco in which neither militari personnel as publish nor warship ar particip there is a memorandum of understand and an agreement sign by defens minist rafael pardo and us ambassador morri busbi on 29 octob 1993 these instrument lie within the framework of among other the tiar thei specifi that the mission will be joint militari engin exercis for train purpos which will lead to the construct of variou project for commun us other similar agreement exist on of them ha to do with the exchang of militari personnel anoth ha to do with the integr of the radar network locat in the caribbean and anoth is aim at expand the naval river fleet moreov within the same framework of the tiar there have been variou joint exercis with militari unit from variou latin american countri we can mention the well known naval oper call unita 34 of which have alreadi been held thei have been held everi year sinc 1959 in colombian territori water as well as in other countri naval unit from variou countri ar train with regard to the joint procedur that would be follow in case of an attack from outsid the contin a land exercis ha taken place each year sinc 1962 at a place known as la cangrejera on the atlant coast in 1983 two exercis took place on in tumaco and anoth in san andr in 1991 and 1992 exercis took place in the vicin of the bahia malaga naval base thei were joint exercis with the particip of us and colombian soldier among other therefor by virtu of the fact that at the time tiar wa approv by the congress the defens ministri and all exercis have been carri out on these same legal assumpt and never ha anyon object i do not consid it necessari to request author from the senat or request the opinion of the council of state or inform ani other author the same wai it wa not done in the past with unita and other similar exercis el tiempo but do you believ mr presid that the countri is so naiv as to believ that 150 men from the unit state ar need to build a small school gaviria of cours not all these project can be done by the colombian state but here li the mistak these gentlemen ar militari engin and have come here to carri out joint exercis with colombian militari forc the idea is to teach and practic to share technic experi to solv logist and commun problem which eventu our men would meet in a situat of war instead of expend energi build or make useless thing thei dedic their energi to civic and solidar object the idea is to take advantag of the joint militari engin train and at the same time benefit the area and the commun el tiempo doe the presenc of us soldier in juanchaco violat colombian sovereignti gaviria the presid doe not see it that wai the us militari engin ar in an area total under the control of the colombian navi and carri out their work under the supervis of the arm forc i must also insist that the presenc of militari mission do civilian work is cover by intern agreement that ar current in forc the problem is that mani stori have been weav around thi in fact the el tiempo sundai edit highlight the li that have been us to attack the peopl s good faith i have even heard that a us base will be built in juanchaco to replac the on in panama or wors yet that a new transocean canal is be design good graciou on need to be veri naiv or veri ill intent to spread stori such as these that make no sens all thi uproar lead me to wonder that onc studi ar complet which both the council of state and the prosecutor gener s offic ar do the countri must reflect and decid whether or not it want thi type of assist in the futur my person opinion is that if on believ that thi type of assist is an affront to our sovereignti on is close the door on someth that is basic to make our arm forc more profession not onli that but we would end cooper equip suppli mainten and intellig that allow us to fight crime el tiempo presid but juanchaco is not the onli case what were the us plane that overflew barranquilla thi weekend up to gaviria accord to what the militari forc gener command and the fac colombian air forc report to me the weekend barranquilla overflight had been legal author earlier the civil aeronaut board through the director of air oper had inform on the atlant coast area that thi type of aircraft wa go to overfli colombia in it fight against drug traffick receiv support from the unit state and other countri we do not have all the equip or the requir technolog to support with technic intellig the struggl against drug traffick on the basi of current agreement that seek to repress illeg drug traffick the defens ministri request when condit warrant the support of us plane that ar special equip to detect airplan that have not file a flight plan it is worth mention that overflight by us airplan ar author by decre no 1692 of 1992 the overflight ar to inform the colombian author on the presenc of unauthor plane and that ani other measur such as chase these airplan is exclus the respons of the fac and other nation author you might be ask yourselv why the air traffic control did not know becaus there ar ongo investig of air control involv in drug traffick there ar also peopl who ar interest in stir up fals sovereignti debat encourag by a dark sponsor if we ar concern about defend our air space sovereignti the true threat doe not lie in joint oper with the help of friendli countri danger to sovereignti to colombian societi and air secur aris with the hundr of illeg flight without flight plan and with pervers motiv carri out by gun runner and drug traffick over our territori the author overflight ar precis an act of sovereignti to prevent our air space from be us with impun by colombia s true enemi el tiempo how mani air surveil radar ha the unit state

do you still feel that wai gaviria to be precis i would be more accur to talk of it as a solidar or civic oper i feel that build a hospit or a school like the us militari engin ar do as a by product of the joint exercis is a task that entail goodwil and as the juanchaco resid have said it benefit the peopl of the zone where it occur el tiempo is there ani relat between the war against the cali cartel and the juanchaco oper do the militari oper in juanchaco includ build and oper radio beacon that seek to control drug traffick gaviria i believ i have state with suffici clariti that the juanchaco activ which stem from the memoranda of agreement and understand sign between defens minist rafael pardo and us ambassador busbi have no other purpos than the on announc the joint implement of militari engin project base on reciproc assist treati moreov in view of the evid need of the peopl of that area of the countri the defens ministri and the vall depart governor s offic sign a

no connect with the project the us soldier ar implement all of thi fall within the framework of the colombian constitut and law some peopl who ar doubt have legitim concern other who vehement defend the notion of a us invas ar espous a fals nation that come from bad inform or shadi interest el tiempo why have there been so mani contradict so much secreci so much mysteri in the handl of thi case gaviria no there ha not been ani of that from the start i report the activ go on in juanchaco if you compar the inform the govern issu in decemb to current inform it is exactli the same the public is awar of the scope of the oper arm forc offic have been readi to speak with report and some report have even visit the site as i said i think it is legitim that doubt and question ar express at polit and public opinion level and the govern ha the oblig to answer them i also think howev the countri is the victim of an exacerb and ill intend distort of event i am not rule out the exist of a misinform campaign aim at creat sentiment against intern cooper in the struggl against drug traffick in the past drug traffick have manipul a fals sens of nation to undermin the nation s purpos of rid

regard your question the countri know we ar studi the topic either through consult between presid or contact the foreign minist ha made we will make a decis at an opportun time a decis will respond to the interest of colombia and america concern the privat convers between the prosecutor gener and ms reno i must inform you that the inform i have is quit differ from that publish in the weekli in question never for exampl wa there ani mention of the word pardon a pardon is a moral and legal imposs of which neither the presid nor the prosecutor could approv under ani circumst for obviou reason the presid of the republ cannot expand on the issu discuss in that privat meet but he is convinc that the term of the convers differ from the report that were publish what must be stress is that after that convers prosecutor gener de greiff and the us justic depart manag to settl most of the differ that had emerg dure the process of legal cooper wherebi the proof gather in the unit state against drug traffick wa collect for the colombian court nevertheless becaus i am alreadi discuss thi topic allow me to tell you that the presid of the republ ha a high opinion of the prosecutor gener who ha becom on of the moral pillar of our societi with hi legal wisdom and administr skill he ha built the prosecutor gener s offic which wa creat by the 1991 constitut to establish system of litig in our countri moreov he ha done much more than thi he ha brave confront the threat of crimin who see in the prosecutor gener a respres of colombian who refus to allow themselv to be defeat and were not frighten by the onslaught of violenc the prosecutor work shoulder to shoulder with the presid of the republ and hi staff to develop and consolid polici such as the polici of submiss to justic which ha allow a tangibl reduct of the terrorist phenomena associ with drug traffick more recent the prosecutor ha made progress in bring to trial sentenc and jail sever crimin of cours there have been time when we held differ point of view in short differ opinion concern the wai to handl particular case becaus of the good relationship that exist between the presid and the prosecutor and becaus of the

to a top secur jail also if he want to obtain from the govern the implicit benefit of the submiss polici he must cooper with the author and confess el tiempo the wai these drug traffick ar be held in custodi seem to be on of the reason for disagr to what extent is the govern s sever due to what could be describ as la catedr syndrom refer to envigado maximum secur prison in medellin also known as la catedr consid to be on of the most secur prison in latin america gaviria the govern ha learn from past experi good and bad in turn the govern must make sure that member of societi who surrend to

not import for the govern to dismantl a busi whose profit can run in the million and the countri s most complex crimin organ gaviria it is the duti of thi govern the prosecutor gener s offic and the attornei gener s offic to find a good judici solut to break impun and to have the leader of crimin organ cooper with justic go to prison and serv sentenc that serv as deterr if in addit their illeg

extremist fundamentalist group from sever arab and islam countri whose activ and distribut were prepar and coordin to be a major financi resourc for pan fundament and so thi network aim at europ through iran and thenc to turkei and bulgaria from there thei divid up among the countri of the former eastern bloc and western europ especi holland germani franc and itali french statist show that 70 percent of the heroin come from afghanistan pakistan and iran with the collaps of the soviet union the golden crescent network expand into these new countri and cooper with the republ of central asia which in recent time have experienc an explos in the cultiv of drug with the cooper of the golden crescent s expert cooper with the mafia intern report confirm that the global fundamentalist drug network ha succeed in penetr market by close cooper with the intern mafia that have histor control them agreement were sign with the famou sicilian cosa nostra with mani russian mafia and the local

network introduc the extremist to secret and formerli unknown rout through which thei ar abl to infiltr thi or that countri and which also suppli them with secret refug to which to escap from the

the fundamentalist network these market were open to fund the extremist islam movement activ in africa which ar base in sudan even more danger is the fact that the global fundamentalist fund network doe not confin it activ to wholesal but focus on control the drug traffick market with half wholesal and retail numer secur bureau in western europ meet in thi phenomenon which wa recent discov while follow and intens monitor the movement of the extremist islam network in some european countri french intellig discov that drug traffick plai a major role in fund algerian fi cell and those of the tunisian ennahdah movement on it soil thei saw that there ar complex and close coordin and organ network control by tunisian and algerian thei have their own pakistani suppli network special in smuggl heroin into europ through iran the french secur agenc had previous discov in investig the background of the social and athlet club control by fundamentalist and pursu drug dealer that the true aim wa not protect arab and muslim immigr from thi plagu but control the market the agenc notic that some fi member and some of the north african fundamentalist who sell smuggl and stolen good in the thiev market in pari soon turn to sell drug as it give them a bigger profit thu the share taken out to fund the algerian fundamentalist is bigger in germani belgium and holland the turkish network link to the fundamentalist network is in control in most of the other european countri thi phenomenon ha been clearli notic recent without secur agenc be abl alwai to determin the link between the drug dealer and fundamentalist extremist hekmatyar the new leader some report go so far as to speak of a highli organ and prepar global fundamentalist network assign the task of all stage from drug smuggl to distribut by wai of barter them for arm and smuggl them to network special in monei launder in sever foreign bank in the caribbean island the british isl europ and some countri of latin america as well as bank in lo angel montreal luxembourg switzerland itali hungari poland and russia the inform add that everi major fundamentalist movement activ todai in thi or that arab or islam countri ha a repres in charg of fund oper secur monei and arm and link to the leadership of thi global network in the area under hekmatyar s influenc in afghanistan it appear that thi network ha been abl to attract more islam faction than iran especi those that declin to announc their obedi to the islam republ prefer to maintain their independ and their ideolog oppos to shiit fundamentalist hegemoni for thi reason expert todai agre that the primari leader of the new pan islam is not khamen i nor even hasan al turabi but golboddin hekmatyar the main overs of the drug trade in the golden crescent and henc the main backer and maestro of the extremist fundamentalist movement in the view of these expert the reason that leader of the global islam movement flock to afghanistan like hasan al turabi rachid ghannouchi and other is to coordin with the new leader and seek hi favor observ sai that the recent war hekmatyar wage against the group of presid rabbani and ahmad shah ma ud with the cooper of former american as publish communist dostam wa part of hi new plan to take power in afghanistan and proclaim it an islam republ and the main base and refug for extremist fundamentalist movement for year hekmatyar s region ha been a refug for the afghan arab and extremist flee their countri sinc benazir bhutto assum power in pakistan and announc her intent to expel the afghan arab from peshawar jalalabad ha becom the major altern sanctuari for the afghan and extremist a gather center for their leader such as egyptian shawqi al islambuli and algerian kamreddin kherban and abdallah ana and the major plan and fund site for terrorist oper in the arab and islam countri it is noteworthi that some religi group tri in the begin to critic islamist for resort to thi method of fund especi as drug ar prohibit in islam not onli their sale but their cultiv product consumpt and storag so much for the al turabi hekmatyar theori which ha spread through the rank of the fundamentalist that justifi thi trade on the basi of wage war against the west and the strategi of fragment it societi thi is what is gener claim by some islam drug dealer in the street of pari rome or bonn thei sai that thei sell onli to white more danger is that the promot of thi trade on a wide scale ha led to the transform of third world countri among them islam countri from produc to consum countri it is noteworthi that afghanistan and pakistan have both becom big consum of drug as well as other islam and arab countri that have recent experienc an increas in drug smuggl activ there wa also a strategi to corrupt arab and muslim societi it ha alreadi reach the point where some leader of islam group have issu religi rule legitim drug smuggl and us as a mean of mobil fighter to undertak suicid oper thi wa seen in the lebanes war but with the militia of all side now it is seen in the suicid oper of some extremist in algeria where more than on report ha reveal the fact that fighter were addict to drug befor thei took on danger attack in ani case drug traffick is not the onli forbidden sin commit by the extremist it seem that the call of shaykh abdelbaki sahraoui imam of the khalid ibn walid mosqu in pari and co founder of fi fell on deaf ear when he attack those islamist in a sermon and ask them to stop traffick in smuggl good he reaffirm that thi wa illegitim and forbidden thei would be better off sell flower as on muslim clergyman said is it not also forbidden for a muslim to kill hi muslim brother but it appear that the extremist fundamentalist new logic is that the end justifi the mean the mean that thei recent us secur them fund that is compar to the budget of some rich countri that is more import to them even if thei undertak the biggest defam of the imag of islam by build mafia style smuggl network hide behind islam valu without ani of their member dare to oppos or question the health of their call or their credibl

august it is insist on make chang what ar the chang made in your ministri quiroga there ar three basic aspect we want to chang in the transit from the old interior ministri to the new govern ministri the first is relat to the intellig servic which terrifi the peopl thi wa the part of the state that investig the possibl of a coup of sedit but we now believ that under a modern and establish democraci like our these servic must contribut to peopl s secur and along with it basic organ which is the polic should support bolivian and give them daili secur we ar work on it the first step taken is to institution the intellig servic and put them in the hand of the polic in order to prevent them from becom an instrument of the polit power that happen to be in charg of the govern ministri canipa is there no longer a govern ministri intellig servic quiroga there is an intellig servic in the govern ministri that depend on the polic and all it member ar part of the bolivian polic thi is close link to the chang in the polic as part of the first aspect passag omit canipa what will happen with the struggl against drug traffick will it be includ in these chang quiroga of cours to start with we have chang the social defens secretariat which onc wa exclus link to the issu of coca and cocain it now ha a wider role involv prevent and interdict although interdict had been an import role we believ altern develop is also an essenti issu it will not be possibl to achiev an adequ replac for surplu coca product if we ar not abl to find an econom solut the onli wai that an individu who grow coca stop do it is when he realiz that grow anoth product is more profit than grow coca from the econom point of view thi is what we ar work on we have taken control of the fund for altern develop by chang it structur we creat an execut board presid over by a deleg of the presid of the republ and it respons is share by the execut branch and coca produc we would like to see the execut board creat the idea to carri out altern develop erad will be link to altern develop in those place where erad is be carri out there will be altern develop and where altern develop took place it wa becaus there wa a reduct in coca grow but i am not sai that we will elimin interdict we will continu the work be carri out in the countri but interdict will be exclus against drug traffick not against coca grower or peopl involv in the legal commerci of coca we have a special antinarcot forc felcn that is an exampl for latin america and we will continu to support it becaus we believ that interdict is essenti we also will carri out prevent as an overal part of our strategi and thi is why we creat the social prevent under secretariat which will deal with alcohol drug addict and crime thi organ will help try to prevent these evil in societi through teach program canipa to talk about success and real altern develop not just in speech the wai it is now mean talk about resourc how will you financ the altern develop project to becom a realiti quiroga we ar talk about three basic sourc of financ the first is the resourc that drug traffick itself produc the countri ha mani resourc from drug traffick that ar lost with time we ar talk about a great deal of monei mani asset that have been disappear the on respons wa first the interior ministri later it wa a share respons between prosecutor and the interior ministri now it is the respons of prosecutor and the judg who hand over the asset to truste who later disappear we will propos that the legisl branch chang the law to be abl to immedi auction confisc asset to creat a common fund to support the peopl found innoc after their asset were confisc with thi fund we hope to financ 30 to 35 percent of the altern develop program the second resourc will be multin organ the unit nation and the inter american develop bank ar interest in carri out altern develop program under the concept that the onli wai to do it adequ is through the industri of the area where surplu coca is grown the third financ resourc is the unit state with bilater aid that countri gave about 20 million to 25 million annual for altern develop but a larg part of those resourc were us to pai salari and not necessarili to carri out altern develop with these three resourc which ar not from the nation treasuri in addit to some fund from the nation budget we believ we can carri out a good altern develop polici canipa regard interdict there ha been a great deal of talk about the presenc of colombian drug traffick in bolivia is that true quiroga we have inform about new technolog the technolog us in the countri is differ from that us by the medellin and cali cartel but in the last two year we have seen that the technolog to produc coca and cocain in the countri ha quickli improv and thi make the narcot intellig organ think there is perman and decis cooper by the colombian drug cartel anoth aspect is that probabl 80 percent of the drug produc in the countri goe to colombia whether it goe to paraguai argentina or brazil it final destin is colombia where the last stage of purif is made befor it is sent to the unit state perhap thi is the most import reason to continu with interdict to prevent colombian drug traffick from establish themselv in our countri canipa doe thi repres a threat of violenc quiroga without a doubt thi mai repres violenc becaus the mafia is violent and we will not send nun from a convent to fight against them we must send outstand offic against them becaus thi is a war a war in which the govern the polic have to fulfil the law when the other side violat them drug traffick violat sovereignti hurt the popul by threaten them and also murder with impun it is an unjust struggl becaus on side ha law and regul to fulfil while the other side ha absolut no restrict canipa do you have a list of the main drug traffick in the countri who head the list quiroga we have a perman list that undergo chang base on arrest the number on in the countri is meco dominguez who wa sentenc but later escap he is at larg there is also a list of nine individu who ar a number on prioriti for felcn onli two month ago the number on on that list wa nando gutierrez who wa captur as you can see it is a list that chang period we have a felcn that is veri effici but the dea cooper in thi work must be

is the inter american reciproc assist treati tiar which is current in effect it wa sign by colombia and approv by the congress of the republ in 1947 thi treati wa follow by the mutual defens assist agreement sign on 17 april 1952 these type of militari mission ar carri out in colombia base on legal document that have been in effect sinc the middl of the centuri as for the joint militari engin exercis take place in juanchaco in which neither militari personnel as publish nor warship ar particip there is a memorandum of understand and an agreement sign by defens minist rafael pardo and us ambassador morri busbi on 29 octob 1993 these instrument lie within the framework of among other the tiar thei specifi that the mission will be joint militari engin exercis for train purpos which will lead to the construct of variou project for commun us other similar agreement exist on of them ha to do with the exchang of militari personnel anoth ha to do with the integr of the radar network locat in the caribbean and anoth is aim at expand the naval river fleet moreov within the same framework of the tiar there have been variou joint exercis with militari unit from variou latin american countri we can mention the well known naval oper call unita 34 of which have alreadi been held thei have been held everi year sinc 1959 in colombian territori water as well as in other countri naval unit from variou countri ar train with regard to the joint procedur that would be follow in case of an attack from outsid the contin a land exercis ha taken place each year sinc 1962 at a place known as la cangrejera on the atlant coast in 1983 two exercis took place on in tumaco and anoth in san andr in 1991 and 1992 exercis took place in the vicin of the bahia malaga naval base thei were joint exercis with the particip of us and colombian soldier among other therefor by virtu of the fact that at the time tiar wa approv by the congress the defens ministri and all exercis have been carri out on these same legal assumpt and never ha anyon object i do not consid it necessari to request author from the senat or request the opinion of the council of state or inform ani other author the same wai it wa not done in the past with unita and other similar exercis el tiempo but do you believ mr presid that the countri is so naiv as to believ that 150 men from the unit state ar need to build a small school gaviria of cours not all these project can be done by the colombian state but here li the mistak these gentlemen ar militari engin and have come here to carri out joint exercis with colombian militari forc the idea is to teach and practic to share technic experi to solv logist and commun problem which eventu our men would meet in a situat of war instead of expend energi build or make useless thing thei dedic their energi to civic and solidar object the idea is to take advantag of the joint militari engin train and at the same time benefit the area and the commun el tiempo doe the presenc of us soldier in juanchaco violat colombian sovereignti gaviria the presid doe not see it that wai the us militari engin ar in an area total under the control of the colombian navi and carri out their work under the supervis of the arm forc i must also insist that the presenc of militari mission do civilian work is cover by intern agreement that ar current in forc the problem is that mani stori have been weav around thi in fact the el tiempo sundai edit highlight the li that have been us to attack the peopl s good faith i have even heard that a us base will be built in juanchaco to replac the on in panama or wors yet that a new transocean canal is be design good graciou on need to be veri naiv or veri ill intent to spread stori such as these that make no sens all thi uproar lead me to wonder that onc studi ar complet which both the council of state and the prosecutor gener s offic ar do the countri must reflect and decid whether or not it want thi type of assist in the futur my person opinion is that if on believ that thi type of assist is an affront to our sovereignti on is close the door on someth that is basic to make our arm forc more profession not onli that but we would end cooper equip suppli mainten and intellig that allow us to fight crime el tiempo presid but juanchaco is not the onli case what were the us plane that overflew barranquilla thi weekend up to gaviria accord to what the militari forc gener command and the fac colombian air forc report to me the weekend barranquilla overflight had been legal author earlier the civil aeronaut board through the director of air oper had inform on the atlant coast area that thi type of aircraft wa go to overfli colombia in it fight against drug traffick receiv support from the unit state and other countri we do not have all the equip or the requir technolog to support with technic intellig the struggl against drug traffick on the basi of current agreement that seek to repress illeg drug traffick the defens ministri request when condit warrant the support of us plane that ar special equip to detect airplan that have not file a flight plan it is worth mention that overflight by us airplan ar author by decre no 1692 of 1992 the overflight ar to inform the colombian author on the presenc of unauthor plane and that ani other measur such as chase these airplan is exclus the respons of the fac and other nation author you might be ask yourselv why the air traffic control did not know becaus there ar ongo investig of air control involv in drug traffick there ar also peopl who ar interest in stir up fals sovereignti debat encourag by dark sponsor if we ar concern about defend our air space sovereignti the true threat doe not lie in joint oper with the help of friendli countri danger to sovereignti to colombian societi and air secur aris with the hundr of illeg flight without flight plan and with pervers motiv carri out by gun runner and drug traffick over our territori the author overflight ar precis an act of sovereignti to prevent our air space from be us with impun by colombia s true enemi el tiempo how mani air surveil radar ha the unit state instal in colombia who oper them and who us the inform thei collect gaviria current the unit state ha instal four radar the locat facil and equip ar under the command oper and respons of colombian militari author some oper with the technic assist of us civilian organ and other with the technic assist of us militari personnel the radar purpos is precis what i talk to you about earlier that is to

equip which serv to enhanc our intellig work i wish we had more radar and more technic assist in these matter el tiempo some dai ago you said the us militari oper in juanchaco wa humanitarian in natur do you still feel that wai gaviria to be precis i would be more accur to talk of it as a solidar or civic oper i feel that build a hospit or a school like the us militari engin ar do as a by product of the joint exercis is a task that entail goodwil and as the juanchaco resid have said it benefit the peopl of the zone where it occur el tiempo is there ani relat between the war against the cali cartel and the juanchaco oper do the militari oper in juanchaco includ build and oper radio beacon that seek to control drug traffick gaviria i believ i have state with suffici clariti that the juanchaco activ which stem from the memoranda of agreement and understand sign between defens minist rafael pardo and us ambassador busbi have no other purpos than the on announc the joint implement of militari engin project base on reciproc assist treati moreov in view of the evid need of the peopl of that area of the countri the defens ministri and the vall depart governor s offic sign a contract last decemb to build a land strip in juanchaco the codazzi militari engin battalion is implement that project although thi project is be carri out simultan with the on mention earlier it ha no connect with the project the us soldier ar implement all of thi fall within the framework of the colombian constitut and law some peopl who ar doubt have legitim concern other who vehement defend the notion of a us invas ar espous a fals nation that come from bad inform or shadi interest el tiempo why have there been so mani contradict so much secreci so much mysteri in the handl of thi case gaviria no there ha not been ani of that from the start i report the activ go on in juanchaco if you compar the inform the govern issu in decemb to current inform it is exactli the same the public is awar of the scope of the oper arm forc offic have been readi to speak with report and some report have even visit the site as i said i think it is legitim that doubt and question ar express at polit and public opinion level and the govern ha the oblig to answer them i also think howev the countri is the victim of an exacerb and ill intend distort of event i am not rule out the exist of a misinform campaign aim at creat sentiment against intern cooper in the struggl against drug traffick in the past drug traffick have manipul a fals sens of nation to undermin the nation s purpos of rid itself from the slaveri that crimin organ have tri to impos on it we cannot be stoog for those who hide behind our flag to evad the law and protect their illicit busi el tiempo last week s issu of semana refer to a convers with prosecutor gustavo de greiff and us attornei gener janet reno in which the possibl of pardon the member of the cali cartel wa mention how do you feel about it gaviria regard your question the countri know we ar studi the topic either through consult between presid or contact the foreign minist ha made we will make a decis at an opportun time a decis will respond to the interest of colombia and america concern the privat convers between the prosecutor gener and ms reno i must inform you that the inform i have is quit differ from that publish in the weekli in question never for exampl wa there ani mention of the word pardon a pardon is a moral and legal imposs of which neither the presid nor the prosecutor could approv under ani circumst for obviou reason the presid of the republ cannot expand on the issu discuss in that privat meet but he is convinc that the term of the convers differ from the report that were publish what must be stress is that after that convers prosecutor gener de greiff and the us justic depart manag to settl most of the differ that had emerg dure the process of legal cooper wherebi the proof gather in the unit state against drug traffick wa collect for the colombian court nevertheless becaus i am alreadi discuss thi topic allow me to tell you that the presid of the republ ha a high opinion of the prosecutor gener who ha becom on of the moral pillar of our societi with hi legal wisdom and administr skill he ha built the prosecutor gener s offic which wa creat by the 1991 constitut to establish system of litig in our countri moreov he ha done much more than thi he ha brave confront the threat of crimin who see in the prosecutor gener a respres of colombian who refus to allow themselv to be defeat and were not frighten by the onslaught of violenc the prosecutor work shoulder to shoulder with the presid of the republ and hi staff to develop and consolid polici such as the polici of submiss to justic which ha allow a tangibl reduct of the terrorist phenomena associ with drug trafick more recent the prosecutor ha made progress in bring to trial sentenc and jail sever crimin of cours there have been time when we held differ point of view in short differ opinion concern the wai to handl particular case becaus of the good relationship that exist between the presid and the prosecutor and becaus of the need which is acknowledg by everyon to work as a team these differ have been elimin for the good of the countri el tiempo ar the differ the public perceiv between the presid and the attornei gener s offic concern the surrend process for the cali cartel real or imagin gaviria thei ar normal within the sphere of respons of each of the institut the attornei gener s offic on on hand strictli fulfil the dictat of the penal code as it pertain to the right of defend the govern on the other hand also insist on implement strict penalti and on grant the necessari guarante of secur to those peopl who surrend to justic i believ i share the prosecutor s view concern the drug lord eventu surrend to justic moreov if on member of the drug traffick hierarchi want to adher to thi polici he must be sent to a top secur jail also if he want to obtain from the govern the implicit benefit of the submiss polici he must cooper with the author and confess el tiempo the wai these drug traffick ar be held in custodi seem to be on of the reason for disagr to what extent is the govern s sever due to what could be describ as la catedr syndrom refer to envigado maximum secur prison in medellin also known as la catedr consid to be on of the most secur prison in latin america gaviria the govern ha learn from past experi good and bad in turn the govern must make sure that member of societi who surrend to the author do not mock the administr of justic the onli wai to control eventu abus is to keep the inmat in high secur prison protect their right and give them all proper guarante but also have them do their duti as inmat el tiempo the us govern reportedli ha made statement and appli pressur regard the cali cartel it ha also been said that a certain indulg of your toward washington is link to your campaign for the post of oa secretari gener what have you to sai about thi gaviria the unit state is not the onli on that want us to work with the same zeal with which we defeat the now virtual extinct medellin cartel colombian societi is also commit to thi effort with or without the intern commun s request colombia must continu to firmli combat drug traffick colombia must wage a life or death struggl against drug traffick with tool such as surrend i am firmli determin to maintain thi polici i have stood firmli against drug traffick throughout my public life when i wa a congressman dure my campaign for presid when i took up lui carlo galan s banner and as presid of the republ the suggest that the presid of the republ s view of thi problem is influenc by cesar gaviria s eventu run as candid for the post of oa secretari gener is evil and ill intent the countri is familiar with my posit regard drug traffick el tiempo behind the probabl surrend of the topmost leader of the cali cartel and other drug traffick organ li the offer of those who control a larg part of the drug suppli to the unit state to dismantl the busi apart from put a few drug traffick behind bar is it not import for the govern to dismantl a busi whose profit can run in the million and the countri s most complex crimin organ gaviria it is the duti of thi govern the prosecutor gener s offic and the attornei gener s offic to find a good judici solut to break impun and to have the leader of crimin organ cooper with justic go to prison and serv sentenc that serv as deterr if in addit their illeg activ ar dismantl i am sure the attornei gener s offic can negoti sentenc in accord with the penal procedur code in due time the prosecutor gener s offic itself will be abl to assess the cooper of those who submit themselv to justic thi polici must be accompani by the combin action of the intellig servic the public forc the prosecutor gener s offic and the attornei gener s offic against crimin

the unit state what is the situat now at the begin of 1994 in pari london frankfurt or rome in all the great european citi the drug market is boom with an ever increas number of drug addict thi is why i am sound the alarm make an appeal to politician and sai bewar if we continu fight against drug abus in the wai we have for the past 20 year we will definit lose the battl perhap we have alreadi lost it for that matter jauvert can you suggest ani solut kendal there is onli on possibl solut do everyth in our power to reduc consumpt our ruler must final acknowledg thi whatev effort the law enforc agenc make drug produc and dealer will continu to thrive as long as there ar million of consum in our countri the onli wai of break the market is to make demand drop dramat jauvert what about hit the produc countri even harder kendal you can try to of cours recent a french politician even said that thei should be attack militarili if necessari jauvert it wa charl pasqua interior minist am i right kendal you ar sai so jauvert wa it not a good idea kendal let us be realist let us take for exampl the case of medellin cartel s boss pablo escobar will the fact that he wa elimin chang anyth at all no it mai perhap have a psycholog effect on other drug dealer but as to the rest we know for some consider time that hi cartel ha been replac by that of cali in other word the econom and social condit in the produc countri ar such that it is nonsens to believ that peopl there ar go to depriv themselv of the financi benefit deriv from produc coca opium or cannabi of cours we must try to convinc them on wai or the other but we should not expect signific result in the short or even in the long term on that front jauvert what if we help those countri convert their product to coffe wheat rice kendal we must do so obvious but there again let us be realist and look at the result in thailand for exampl a convers polici ha now been implemet for over 15 year but thi did not prevent a heroin product boom from take place in the golden triangl no that is not how the problem will be solv jauvert nor do you believ it will take us ani further to concentr our effort on the drug trade itself and therefor on repress measur kendal no everi year we ar seiz greater and greater quantiti of drug and arrest an ever increas number of dealer howev at the same time the amount of narcot avail in our countri is increas therefor let us continu by all mean to crack down on dealer but there again let us not hope for miracl jauvert not even if the mean of repress were consider increas kendal let us imagin that we doubl the financi resourc avail for the narcot brigad will we therebi multipli by two the seizur i do not think so we will get to know the problem better we will develop what is todai call crimin intellig that is to sai inform techniqu on organ crime thi is import but how can it improv the root problem name consumpt a few year ago the ameriacan tri to determin the ratio between seizur and the amount of drug actual avail well then accord to thi studi in certain countri the ratio is as low as 5 percent and the maximum is 25 percent now research have estim that it would be necessari to seiz 40 percent or even 50 percent accord to a recent investig in order to have a real impact on the market that is in order to reduc consumpt we ar veri far from these figur the traffick stock ar gigant in other word even by increas the repress mean consider we would not achiev a signific impact on drug addict jauvert it might also be possibl to intensifi the fight against the launder of narco dollar which ha becom veri topic over the past few month kendal it must be done of cours but i am afraid that thi new hobbi hors mai lead us to lose sight of the real problem combat the launder of monei is not an end in itself it is onli a mean for stop drug dealer and on which is not let us be frank about it particularli effect let us take for exampl the bcci affair the greatest launder oper ever to be discov what did it come to after four year work after mobil a huge number of polic onli three peopl have been prosecut for launder 14 million dollar now the annual turnov for drug deal is estim at 350 billion dollar about 100 of which would appear to be invest in the intern financi circuit fourteen million out of 350 billion thi is littl more than drop of water in the sea jauvert sinc then special brigad have been set up to combat monei launder kendal so much the better but what resourc do thei have at their dispos in franc for exampl the team compris some twenti peopl ask them how mani case thei ar abl to crack in a year you will be surpris at the ridicul small figur thei will quot you will object that their personnel could be increas thi would of cours be posit but it would not chang the root problem in the least there is in our countri consider demand for narcot and as long as thi is the case you can rest assur peopl will continu to produc drug deal in them and will continu to launder monei jauvert in your view then thi demand can be reduc kendal in ani case we should try to until now there have been few effort in thi direct politician speak of war on drug addict and thei ar right becaus the futur of our democraci is at stake nevertheless let us compar the defens budget to that avail for special center for drug addict do the resourc avail sai in franc or britain exce the price of a singl fighter plane if thi were so i would be veri surpris to learn it the swede howev have shown that when a genuin polit will is there demand can be curtail for some year now thei have been spend consider sum of monei in inform campaign and aid program aim at drug addict as a result consumpt ha drop dramat i am not sai that the swedish model can be transplant anywher but it should be studi more close jauvert why ar western govern in your opinion be so inact kendal i have often ask myself that question and i have found three reason in the first place develop an effect prevent and help program for drug addict is unquestion a difficult task we know the motiv of drug dealer but it is much more difficult to pinpoint the social and psycholog reason that lead a person to heroin even those who ar supposedli specialist in the field do not agre on the most effect form of treatment secondli such program ar extrem expens and onli lead to posit result after a number of year even as long as a decad the third reason result from the first if thei have to invest resourc in combat drug addict politician prefer to concentr their effort on repress the result of which ar more readili perceiv by public opinion howev if we took our time result would follow consid what happen in the case of tobacco follow year of campaign to sensit public opinion consumpt final drop why should it be imposs to do the same in the case of drug addict jauvert to curtail demand you advoc decrimin drug abus why kendal becaus regard consum as offend serv no us purpos in fact it is even danger a convict person discov a cultur in prison which mai make him becom someth he wa not when he first came in name a crimin note howev that i am speak of decrimin drug abus not of legal it i believ drug addict must not be put in jail but rather forc to undergo treatment in a special medic center jauvert ar you in favor then of decrimin the us of heroin and cocain as well as cannabi kendal ye medic doctor have muddl the issu for a long time by try to draw a differ between soft and hard drug as a matter of fact we now know that both ar toxic product the substanc contain in cannabi thc is hazard for the brain it neg effect last longer than those of alcohol for exampl so why should the two type of drug be treat differ jauvert you said that the polic should be abl to forc drug addict to undergo treatment in fact thi is now almost the case in franc with the so call therapeut injunct although few peopl ar awar of thi onc arrest drug user as oppos to peddler can theoret choos between treatment or prison kendal ye but thi law is not be enforc through a lack of mean how mani place ar avail in the special center that can provid treatment for drug addict ten 20 time as mani would be requir in order to be effect throughout europ the state ha so far reli too heavili on chariti organ howev it is up to the state now to take the initi on the other hand thi choic between treatment or inprison seem to me to be inappropri prison is in no case an effect solut drug addict must be treat even forc to do so and doctor must be given the mean to help them jauvert forc how kendal i do not know it is the specialist who must decid jauvert do you think doctor should be allow to prescrib substitut product such as methadon or even heroin kendal why not if result can be achiev in thi wai i have onli on reserv substitut product should not replac on form of depend with anoth for ani great length of time but onc again thi is a matter for specialist jauvert as a matter of fact a few dai ago the highest medic author in the unit state announc it wa favor toward legal pure and simpli kendal i am total oppos to such a view jauvert why kendal simpli becaus legal drug would automat lead to an increas in consumpt do you know why more and more peopl ar in favor of legal becaus through lazi or ignor the phenomenon ha been trivial when 400 kilo of canabi ar seiz in calai who care nevertheless if tomorrow a chemic plant dump toxic product into a river and kill some fish that will stir up a scandal drug dealer do that everi dai by place product that ar highli toxic to human on the market and nobodi sai a word jauvert yet alcohol and cigarett ar sold freeli kendal so what two toxic product ar alreadi social accept is thi a reason to add two more to the list what els should be legal next crack lsd at what ag jauvert it is also argu that legal drug consumpt would reduc the incid of crime kendal for a while perhap but did the end of prohibit caus the mafia or gangster to disappear in the unit state of cours not dealer will find other sourc of profit jauvert nevertheless thi solut is be advoc by policemen in mani countri kendal true i have recent discuss the subject with some british colleagu a few year ago thei would have said an outright no to decrimin wherea todai some scotland yard offici ar publicli pose the question of legal i understand their viewpoint a policeman is there to enforc the law now the law on drug abus ar flout a thousand time a dai so thei ask themselv why not abolish them it is a legitim feel even if i do not share it jauvert so you believ that the moment ha come to start a major debat kendal ye let everyon clearli express their opinon todai european ar veri sensit to ethic and individu respons issu let us take

normandi we ar at the point where the state is begin to invad the territori domin by the mafia the militari victori mai be near but that by itself is not enough the financi and social front must still be address in 1993 cosa nostra kill the parish priest of brancaccio don pino puglisi it wa not a neighborhood murder rather the first attack against a man who had chosen to work with the peopl against the mafia milella at the polit crime trial riina chose not to speak in front of tommaso buscetta is it the begin of the end for the mafia violant all the organ have suffer sever blow but cosa nostra s traffick continu and the camorra and the ndrangheta ar still underestim the ndrangheta is a veri veri danger organ becaus of it connect with subvers element on the right and the corrupt mason lodg the

rest of itali milella what effect have the arrest of the big boss and all the inform had violant we have won mani battl but not the war in the end we will win that too but we will have to pai a differ price mani more on our side will be kill we have to isol the mafia the public ha often live with thi phenomenon the doctor who fake certif as favor shop owner who launder dirti monei the lawyer who act as counselor all thi must stop and to a certain degre it alreadi is stop milella there ar allegedli more shock strike be prepar what doe the mafia hope to obtain can it be stop violant until now we have had two type of attack on kind is extermin the elimin of a singl enemi like the judg gaetano costa and rocco chinnici the other kind is on of dialogu the bomb in the spring and summer protest the harsh prison condit result from the modif made in juli 1992 to articl 41bis of the prison regul we have not yet had strike aim at obstruct which have the same function as the gunfir of a patrol in protect behind the front line in earn time in the futur thi is the kind we will have to deal with milella then why ar thei target individu like you like prosecutor giancarlo caselli and the head of dia gianni de gennaro violant the fact that there ar so mani object prove my theori the murder of giovanni falcon and paolo borsellino just two month apart alreadi signal the begin of thi strategi it is project of extermin target all the strong point milella will the state have the strength to stand up to it violant mani massacr have alreadi been avoid mani peopl ar aliv thank to measur of prevent make an attack more difficult is alreadi a step ahead as is arrest the suspect perpetr milella after the bomb of rome florenc and milan there wa talk of mafia terror of an allianc between the mafia mason extremist on the right and govern secret agent who have turn traitor is thi still a valid theori violant the mafia doe not act alon the crimin element from sicili campania and calabria have alwai had ti with the extremist on the right it happen in the past with the massacr of train 904 todai we have a former member of the new order movement and of the mafia pietro rampulla arrest for the capaci ambush rosario cattafi from messina is involv in the traffic of arm there is domenico papalia a ndrangheta boss who thank to a uniqu appeal wa abl to have hi murder trial overturn papalia wa the first name mention by antonino gioe the mafioso who kill himself in prison milella that allianc wa not just a theoret assumpt violant there exist a system of subvers forc each with it own histori and it own goal which sometim happen to act togeth just think of the corrupt mason lodg that were kei element in the relationship member of the calabrian sicilian mafia etc belong to the same lodg what we ar see is the mafia make us of the mason system milella in 1993 polit men who were thought to be untouch like giulio andreotti and antonio gava found themselv under investig what is chang in the relationship between the mafia and polit who ar the mafia s new contact violant i do not know if senat andreotti and senat gava ar crimin respons veri like the top level of the mafia leadership ar now wait to see what will happen if a separatist polit proposit under whatev name or guis were to go ahead it would be an incred opportun for them the mafia which make invest in it relationship with polit is now wait to see it could be that it is wait to alli itself with the futur winner everyon must keep their ey open milella is the mafia also try to sabatog the investig by influenc the inform violant there could be a strategi of infiltr aim for the most part not at get fals testimoni or stop the trial but at find out where the former mafiosi ar be held how thei ar be guard and what kind of control there is of their famili member so thei can kill them it is a question of predomin thei have to show that thei ar stronger than we ar as for the inform it is about time a code of profession ethic were pass for the magistr which would establish the regul of the relationship with the state s wit and would determin the schedul and format of the confess milella elect ar approach should we be expect demonstr like the bomb in mai and juli violant noth can be exclud by anyon the 5 april 1992 elect were preced by the assassin of salvo lima and follow by the massacr of capaci and via d amelio it is like that the strike of obstruct will take place befor parliament is dissolv and after the elect like in 1992 we have the mean to prevent the attack but some cannot be avoid box p 29 embargo we ar still lag behind in the hunt for mafia monei a meaning comparison would be to sai that todai on the financi front in the fight against crime we find ourselv in the same situat in which we were at the end of the 1970 s with regard to the crimin front in 1994 luciano violant s principl object and the on on which he will be concentr all hi energi is the battl to stop the dirti monei of the cosa nostra and the other crimin organ the presid of the anti mafia commiss explain back then we follow the individu crime commit by the mafia and we did not attack the organ as such the big differ with judg like rocco chinnici gaetano costa giovanni falcon and paolo borsellino wa precis that thei went from concentr on the individu respons for the murder to attack the mafia organ in and of itself as a crime in order to then discov the on who were realli guilti of the assassin on the financi front thi chang ha not yet taken place todai we ar follow the individu case of monei launder with posit result statist but we ar not yet in a posit to attack the complex organ of monei launder the result is that singl channel of monei launder ar discov while all the rest continu what is violant s propos there should be at least on magistr in each district attornei gener s offic to handl mafia financ we also need to review the law control crimin asset becaus the present on ar total inadequ onli 7

oper section sco central oper servic and gico organ crime investig group and the ordinari polic who handl financi matter but without get into our head the idea that we need anoth special organ final intern collabor is indispens becaus a problem like monei launder cannot be confront on the level of a singl countri in the futur some form of embargo will have to be consid for countri and bank that

august it is insist on make chang what ar the chang made in your ministri quiroga there ar three basic aspect we want to chang in the transit from the old interior ministri to the new govern ministri the first on is relat to the intellig servic which terrifi the peopl in the past thi wa the part of the state that investig the possibl of a coup of sedit but we now believ that under a modern and establish democraci like our these servic must contribut to peopl s secur and along with it basic organ which is the polic should be the support of the bolivian peopl to give them daili secur we ar work on it the first step taken is to institution the intellig servic and put them in the hand of the polic in order to prevent them from becom an instrument of the polit power that happen to be in charg of the govern ministri canipa is there no longer a govern ministri intellig servic quiroga there is an intellig servic in the govern ministri that depend on the polic and all it member ar part of the bolivian polic thi is close link to the chang in the polic as part of the first aspect passag omit canipa what will happen with the struggl against drug traffick will it be includ in these chang quiroga of cours to start with we have chang the social defens secretariat which in the past wa exclus link to the issu of coca and cocain it now ha a wider role involv prevent and interdict although interdict wa an import role in the past we believ altern develop is also an essenti issu it will not be possibl to achiev an adequ replac for surplu coca product if we ar not abl to find an econom solut the onli wai that an individu who grow coca stop do it is when he realiz that grow anoth product is more profit than grow coca from the econom point of view thi is what we ar work on we have taken control of the fund for altern develop by chang it structur we creat an execut board presid over by a deleg of the presid of the republ and it respons is share by the execut branch and coca produc we would like to see the execut board creat the idea to carri out altern develop erad will be link to altern develop in those place where erad is be carri out there will be altern develop and where altern develop took place it wa becaus there wa a reduct in coca grow but i am not sai that we will elimin interdict we will continu the work be carri out in the countri but interdict will be exclus against drug traffick not against coca grower or peopl involv in the legal commerci of coca we have a special antinarcot forc felcn that is an exampl for latin america and we will continu to support it becaus we believ that interdict is essenti we also will carri out prevent as an overal part of our strategi and thi is why we creat the social prevent under secretariat which will deal with alcohol drug addict and crime thi organ will help try to prevent these evil in societi through teach program canipa to talk about success and real altern develop not just in speech the wai it is now mean talk about resourc how will you financ the altern develop project to becom a realiti quiroga we ar talk about three basic sourc of financ the first is the resourc that drug traffick itself produc the countri ha mani resourc from drug traffick that ar lost with time we ar talk about a great deal of monei mani asset that have been disappear the on respons wa first the interior ministri later it wa a share respons between prosecutor and the interior ministri now it is the respons of prosecutor and the judg who hand over the asset to truste who later disappear we will propos that the legisl branch chang the law to be abl to immedi auction confisc asset to creat a common fund to support the peopl found innoc after their asset were confisc with thi fund we hope to financ 30 to 35 percent of the altern develop program the second resourc will be multin organ the unit nation and the inter american develop bank ar interest in carri out altern develop program under the concept that the onli wai to do it adequ is through the industri of the area where surplu coca is grown the third financ resourc is the unit state with bilater aid that countri gave about 20 million to 25 million annual for altern develop but a larg part of those resourc were us to pai salari and not necessarili to carri out altern develop with these three resourc which ar not from the nation treasuri in addit to some fund from the nation budget we believ we can carri out a good altern develop polici canipa regard interdict there ha been a great deal of talk about the presenc of colombian drug traffick in bolivia is that true quiroga we have inform about new technolog the technolog us in the countri is differ from that us by the medellin and cali cartel but in the last two year we have seen that the technolog to produc coca and cocain in the countri ha quickli improv and thi make the narcot intellig organ think there is perman and decis cooper by the colombian drug cartel anoth aspect is that probabl 80 percent of the drug produc in the countri goe to colombia whether it goe to paraguai argentina or brazil it final destin is colombia where the last stage of purif is made befor it is sent to the unit state perhap thi is the most import reason to continu with interdict to prevent colombian drug traffick from establish themselv in our countri canipa doe thi repres a threat of violenc quiroga without ani doubt thi mai repres violenc becaus the mafia is violent and we will not send nun from a convent to fight against them we must send outstand offic against them becaus thi is a war a war in which the govern the polic have to fulfil the law when the other side violat them drug traffick violat sovereignti hurt the popul by threaten them and thei also murder with impun it is an unjust struggl becaus on side ha law and regul to fulfil while the other side ha absolut no restrict canipa do you have a list of the main drug traffick in the countri who head the list quiroga we have a perman list that undergo chang base on the arrest made the number on in the countri is meco dominguez who receiv a sentenc and ha escap he is at larg there is also a list of nine individu who ar a number on prioriti for felcn onli two month ago the number on on that list wa nando gutierrez who wa captur as you can see it is a list that chang period we have a felcn that is veri effici but

ar legal depart of secur organ veri activ in help lawmak find a wai to resolv these problem those abroad on the other hand activ seek wai to influenc russia s leadership in the direct of fundament reform of russian special servic for instanc the heritag foundat on commiss from the us congress ha draft a document with recommend of how to bring activ of russian special servic into line with western standard the document propos modif of norm act cover counterintellig activ specif for it to stop monitor foreign citizen travel insid the countri and cut down on the us of covert sourc of inform it also recommend urg the russian leadership to publish as soon as possibl draft of new law regard special servic activ and their financ we too want clear legal regul and civil method of special servic oper but of cours on a pariti basi for instanc a kind of gentlemen s agreement ar reach between special servic of some countri on method that preclud violenc as to a common espionag practic recruit and us of agent us of technic mean for penetr and inform gather and so on everyth in thi respect is the same as befor no agreement will remov the etern problem of espionag in ani case it is hard to imagin reach such agreement with terrorist organ organ crime group involv in illeg arm trade and drug traffick and illeg arm format thu what our counterintellig lack is not a civil demeanor but rather aggress initi and concentr on the greatest threat to the state the practic of year past when for instanc counterintellig offic were sent to monitor complianc with trade regul in store and maintain order in the street and late to inspect motor vehicl in search of contraband should be complet elimin special servic ar an expens item for societi and therefor thei must produc the maximum return the task of counterintellig is to select sever target that ar commensur with it great capabl and try to hit them strictli speak some of the task includ in the statut on the feder counterintellig servic ar not realli counterintellig but rather belong in the sphere of domest intellig and all of them ar part of the sphere of state secur on mai argu to what extent the agenc s name reflect the rang of task it is charg with still i think that thi is not the main problem the main issu is what place the fc should take among special servic in order to successfulli carri out it function the first thing on notic in read the statut is a certain crossov of fc author and that of a number of other special servic as well as of law enforc organ there is a temptat to concentr effort for instanc on suppress of corrupt in on agenc for instanc the mvd ministri of intern affair but then by the same criterion the tax polic should be merg into thi ministri although thi is not done anywher in the world the simplic of such solut is decept sinc the sphere of law enforc need a certain margin of safeti the danger of duplic activ between special structur mai be overcom by increas the degre of their coordin and so to sai divid sphere of interest there ar exampl of thi both in our practic and foreign practic for instanc thank to exist agreement no particular conflict aris between servic engag in intellig gather the fi the gru main intellig director the fc and other a good exampl is the us fbi which over the past few year ha concentr it effort thu make it differ from other law enforc organ on penetr the top organiz echelon of the drug mafia in addit while consid the advantag of concentr all special forc along select direct we also cannot dismiss anoth point of view present by a number of respons politician who emphas the lack of a sensibl balanc of forc among organ of intern affair and secur thu in an organiz sens and in the matter of interact with other agenc the fc occupi it own specif nich in the system of special servic what remain is the issu of coordin but thi is achiev on the basi of the exist system of work liaison between agenc particip in thi work in keep with the fc statut counterintellig organ ar subordin directli to the head of state the guarantor of the constitut of the russian feder and henc it sovereignti independ and territori integr their independ from local author is quit justifi by the specif of the period our countri is go through and give it suffici freedom of action for aggress offens against corrupt group and anticonstitut manifest some correct regard counterintellig could be made through the law on counterintellig which is current be draft in particular it involv investig of espionag case counterintellig need a reliabl profession train investig staff that special along these line thi is a necess not a sign of the fc punit function dure the confirm of the fc statut there were debat on thi matter and it is becom clear it ha not been fulli resolv the idea of creat an investig committe remain an idea while skill cadr capabl of investig complic case remain unutil perhap we should come back to thi problem onc again consid it weigh all the pro and con and prepar propos the organiz legal financi and materi technic condit be put in place for the fc ar onli half of the matter the main part is a train corp of counterintellig profession without whom it will not be possibl to get the activ of thi servic go effect meet the demand of modern russian statehood certif of russian counterintellig cadr ha been complet recent it show that the fc ha suffici potenti evid of thi among other thing is the recent success in disrupt the activ of german and british agent in russia ani counterintellig oper requir a lengthi prepar stage therefor the latest of the publicli known success of our counterintellig ar the result of the painstak activ that preced them whether there ar mani such success or not is anoth matter the time when an nkvd peopl s commissariat for intern affair oblast administr receiv a quota for catch a certain number of australian mexican thai or other spi which wa alwai met and exceed ar past but if we compar the current effect of counterintellig work in russia and for instanc the unit state the achiev ar roughli compar with respect to other line of work howev russian counterintellig still ha a long wai to go feel the differ almost none of those who support the creation of a law base state argu for instanc the need for a democrat state to have such a special servic as foreign intellig no wonder intellig organ as a rule do not work against their own citizen their activ ar aim outsid and thi situat almost everywher is codifi in the law thi mean that when the interest of the state do not conflict sharpli with the interest of it citizen as is the case with intellig the problem of special servic violat right and freedom doe not look all that topic the main heat of critic is reserv for domest intellig us in combat terror organ crime etc as well as counterintellig but while the former which is frequent associ with polit surveil is simpli reject as an instrument of a totalitarian state counterintellig seemingli is permit to exist but under a constant fire of critic from all side from the author for be passiv in uncov and prevent intern threat against the state and from the public for attempt to expand it sphere of function against thi background the public is offer time and again novel but rather lightweight reason on the wai to reorgan russia s secur organ in it the author usual work mainli from two premis the need to remov the threat to democraci present by the heir of compet organ and foreign experi of build a special servic let us leav asid at thi point deliber attempt to mislead the public the reason the author of reform scheme do not understand the substanc of the issu in my opinion is that thei appar incorrectli formul their goal after all if the goal is to remov a potenti threat present by special servic the easiest wai to achiev it is to liquid them in other word the best cure for a headach is the guillotin if howev the task is to creat a democrat state that possess all mean of maintain it stabil the solut should be sought in the balanc of strength and effici of special organ and the abil to keep them under control in thi it would be wrong to disregard extens foreign experi without of cours succumb to the other extrem of automat copi other model without consider for the import special featur of russian realiti sinc there is an opinion that moskovskii komsomolet forecast usual come true let us take as an exampl inform receiv by the newspap from a reliabl sourc about potenti disband of the fc and the transfer of it compon administr to variou ministri and agenc actual thi version wa mention in other public as well the econom counterintellig administr allegedli will go to the ministri of the economi the counterintellig oper administr will find it right place in the ministri of justic and will becom someth like a russian fbi everyth almost like in the unit state but that is the point almost it would be appropri to recal that mani ministri which have similar or even ident name here and abroad carri out differ function for instanc the us depart of the interior deal with land develop manag of natur resourc and is in charg of natur preserv the american depart of justic is more like the russian gener procuraci it is respons first and foremost for monitor complianc with feder law repres feder organ in civil litig and act as a prosecutor when violat of the law ar commit by the wai the head of thi organ is at the same time us our terminolog the gener procur of the unit state of america feel the differ as the famou commerci tell us besid the fbi strictli speak is not so much counterintellig which is the task of onli on of the bureau s mani servic as it is a special combin of a special servic and a law enforc organ along with counterespionag the fbi task includ combat bank robberi aircraft hijack briberi and corrupt kidnap investig and other function thu implement the project let us do as thei do in the west mai lead to the situat describ in a fairi tale where the geni khottabych made a preciou metal telephon apparatu it look like a real on but you cannot make a call on it thi is the kind of counterintellig apparatu we mai get under thi version in order to avoid thi we would have to make dramat modif to the function of the ministri of justic special servic and law enforc organ but thi is alreadi reorgan on a much greater scale which will demand an all out reshap of the structur of execut author when ar we to work then and how much will such a reorgan perform for the sole purpos of bring it more or less closer to the american origin cost the taxpay continu the polem with such a propos it would make sens to ask on more most import question will such a structur work effect in our condit an exampl of a more or less success reorgan of secur organ along western model is the separ of the foreign intellig servic into an independ agenc the rel low cost of thi undertak and there is cost attach to everyth is the result first and foremost of the fact that it predecessor the first chief director had quit consider autonomi even when it wa part of the kgb the border troop were split into a separ servic without ani particular complic for the same reason howev such a straightforward improv of counterintellig is impermiss first even within on counterintellig servic coordin of activ against divers foreign servic aim at differ object and person in russia alreadi repres a rather complex problem which even now is be handl with difficulti what will happen then if counterintellig were broken up into independ agenc respons for individu foreign servic or object or even wors both attribut at the same time a complex and veri expens setup for control and coordin of all domest special servic will be requir someth like a ministri of coordin second in addit to actual oper unit counterintellig ha support unit such as technic support for oper which in their current state simpli cannot be divid thi mean that addit monei will be need to creat their own pocket technic servic or the aforement unit will have to be given the statu of interag bodi with the result need for an addit bureaucrat structur the situat is the same with respect to refer record and inform fund divid which and subsequ work with them present an awesom problem third what do we do about local counterintellig organ in republ krai and oblast divid them by offic depart in principl we could experi us ani model of build a system of nation secur organ german american french or some other but thi is a costli undertak for our current situat with the ministri of financ try to save everi rubl it is even more impermiss in the atmospher of polit instabl where each imprud move caus thunder reverber reform the special servic is normal practic even in the life of state where democraci is an establish practic and problem of distribut of author have been resolv but nowher in the world will we find reorgan for the sake of reorgan new geopolit realiti and the emerg of new threat after the end of the cold war all thi requir from ani state greater attent to special structur reorient of special servic is quit natur the organiz capabl technic equip and financi resourc of crimin organ in a number of instanc ar on par with those of the intellig servic of some countri for instanc the incom of south american drug cartel is compar to the budget of the us cia on can hardli hope to successfulli uncov and disrupt extrem secret activ of crimin group without us special method and mean on can hardli find a countri these dai where the task of special servic as well as organiz method of carri them out ar not be revis to some or other extent our countri is no except in thi respect it ha tri a great varieti of form from the vchk all russian special commiss for combat counter revolut sabotag and specul ogpu unit state polit director nkvd nkgb peopl s commissariat for state secur mgb ministri of state secur and kgb to msb motor rifl battalion afb agenc for feder secur mbvd ministri of secur and intern affair mb ministri of secur and final fc there have also been attempt to merg the special servic with neighbor organ for instanc an inform committe under the ussr mfa ministri of foreign affair wa creat and function and even had it own intellig school on can onli be amaz at the varieti of form it seem that onli the word bureau if we leav asid the komintern communist intern intellig servic ha not been us in the name of domest secur organ it is a rare ministri or agenc that can boast a histori so replet with numer transform it is expect that we learn lesson from the past on of them is that ani reform in addit to plan posit result inevit produc neg on as well first of all with respect to cadr a special servic is not just build equip and method of oper it is first and foremost profession if thei leav success is broken the abil to self reproduc is lost which is absolut counterproduct for a self contain organ which special servic alwai ar on must also mention person who assist secur organ includ on a covert basi success us of a covert agent network without which special servic oper ar imposs is predic first and foremost on public awar of the tremend role of these specif state structur which thei plai in protect the civil societi let us draw some conclus for instanc how delic is the sphere of nation secur which to a consider extent is link with the gener problem of distribut of author in a state that societi s expect it reserv of patienc have reach the limit and we cannot make ani more mistak that each reorgan is anoth trial for profession and that an organiz failur which practic undermin the author of counterintellig is the worst propaganda anyon could conceiv thu we can hardli qualifi as an inform or analyt breakthrough of some mass media the fact that thei regularli spin out a version of anoth reorgan of the fc let us emphas that standard for special servic work ar set not on the basi of theoret model and foreign analog but ar base on the exist state system and the task the state is deal with at ani particular moment in histori how and with what resourc counterintellig organ will be handl the task of ensur nation secur and what chang ar necessari in the fc structur must be defin among other thing also at the initi and with the direct particip of the counterintellig servic itself on the whole howev it mai be said that the task of reorgan ha been solv by the russian feder presid s edict no 19 of 5 januari 1994 which approv the statut on the feder counterintellig servic these document protect russian special servic from cavalri attack from destruct temptat wherev thei mai come from it mai be a paradox but thei complet the success of continu transform of special servic that ha long acquir the attribut of ill conceiv perpetu the mean of these decis is to protect the structur necessari for societi and the state from emot incompet faddish chang to creat condit not for futur reorgan but for normal work of the feder counterintellig servic in the new situat access to special kitchen it is obviou that a strong state need strong special servic for a countri that want to strengthen the state foundat the might of the special servic must be commensur with the obstacl that will have to be overcom along thi road howev in order for special servic themselv not to becom such an obstacl their activ must be subject to strict state and public oversight the creation of such oversight is a problem for ani state sinc it inevit conflict with such an attribut of ani special servic as secreci we know for instanc of a recent incid involv ladi n head of the british mi 5 counterintellig servic whom the press track down after her name wa made public in their evalu it would present no difficulti for numer terrorist group in the countri to organ a kidnap of great britain s counterintellig chief from her home thi scandal incid is anoth argument in favor of those who insist on preserv the british tradit of complet secreci when it come to special servic and their personnel british law set veri strict limit on public access to the

arrang or transact macedonia is on of the rare place in the world where the law exist to be evad where everyth that is not prohibit is automat permit and where on doe not go to jail for an illeg shop

thi is a time of variou con men and worldli troublemak in a situat like the present on it is evid that there ha been a rapid fragment of citizen and increasingli deeper dissatisfact among the public with the strike case of abus machin and specul the claim that the state author do not have a role in such dirti busi ar stori for littl children in a word no matter how pain it sound the ancient system of a link between econom and polit power is slowli come onto the scene in the republ of macedonia in turn thi is creat the precondit for reviv the allianc between crimin circl and the state establish and in some countri that is call the mafia thu in parallel with the newli establish businessmen murder for hire threat blackmail kidnap racket loan shark and drug smuggler have appear in macedonia i e everyth that embellish a classic mafia the mafia is in the govern or there is organ crime in macedonia and that ha to be said openli for onc said pavl trajanov assist minist for oper affair in the ministri of intern affair what is signific in all thi in hi opinion is that organ crime ha slowli begun to penetr the state s execut branch sinc crimin conduct in an organ manner is not possibl unless the author particip in it or in our case individu ministri of the govern of the republ of macedonia as our interlocutor emphas there ar sever evid case of machin under the leadership of state bodi on of the most characterist case is the process of obtain a locat for the construct of a temporari or perman build the ministri of citi plan construct transport and ecolog particip in issu the build permit and the ministri of economi for a permit to conduct busi and to these on must add the ministri of financ through the tax inspector and the sok public audit servic in thi whole chain where numer abus have appear as trajanov said it is imposs that some of the institut cite ar not involv the case of import product is even more specif we have analys for three year back of which firm receiv import permit and which amount thei import trajanov said from which it can be clearli seen that all these thing revolv around a small number of enterpris which receiv import permit and then simpli sell them to anoth firm and natur in the end the monei is share with the on that provid the permit in other word the on who is closer to the author through ani type of close gain a privileg statu for earn a profit thu there ar no built in criteria for all those who have an interest in import instead protectionist measur ar creat through which onli a narrow circl of firm ar patron i can state quit authorit that the execut branch bodi ar behind all of thi trajanov said categor thi highli organ crime ha been go on for two year and high offici in both the product enterpris and the govern ar particip in it accord to the assist minist of intern affair it is not possibl for what is produc and what is market not to be record without the involv of some govern ministri sinc the net profit from just on truckload of cigarett is about 300 000 german mark dm the basic methodolog of organ crime is briberi and corrupt accord to our interlocutor these mode ar conduct todai in a veri perfidi manner we have a great deal of inform he emphas that state offici even govern minist have privat firm usual in the name of a close rel through which organ crime take place how the method is veri simpl first a permit is obtain for the transit or import of certain good into macedonia and then the trade in the good is conduct through on s own firm formal everyth is within the law pavl trajanov said but the genesi is in the ordinari abus of on s posit nevertheless as our interlocutor emphas the most modern form of organ crime is act as a middleman in other word those who ar a factor in decisionmak onli act as middlemen among two or more firm and receiv a commiss in return for exampl if there is an offer from some foreign firm for instanc for export technic equip need by a certain ministri or other state institut then the middleman appear and put the foreign firm in touch with the domest on and charg a commiss for thi thi trajanov said constitut a textbook case of corrupt the govern is in the mafia as polic our hand ar ti by sever thing that keep us from deal with organ crime effici pavl trajanov said in hi opinion it is imposs for the polic without cooper with other supervisori bodi in the state to act on their own in thi area and likewis anoth big problem is the still incomplet legal regul defin certain relationship in the state which at the moment ar activ be exploit by organ crime our limit our interlocutor emphas is the constitut barrier accord to which onli letter can be monitor while the monitor of telephon and other mean of commun is not permit if thi doe not chang in a short time and the us of these oper technic mean that would be us under strictli establish legal condit and by a decis by a compet judg is not permit we will onli obtain inform that we will be abl to comment on but it will be much more difficult for us to obtain evid without which crimin proceed cannot be start trajanov state categor now there ar alreadi variou indic inform and abov all fact show that organ crime exist in macedonia and that abov all the state institut of the execut branch ar involv in it all of thi trajanov emphas doe not forc us as the polic to restructur ourselv organization it is plan that a special section will be form soon at the ministri of intern affair that will deal exclus with curb organ crime and that will possess all the necessari condit for effect oper that abov all mean it staf and profession of it oper as well as provid it with appropri technic equip i want to emphas trajanov said that the ministri of intern affair is serious prepar and is alreadi consider involv in all these matter associ with organ crime the ministri of intern affair he ad possess an extens bodi of inform and it is known quit well who is involv in these illeg activ how and why includ individu who at the moment ar in high govern posit parallel rule by organ crime collect organ crime constitut on of the form of profession crime which is character by a close allianc between profession crimin and law enforc offici said dr tome batkovski a lectur at the secur school in skopj accord to criminologist from western countri of which thi form of profession crime ha been and is most characterist organ crime could not exist without connect and assist from polit and politician profession crimin connect with govern offici batkovski emphas give repres of organ crime an enorm advantag over other crimin precis becaus of that protect that thei have there is actual a tremend threat to the human right of a larg part of the popul just becaus the center of power goe outsid the framework of the legal institut the crimin area of activ of collect organ crime consist of smuggl narcot white slaveri smuggl monei gold and other valuabl and cultur good smuggl weapon carri out paid kill prostitut gambl and recent sell ecolog wast accord to dr batkovski the characterist of the illeg associ whose activ in practic is organ crime ar the follow abov all intern organ structur the exist of intern standard of conduct with disciplin in carri out assign a divis of duti a broad radiu of activ high effect with the us of modern method a high degre of maneuver and go beyond the nation framework final accord to batkovski on of the most fundament characterist of organ crime is the brutal of it approach i e a lack of scrupl and it basic method is corrupt and directli associ with it blackmail threat and retali organ crime repres a tremend social danger abov all becaus it introduc disorgan in the state destroi the legal fabric of societi instil distrust among the legal state bodi and in the case of smaller state there is a danger of parallel rule by organ crime which can have unforese consequ for undevelop countri includ macedonia accord to dr batkovski the extent of the power of thi form of crime is best illustr by the case of the colombian cocain mafia which offer to repai part of thi countri s foreign debt in the amount of believ it or not 28 billion in return the colombian govern wa suppos to refus to extradit the captur head of the drug mafia to the unit state dr batkovski stress that thi is a vital exampl of the enorm power of organ crime we ar talk about an extrem seriou matter and i think that the struggl against thi organ crime ha to be an integr part of a nation strategi in the broader sens our interlocutor emphas without that through palli and partial solut noth can be achiev tome batkovski said in conclus box p 16 batkovski organ crime should not be underestim if we ar talk about the struggl against organ crime we should note onc again that it possess enorm power and influenc it is precis for that reason that it is alwai on step ahead of societi in the us of modern method and resourc that mean that in curb it the state s expert bodi and servic have to keep up to date and stai in step with the method and resourc us by repres of organ crime from the standpoint of it organ modern oper servic have to be creat that will be capabl of maneuv quickli and adapt to organ crime s method and resourc but on the other hand that requir a societ guarante to the employe of these servic not just by ensur the safeti of their famili but also in their salari sinc it is an illus that an employe with a salari of dm300 or dm400 will object be capabl of deal with illeg activ in which hundr of thousand or million of german mark ar involv box p 16 trajanov some polit parti ar also financ by dirti deal i can authorit state that the mafia in macedonia is assum an increasingli larger scale and is threaten to grow into a parallel state govern likewis i stand behind the assert that numer peopl in author ar also involv in organ crime in our countri especi in the macedonian govern s ministri those who ar now enrich themselv thi wai will slowli and sure achiev influenc in polit life as well we alreadi possess inform that certain polit parti ar be financ by such dirti deal and busi in other word someon who invest in a certain polit parti will subsequ demand compens i e greater polit influenc and particip in the divis of power in the countri all the precondit now exist for a high degre of corros in the state and the consequ
