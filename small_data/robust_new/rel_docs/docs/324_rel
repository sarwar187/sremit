social organ the feder govern is respons for creat the econom condit to erad margin but the success of thi endeavor requir the concert action of all we do not shrug our respons on the contrari we ar well awar that the kei to thi problem li in the creation of new job and thi is precis what we ar try to do i would like to now turn to the main problem exist in the area of labor and social secur and the govern s propos to come to grip with them to have an overal understand of thi issu i will begin by make a categor assert the argentin labor relat system ha not evolv at the same pace as domest and intern event the preval of labor regul institut and behavior which go beyond what is reason have much to do with the problem confront us todai with regard to job and work condit concern the former we ar concern by two thing first our low employ rate the import of thi is seen if we bear in mind that of 100 inhabit who ar in a posit to work in sweden 70 have a job wherea onli 42 have a job in argentina how far we ar from the goal that each on should produc at least what on consum second unemploy which strongli affect mani of our home and even though the unemploy rate doe not exce averag intern unemploy rate it is a factor that must be taken thoroughli into account on the other hand and i want to be veri clear on thi point we ar not interest in import the first world s flaw but rather it virtu the struggl against corrupt therefor repres on of our administr s prioriti and irrevoc goal yet anoth more signific point is that the argentin economi despit the record growth achiev dure the past three year ha been unabl to creat enough employ with respect to work condit the govern s and societi s concern involv three other issu first the lack of dynam in collect bargain trade union and employ have not manag to find a wai for the gener decentr and renew of collect labor agreement a situat that might be at least partial blame on some legal obstacl and the shortcom of the labor administr system in thi regard it is import to take as an exampl an agreement sign between smata trade union of mechan and relat automot transport worker and gener motor a practic and flexibl agreement wa reach an agreement that benefit both side thi type of respons initi improv the legisl in thi field favor increas employ second the high rate of labor accid the number of labor accid or ill is veri high in our countri thi is further aggrav by the fact that the prevent system is insuffici and the recoveri system unsuit partial and inappropri third the excess court involv in labor conflict year of state intervention have prevent the develop of independ practic for the solut of conflict thi ha result in an excess costli and ineffici transfer of these conflict to the legal field in a nutshel the current labor system is serious affect our competit possibl limit our economi s abil to creat job and make impractic the principl of solidar equiti and social effici these reason actual explain my administr s firm decis to promot a substanti transform of labor rule and practic seek to favor the creation of job promot the competit of our compani and improv labor condit nevertheless regardless of the emphasi we place on thi effort which is of a pure reformist natur we will not successfulli meet the pend challeng in the field of employ and competit unless we ar abl to

to argentina we have the exampl of south africa the middl east the chang take place in russia in the former yugoslavia the chang the world is experienc ar so unpredict and fast that someth like that could happen argentina doe not want to rush thing howev sinc 1983 and 1990 when relat with great britain were restor and especi with presid carlo menem s administr and the implement of domingo cavallo and guido di tella s foreign polici what ha chang is our concern over the island interest in the past thi aspect wa not taken into account as much as it is now carvallo in what sens petrella democrat argentina realiz that the island have their own ident that the island societi is no longer the pastor nor isol societi it wa befor 1982 to a certain degre the war with all it terribl aspect brought an econom well be the island did not enjoi befor these fact must be taken into account in a negoti in fact dure all our meet with the british and the island we have fulli respect their interest we believ the island will gradual grow closer to us through dialogu and the fact that argentina continu to grow and is predict from the polit viewpoint in addit the southern cone offer a climat of harmoni cooper friendship and firm regard our claim carvallo but ar the island awar of that petrella there ar concret sign that lead us to believ that our polici ha prompt a debat on the island if you read the penguin new local daili as carefulli as we do you will notic that the island discuss a relationship with argentina natur it is not alwai fulli posit thei argu and sai rude thing about us but at

petrella definit first becaus it is not ethic second becaus it doe not gener solut and third becaus we appreci and need our relationship with great britain and europ which is almost the same thing these ar three veri pragmat and clear reason that ar by no mean idealist when we talk about ethic we ar not talk about ideal we ar talk about someth veri sound and veri special forc doe not yield solut it is a boomerang becaus in the long run it would affect our relationship with great britain and europ onli recent argentina overcam the us and european embargo that follow the war thi problem ha still not been solv with great britain who still refus to sell us spare part and militari equip thi is veri complic becaus most of argentina s militari equip tradition wa british passag omit carvallo it ha been said that the island have about 50 percent more oil than what great britain can extract from the north sea petrella the two compani that have prospect for oil with the purpos of find someon interest in bui their studi might sai that no on ha bought that studi although the british sai a phantom argentin enterpris did but i do not know for sure argentina doe not want to hasten a debat that not onli ha an ecolog aspect but also a veri import person aspect everyon know that it take a lot of peopl to exploit a singl oil well and thi will definit chang the island wai of life which we consid sacr and someth that must be preserv passag omit carvallo it is quit surpris that argentina through you should sai that it is not particularli interest in ani oil there might be on the island petrella i am not make an offici statement it is a comment to a journalist who work for el mercurio from chile a friendli countri i am tell a friend that argentina could not care less about the oil on the malvina becaus it ha plenti of it own and becaus the oil price is not go to increas when russia flood the world with it oil a veri strict cartel will have to be creat to prevent price from drop carvallo some believ oil could caus new tension in the south atlant petrella between 1971 and 1982 we gave oil to the island therefor oil is not the problem the problem ha to do with the jurisdict and legal aspect of the uk unilater explor and exploit in the malvina thi territori is in disput and we cannot remain indiffer to unilater action thi is why we ar seek cooper carvallo to defin sovereignti petrella that is the question we must gener a common space we have alreadi made a clear propos regard the oil to a high rank offici we propos creat a joint author to assign exploit area accord to a practic criteria all thi must be done under the sovereignti umbrella that wa creat to enabl these move without either of the two parti acquir better accumul right carvallo in the

disput ha been settl or until the involv parti have agre to toler each other passag omit carvallo island governor david tatham said to me why so much interest in a joint oil exploit with argentina when there is also chile uruguai and brazil what would your ministri sai about thi petrella the disput is with argentina brazil chile and uruguai as well as the rest of the countri of the hemispher have recogn our right the uk could obvious contact whichev countri it wish if a disput recogn by the unit nation did not exist carvallo what do you expect from chile then petrella solidar that contact with the island be made consid argentin interest in ani negoti that chile maintain the magnific commit undertaken by presid patricio aylwin to back our right we regard thi as on of chile s greatest act of friendship throughout our common histori on of the main object of presid menem s foreign polici implement by foreign minist di tella ha been to maintain the best and most cordial relationship with chile and thi not onli becaus of cultur reason but for econom and strateg reason carvallo chile howev is in the uncomfort posit that whatev it doe mai affect it optimum relationship with the two countri in disput petrella argentina s stanc on the uk ha been to sai that it must plai a construct role in the southern cone in other word it can no longer specul on differ between argentina and chile as in the past when some were more obviou than other becaus there wa usual mutual distrust thi must no longer exist argentin chilean integr must progress thi is why ani british govern gestur that mai affect the argentin chilean relationship is consid discourag in argentina we have told the british thi mani time and we ar certain we have the support of the chilean govern carvallo what ha great britain done late regard chile that mai discourag argentina petrella there were three episod on wa the british govern invit to chilean legisl to visit the malvina thi in itself is not especi sensit but the second episod propos that thei set up a chilean consul on the island is that would realli be complic the third the donat of an aircraft is obvious a symbol of the conflict sinc argentina overcam the conflict it caus no more problem but mani believ the british should have known the effect thi could have caus anywai the argentin chilean friendship is veri strong now passag
