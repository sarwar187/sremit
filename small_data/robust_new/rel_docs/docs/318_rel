physician of moscow s hospit no 52 he ha seen a great deal dure these year know a great deal and ha thought over a great deal he ha someth to sai what is a hospit a place where thei oper treat and care for patient and help them recov their strength but i would put it more briefli a hospit is a center of pain and sorrow that is why a physician who bend over a patient in the oper room dure resuscit or simpli in a ward intens catch hi breath and puls and see how suffer is replac by hope in hi ey i onc thought that in the physician s conscious there wa no room just then for the thought

point is for all form of ownership to be equal for equal condit to be creat for all it cannot be that the director of state enterpris would pai wage of 200 000 and a commerci establish next door 2 million condit should be equal for all for all form howev i agre with you that the state cannot carri the weight of the trade sector consum servic small enterpris the garment and light industri agricultur howev there is collect properti too zholdak agricultur is precis what i am veri much interest in it is a fact that the financi and credit system of the countri ha broken down i am sai thi and you will object but i will now prove it to you kravchuk i am not sai no i am sai that it ha broken down zholdak all right the current crop of agricultur product confirm thi look the state ha order these product the state wa suppos to bui them it also promis kolkhoz member resourc on a preferenti basi the state ha now gone bankrupt it ha taken all the grain but ha not paid either the billion or the trillion in a convers with me ivan stepanovych confirm that these ar trillion and the state is not pai back thi is the question for you leonid makarovych kravchuk why not pai back it is pai zholdak mere drop it is not pai back kravchuk it is the state is pai back albeit with difficulti and will pai back a differ system for relat between the state and the agrarian sector ha been approv for 1994 it is suppos to ensur a new approach in order to somehow resolv these acut problem gradual zholdak mr presid academician ihor yukhnovskyi who is also the polit comment of ukrayinska hazeta ha propos to lai tax in kind on farm he ha inform you in thi case the state will have an abund of foodstuff without spend monei just for tax in kind for exampl i oper my own farm and i am suppos to give the state on third of the crop depend on the qualiti of land what is your view of thi kravchuk well thi should be calcul thi idea of ihor rafayilovych should be work on zholdak a farm could give the state a certain establish proport of grain or meat per hectar it would be interest in increas the output of product becaus a fix unchang tax would be establish the greater the crop grown by peasant the more thei get to keep thi is advantag to all kravchuk howev thi is natur economi rather than the market thi should be calcul properli zholdak so you approv of thi idea kravchuk as an idea that should be studi well an expert analysi of which should be made zholdak leonid makarovych thi is a pain question how ar we to get rid of specul at everi step we take can we realli not give minist of intern affair andrii vasylyshyn the right to at least scare these middlemen in the time of the communist era there wa never such rapac and fraud on our street and squar next to railwai termin as we have now those who tri to resel merchandis from store were put behind bar right awai now thi is free big busi if onli thei were peddl their own product kravchuk previous if thei caught someon thei did not look at the law thei caught them and put them in prison right awai zholdak and why do vasylyshyn s peopl not do it thi wai now kravchuk everybodi must act in keep with the law and there should be good law zholdak the law is what it is but if a store salesman pass for exampl deterg to hi peopl through the back door and these good ar sold at four to five time their price is thi not a crime kravchuk can you prove it zholdak next to the ukrain depart store in kiev close to the stop of street car no 1 plump women sell on packag at 13 000 14 000 in the shop thi merchandis cost 3 000 but it is not avail it is simpl to prove that the street peddler did not manufactur the deterg powder herself kravchuk she will sai i bought it and now i do not need it and you do not have to bui it there should be normal provis and arrang for their applic although the law enforc organ ar not do everyth by far there ar also other problem of democraci for exampl you bought a product in anoth countri and brought it in for sale you set a price those who want it bui it and those who do not do not thi is your right how is thi specul thi should not be put simpli and primit if i am sell thi amount to specul i agre with you on someth els if you bui someth in a store and then go out and sell it right awai i am against it howev thi should be translat into law if you follow close the meet of the coordin council for combat organ crime minist vasylyshyn and hi gui ar alreadi do noth but thi in order to cleans our street and squar in front of railwai termin from impud middlemen there is on more point if econom condit ar not creat you will first establish control over yourself and over the on who control and thi chain mai go on to the point of absurd becaus nobodi ha yet defeat either specul or other crimin affair by administr legal control alon zholdak well thi did not happen dure the communist era comrad former secretari of the communist parti of ukrain central committe i maintain thi as a former member of the cpsu kravchuk there wa anoth system a system of a totalitarian regim pressur and lawless were the foundat of polit zholdak is anyth at all allow now kravchuk no zholdak nonetheless how ar we to find bear for the peopl so that thei will live honestli and happili kravchuk there is a wai out we should make a transit to such live condit that it will no longer be advantag for peopl to resel zholdak it will not be advantag when everyth that we need appear in store kravchuk thi is what it is about i know from your write that you have been to pari tell me did you see specul on the street and squar over there or did you see these shack and stand with which the oblast seat especi kiev ar strewn zholdak pari and kiev ar not in the same leagu kravchuk it will also be like thi here ukrain will definit becom as rich as sai franc time is need the skill of econom manag of our peopl is still the main point i have met with the former presid of turkei ozal he told me the follow stori well our flock of sheep were driven to iran all the time we could not do anyth we set up border brought in the polic imprison the guilti execut and so on noth work howev what did we do later we increas price for our wool and hide price becam higher than in iran the sheep began to come over to us from there onli econom instrument mai realli influenc our situat you see there ar 52 million peopl and each of them want to find hi nich in life includ an econom nich thi is why it is imposs for gener vasylyshyn to assign a control to everyon zholdak it is so leonid makarovych howev when i see thi abomin specul in the street thei even resel polit cigarett my heart bleed for the honest peopl who ar be fleec in thi ungodli manner thei make million in on or two dai mai your heart bleed we should fight such evil resolut after all kravchuk not onli my heart bleed i do not want my heart to bleed zholdak i am sai thi figur kravchuk i understand i want real work to be done what we ar now do togeth with minist vasylyshyn and head of the sbu secur servic of ukrain marchuk is real and we do it with the border guard the nation guard and custom agent there is materi to dissemin

method on a temporari basi why doe thi not exist in other countri we want to prevent thi under our circumst meanwhil our effort should now be focus on product without rule out the fight against specul i talk about it all the time product is fall but we want to live better zholdak so why is product not grow kravchuk product will increas if the state provid the condit and we ar now work on it thi is the main point howev second when peopl begin to work as thei should here is a simpl and at the same time complex wai out of the crisi for you and for all of us will there be commun in an isol oblast

FBIS3-39627: languag danish articl type cso interview with prime minist poul nyrup rasmussen by lisbeth knudsen and ol lorenzen place and date not given the critic you learn from text after on year as prime minist the fight against unemploy and the effort on behalf of the less privileg still ha top prioriti poul nyrup rasmussen will never abandon hi hope of get a job for everyon but the prime minist would rather promis too littl than too much he ha said mani of the same thing for a year and he ha thought about persist in sai them in 1994 and 1995 as well dane will hear a prime minist talk about whether we will do someth about unemploy despit public opinion poll and politician from the parti that make up the coalit govern as well that sai that we will never again see full employ that is an opinion to which poul nyrup rasmussen will not subscrib the social democrat parti sdp will never abandon it hope of creat a framework in our countri within which everyon can be activ regardless of whether econom condit turn up or down it is our basic point of departur that everyon should be abl to work said poul nyrup rasmussen in advanc of the govern s first anniversari next tuesdai employ wa the main issu when the govern came into offic and it will be the main issu for mani year to come but we ar talk about full employ that is differ from what we knew in the 1960 s work will be better distribut we can inde get everyon work but it should be clear that that mean join with the chang in valu that ha occur peopl also want to have time left over just to have thing if we just want to have more thing then that is when the pinch will come the prime minist said det fri aktuelt but do you believ that a reduct in unemploy from 350 000 to 330 000 by the end of thi year is enough to convinc peopl that we can achiev full employ rasmussen it is true that at the end of 1993 unemploy had not come down enough but there is so much forc in thi that if we have a chanc to continu our work then it will succe all the same i do not exclud the possibl that the number will get better becaus there is so much spring come in the economi but in contrast to the former govern i will not predict anyth that cannot be achiev i would rather give a realist cautiou view a better daili life but even if employ is still the main issu the govern s agenda is not exhaust poul nyrup rasmussen ha a number of point that dane will hear about in the month to come rasmussen the first thing is that the reform must work in practic it doe not surpris me that with such major reform there ar administr problem everyth cannot work from dai on so togeth with the citi we must see to it that everyon get the messag with regard to tax reform i can veri well sit here and sai that 770 000 retire out of 800 000 will get tax cut that is no help it is each individu who should know what the chang mean det fri aktuelt but ha your govern been good enough about inform peopl about thi rasmussen no we haven t we have to work on thi throughout all of 1994 but for exampl with regard to retire it is import for me to emphas that thei will get their monei there will be a shift in the time but thei will get it the govern s second task will be to come up with visibl improv in peopl s everydai live in select area rasmussen we have just start with regard to child care i mention the child care guarante in my open speech to the folket thi ha not been forgotten in negoti with the citi we will see to it that by the end of 1995 everyon will be abl to have their child care for from the time it is on year old second there is the health sector we want to bring the wait period down to three month we want to get the bed out of the corridor the third point is servic to the elderli and those live alon where we will see to it that peopl come and visit them thi is not just a matter of whether there ar enough home care helper but of make sure there ar a number of other import peopl nearbi who can help fourth those peopl who live quiet live in the shadow regardless of whether thei ar mental ill or handicap will have better daili live we will creat framework so thei will have a better life real result he is pleas with the wai thi first year ha turn out tax reform labor market reform and leav of absenc provis ar the biggest reform to have been implement in the past 10 year and the prime minist doe not agre with critic within hi parti about the lack of a social democrat profil and the talk that the govern is still nonsocialist rasmussen i have heard voic from that choru i would sai two thing about thi histori ha also taught us that social democrat minor govern do not have difficulti achiev a profil but sometim thei have difficulti turn the profil into real result basic i have been concern after 10 year in the opposit with on singl thing social democrat posit should be turn into practic result not 100 percent thing have realli never been that wai nor were thei in our earlier histori but good progress in the right direct that i believ we have achiev the worst thing that could happen between 25 januari last year and the elect at the end of thi on would be if peopl could sai to a govern head up by the social democrat well you promis a lot but you didn t do anyth det fri aktuelt so you aren t afraid that the outcom of the elect for the sdp will be affect by the fact that you as prime minist have had to agre to an aw lot of compromis to get the govern to stai togeth rasmussen no i m not afraid of that social democrat voter and voter gener speak have a veri good sens of what the work condit ar the sdp ha alwai been will to cooper with other parti social democrat voter know full well that result come about onli through consciou cooper if i seem optimist it is becaus what we put our effort into we have implement and now the result ar start to show we will be veri care to see to it that the system that ar now set up do not get defend just for the sake of the system we want to be readi to listen and make adjust where that is necessari no to a presidenti elect det fri aktuelt but suppos we turn thing around there ar two parti in the govern that look as if thei will be wipe out as consequ of be part of the coalit govern won t you have to be veri consider of them rasmussen i am convinc that the center democrat cd will see an increas influx of voter the cd ha a joint respons for econom polici and social polici the cd is also a social awar parti that will not go along with extens social cut so combin with their preoccup with busi polici the cd voter will also acknowledg that with regard to the christian peopl s parti from the begin the parti ha put great emphasi on famili polici the christian peopl s parti can rightli point out that the parti ha had a lot to do with the chang that ar now occur for famili with children det fri aktuelt will there also be room for them in an elect that is about poul nyrup rasmussen or uff ellemann jensen rasmussen here there is a bit of an influenc from the wave we have been see from the unit state thi preoccup with individu the upcom folket elect ha been call a presidenti elect between uff ellemann jensen and myself i do not look upon it that wai on the on hand i will show up ani time when we have to discuss polici posit and platform what doe the liber parti want what do the sdp and the govern want i veri much want to take part in discuss thi and there will be no shortag of involv and appear on the other hand i will have to back out if uff ellemann jensen want to engag in mudsling if so he ll have to find someon els to plai with person issu ha it unavoid place in the modern media pictur but it must never gain the upper hand a discuss between the liber parti on the on hand and the sdp on the other is a much too simplifi pictur of danish polit there should be room for all parti my effort will alwai be to have everi shade of opinion repres that exist in the pictur there should also be room for the cd to have it profil for the christian peopl s parti to have it and the radic liber to have it you shouldn t get shaken up det fri aktuelt nevertheless don t you think some when as prime minist you see your parti dip under 30 percent in the opinion poll rasmussen in a job such as thi you think long and hard primarili you sai to yourself that on week s opinion poll two week opinion poll the summer of 1993 s opinion poll can be hard to take a bit of concern and alarm can spread but deep down insid you tell yourself you ve got time for yourself and what you re do go to the troubl of explain what we re in the process of do it s clear that there were time dure the summer of 1993 when there were major demand place on my own sturdi it mai well be that nice thing will not alwai be written but that s now the wai it is in danish polit you shouldn t get shaken up by a littl neg critic but i make a major distinct between whether it is person critic or critic becaus of the job you have the latter you can put up with and you ve got to learn from it det fri aktuelt have you thought about celebr the anniversari on tuesdai rasmussen we ll celebr with a govern meet an even meet at which we will first discuss polit and then we ll sit down with on anoth have a drink and have a good time

been part of it and is still part of it as a uniqu type of civil system analysi of the cours of reform and the result of russia s socioeconom develop over the past 2 year make it possibl to draw a number of conclus first the deep crisi and the social problem ar not the result of the unresolv problem individu miscalcul or the opposit of conserv forc although all thi had a place but the unavoid consequ of the cours of reform chosen and the method of implement them the attempt to solv all the problem in on leap by a cavalri charg wa dictat not by sober scientif calcul but by impati and polit ambit despit the assert of it initi thi polici ha been and continu to be highli ideal and it is be implement by neobolshevist method second after see the collaps of their chosen cours of econom polici from the first step of it implement the initi of shock therapi did not learn ani lesson but continu to stubbornli insist on it continu thi onli aggrav the situat even more and brought new hardship for the peopl in order to conceal their fiasco the reform in power proceed to engag in systemat misinform of the public and misrepresent of the true situat in the economi and the life of the peopl third from the everi begin there ha been an erron orient toward the decis role plai by foreign aid and domest sourc to stimul busi activ especi invest activ have not been put into action it becam clear

even after it complet failur wa reveal henc the unwilling to listen to critic and the depict of thi critic as allegedli come from the enemi of reform the notion that there is no altern for the reform but the strategi and tactic for implement it chosen by the author of shock therapi ar be stubbornli impos on public opinion fifth the unprofession of the initi and champion of the shock therapi polici ha becom obviou by now the public ha encount a new varieti of subjectiv and voluntar in the develop and implement of econom polici and clearli express ideolog attach in the polici itself howev there

support the russia s choic bloc whose leader ar the ideologist and champion of thi polici continu thi polici even further mean act against the clearli express will of the peopl the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund believ that in the name of restor russia as a great power it is essenti to critic and honestli assess the result of the past 2 year and to work out a new strategi of social and econom reform on a new strategi for social and econom reform select of a strategi for socioeconom reform is on of the kei question of theoret thought and polit

notion about the unequivoc adher to direct of social progress and about the exist of a certain ideal model of a socioeconom system for all countri and peopl choos a strategi for socioeconom reform is a complex state and public process which requir not onli thorough scientif studi but take into account the will of the peopl and the consent of lead public and polit forc and movement certain basic

for financi stabil of the nation economi base on elimin of disproport between the materi substant and financi cost aspect of reproduct fourth set the object of form a singl all russian market as a

inflationari measur aim at limit the monei suppli and reduc the budget deficit depriv the entir nation economi of the opportun to make effici structur chang and lead to intensif of the product recess the lack of invest doe not make it possibl to chang the structur of technolog and therebi stop the cost inflat under these condit onli after chang the relationship of price to basic product and resourc and make the structur of domest price more appropri for the structur of cost and the structur of the technolog which we have can the macroeconom prerequisit be creat for save and expand invest activ the normal function of product and an effect structur polici accomplish thi task by further price liber chiefli for energi resourc when the monopoli posit of the main commod produc is maintain will constrict the market even further and lead to a new upsurg in inflat further product recess and the collaps of entir sector the economi will be pressur by a new level of price and the price relationship will turn out to be inappropri for effici structur reorgan a differ path is more feasibl us of the tradit stabil measur appli in mani countri in similar situat thi mean the us of state price regul method in a given stage for those commod which increas nation econom cost to the greatest extent at the same time it is import to note two circumst first regul of price is not a repetit of previou method of econom oper even if the state resort to it quit extens at present unfortun not within the system and purposefulli often under the influenc of the lobbi interest of individu group without coordin with budgetari credit and invest polici separ from the dynam of incom second the method be propos for creat prerequisit for a normal reproduct process is object veri complic to implement it will inevit requir substanti effort from the state those engag in econom activ and labor collect but under the present condit in our view there is no other sensibl altern to it other variat by increas the price of stabil immeasur mai end up with a complet econom collaps the model we propos assum the follow sequenc of action price for a limit group of raw materi resourc and railroad tariff ar fix for a definit period of time the state liquid it indebted to the sector and sphere of the nation economi and after that the relationship of price and the wage level ar normal by mean of the conciliatori process within the framework of thi group the problem of index wage in sector subject to price regul mai be resolv by us special wage regul fund form either with tax receipt from abov norm profit or direct budgetari subsidi accord to calcul by the institut of nation econom forecast of the russian academi of scienc made on the basi of appropri model the overal rate of inflat as the result of such measur mai be reduc to 8 to 10 percent per month over thi period 2 to 3 month the price in other sector move closer to the norm relationship for the produc sell their product at free price progress taxat is introduc for abov norm profit sanction for evad the tax ar toughen there is revalu of fix capit or index of amort allot with tougher condit for their us tax exempt ar introduc for part of the profit be us for accumul of fix capit as a result of all the measur be propos the level of inflat mai be reduc to 3 to 5 percent per month in 4 to 5 month probabl other method of regul price and stop inflat ar possibl as well in the event that the concept of regul itself is adopt the scientist and specialist of the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund ar prepar to take part in develop a mechan for it implement but at the same time it should be rememb that disregard the problem of price in the nation economi and postpon it solut is fraught with veri seriou consequ which mai turn out to be irrevers time dictat the necess of rais thi problem and search for a solut without delai there is no question that the procedur for adjust price to effici relationship is extrem complic it requir veri painstak and skill work when effici price relationship ar work out it is essenti to bear in mind that the world correl ar not suitabl for us now but the relationship of pre reform 1990 ar not satisfactori either inasmuch as thei will be plai a protect role with respect to obsolet technolog it appear that a balanc between the stimul role of price proport and the rel financi prosper of most of industri is provid by the relationship of price found between the current correl and those of 1990 so the plan is to first establish a certain effici correl of price with the aid of a definit select includ administr measur and then add on the entir system of econom regul to these correl over sever month in addit the psycholog factor plai an extraordinarili import role a step such as thi relat to the regul of some price is a kind of signal to all person in the market that the state is take the game to itself and is prepar to deliber and purposefulli shape the kei cost and price proport for a definit period of time the chang in price proport be propos and the avail of signific unutil capac in our economi ar still not suffici condit for stabil product and start the movement toward growth in order to reach thi goal an entir packag of measur will need to be implement includ the follow support for the solvenc of

reform in 1992 when the shock method obvious predomin in the govern s foreign econom polici the cutback in foreign trade turnov took place at an even faster pace than the product recess the total volum of foreign trade turnov in 1992 wa 76 billion and it wa reduc by 24 percent compar with the previou year in 1993 the volum of foreign trade turnov wa r76 2 billion sic that is it remain at the

increas the physic amount of commod be export primarili energi resourc when there wa a declin of 15 percent in contract price for them but the main point is that just as in 1992 the composit of export

turn for the wors the polici of attract foreign invest which could have had a signific effect in promot invest activ in the economi if it had been success prove to be underproduct as well accord to certain data the total volum of foreign invest in russia wa about r7 billion as of 1 juli 1993 thi is an extrem small amount the currenc polici prove to be ineffect dure the reform acceler introduct

currenc market and exchang is be accumul howev the shock method of introduc domest rubl convert when there is an inadequ econom organiz legal and method foundat inevit led to the rapid declin of the rubl s exchang rate repeat assur by the govern in 1992 to stabil the rubl s exchang rate initi at the level of 20 to 30 rubl to the dollar and then 80 rubl turn out to be incompet and evid were count on intern monetari fund resourc to form a stabil fund of 6 billion which were not obtain in 1993 russia came out with an exchang rate of more than r400 to the dollar and it continu to drop exceed the

dollar s posit in the economi and cultiv insecur in the public conscious about the nation currenc and avoid of it in perspect if the govern s currenc polici is not revis all these harm consequ for the economi will not onli be retain but intensifi and final in assess the foreign econom aspect of the russian reform we cannot limit thi sphere to distant foreign countri after the collaps of the ussr the countri of the near abroad ar now russia s main foreign market with a concentr of about 60 percent of it total foreign trade turnov and it is veri import that thi is a market where it product ar competit howev thi is a more unstabl and less regul market in which price payment and settlement and other instrument for it regul still differ from those accept in world practic as a result there is a continu cutback in mutual ti which is on of the main reason for the product recess in everi on of the new state without except commod exchang within just the ci declin by nearli on half in 1992 compar with the previou year thi trend continu in 1993 a threaten shortsight reorient of russian export from countri of the near abroad to more distant countri is under wai thi is shown particularli clearli in the chang geographi of energi resourc export export of russian energi resourc to the near abroad and more distant co untri over 11 month total export increas or decreas in expo rt compar with same period in 1992 in percent to the near abroad to more distant c ountri oil in million 117 1 38 24 3 of metric ton ga in billion 155 7 72 6 4 3 of cubic meter coal in million 24 3 54 7 7 4 of metric ton without the transit of turkmen ga similar process ar be observ in the export polici of other ci countri especi turkmenistan kazakhstan uzbekistan ukrain and belaru which mai turn into heavi loss of market for russian industri primarili it process sector there is no altern but to reintegr the economi of the ci countri in our view thi is in russia s interest as well as those of the ci countri recognit of thi object necess wa express in the ci countri declar on establish of the econom union howev the extens polit activ displai in thi direct will not have real econom result unless a realist and balanc program of practic action is place under thi document there is no such program at present primari attent in draft it should be devot to solut of the follow question in our view first substanti for a model of an open economi as appli to the specif characterist of russia and it new geopolit posit and most importantli determin of the strategi and tactic for reach the goal set by stage the question of develop the process of the open of russia s economi by stage is import and fundament shock method as well as attempt to restor strict administr measur appli under the influenc of transitori interest should be exclud in all stage in actual polici at the same time and thi is import to stress foreign econom polici should have it own constant social compon in all the stage second the question of open and econom secur under the new market condit thi question is much more complic and cover a much broader scale than befor obvious the object now is to protect insur russia s entir reproduct mechan from possibl unfavor influenc of world market condit and to ensur that activ in the russian market by domest and foreign econom entiti conform to overal state interest third a kei question in foreign econom polici ha been and continu to be the develop of export and reinforc of their foundat in the strateg plan export polici should be aim at sell commod in the foreign market when the countri ha intern advantag at bring out domest enterpris for competit with foreign firm and at increas the seri product scale of domest output in order to push it out into foreign market it is obviou howev that select of a futur export basket and the industri of export cannot proce spontan it is equal import that we not postpon creation of a modern mechan of state support for export export credit guarante risk insur and incent for russian invest abroad includ those base on the sale of debt asset which will be abl to form a basi for the countri s particip in intern product and the infrastructur to move domest product into foreign market on a practic level it is necessari to further liber export minim the applic of quota and licens and greatli simplifi the licens procedur thi is especi import for those commod which ar not sold in a reduc domest market in the near futur we must sharpli limit the fiscal function of export export duti which is total inappropri for them and later on to the extent that there is a chang in the level and structur of domest price it should be complet elimin final it is essenti to put the export themselv in order organization and elimin the element of unprofession anarchi and competit between russian firm fourth the import polici need to be fundament revis at the strateg level import polici should be aim at suppli the countri with product which provid technic and econom advantag over domest product which modern the product potenti which enrich the suppli of consum good in the domest market and which suppli us with product which ar not turn out in the countri for the purpos of stabil it appear to be absolut necessari to maintain critic central import for state need medicin food and complet unit for the near futur 5 feb p 3 text the main practic task is to creat a system of import tariff regul that ha been reason out thoroughli which perform a threefold function optim of import regul of competit and provis for budgetari interest for thi the govern need to be absolut clear about which vital import sector of the economi must be protect which area of foreign competit should be regul and where it should be complet open to stimul the competit of domest product fifth the nucleu of the new currenc polici ha been and continu to be achiev of real rubl convert in principl the accomplish of thi task cannot lead to ani object or doubt but it cannot and should not be done separ but on the basi of stabil of the economi and the state s financ and balanc of payment not all at onc but in stage for thi reason in recogn that the cours toward achiev of real rubl convert is strateg we believ that in the period under review the problem doe not mean artifici acceler thi process but put in order the system of domest rubl convert which is now be speed up as a stage in the transit to it real convert exchang rate format and the establish of effici currenc relationship between the state and jurid and physic person is the central problem here we ar proceed from the convict that there can be no direct return to the currenc monopoli of the past and artifici isol of the rubl s exchang rate from the market howev it is absolut essenti to limit the destruct effect of stock exchang specul on the exchang rate and to put the mechan for set the exchang rate in good order on a practic level the follow altern for a solut mai be consid here the essenc of the first altern is to introduc 100 percent of the compulsori sale of currenc earn in the market thi is an old idea but it will not produc the desir effect under current condit the essenc of the second altern which we consid prefer in thi stage is to temporarili refus to recogn the stock exchang s rate of exchang for the rubl as the offici rate the central bank of the russian feder could determin the offici rate of exchang in the indic of the actual price proport of russian export and import and us thi as the account rate in all area cover by state currenc regul in calcul tax custom duti and fee in determin the rubl cost of central import in evalu fix capit and foreign invest and final in reflect the foreign currenc which bank and enterpris report in their account and the particip by foreign in privat such an offici exchang rate could be adjust regularli depend on the exchang rate of foreign currenc be held to which it would be expedi to attach the dynam of domest price for good and servic as well real support for the offici exchang rate and expans of stock exchang trade in currenc would be a chang in the current system of currenc central name substitut of the compulsori sale of 50 percent of export earn by a currenc tax of 15 to 20 percent on it leav the remain currenc at the export dispos in perspect both exchang rate will draw togeth to the extent that an authent currenc market is develop and condit will therebi appear for the us of a singl real market rate of exchang offici quot by the tsbr central bank of russia and the shift to a system of 100 percent currenc sale the version be propos remov or limit all the harm consequ of the convert analyz abov sixth the polici of attract foreign invest requir drastic revis the accent here should be on attract privat foreign invest as on of the strateg direct of russia s foreign econom polici in the forese futur foreign privat capit bring in advanc technolog and modern manag it expand the capit accumul and it contribut to develop of the export base and import replac without increas the state s foreign debt in the process which is extrem import under current condit seventh question of foreign indebted and the us of russia s foreign debt asset the accumul foreign debt weigh heavili on russia s foreign econom relat howev the specif natur of russia is that it is a major intern creditor at the same time it is highli unlik that both of these debt can be settl by tradit method it ha becom necessari to adopt nonstandard form of settl the countri s liabil and realiz it debt asset take world practic into account thi problem mai be resolv in the follow wai repay of the debt by payment of coordin compens with a discount from the nomin amount convers of the debt into invest in it economi or the debtor s economi the sale of debt asset liabil in a secondari market and reciproc credit for liabil the possibl of larg scale reciproc credit for russia s debt liabil and asset mai be consid with the particip of the intern monetari fund and the pari and london club eighth the problem of relationship between the feder and the region in foreign econom matter is a sore point there ar still quit a number of area in disput here the most import wai to put thi entir system in good order first of all is by simplifi it central regul as sensibl as possibl and free it of unnecessari red tape which would automat remov the question of shift a number of farfetch regulatori function to subject of the feder at the structur level when there is a unifi foreign econom polici the feder s subject could have the opportun at their level to choos a sound export import special for a region develop a foreign econom infrastructur and attract foreign invest provid investor with local benefit within the limit of their compet togeth with thi feder subject should have their own market commod to export for region need their own currenc reserv includ those for social purpos and receiv a definit share of the feder incom from foreign trade origin in their territori ninth the cours toward reintegr of the former union republ and format of an econom union of the ci countri over the long term and from the standpoint of russia s state interest is most import and a top prioriti ani other approach depriv russia of initi and author in the reintegr process at the same time a ci econom union canot be decre or introduc through shock therapi by reli on the other countri depend on russia it establish can onli be a voluntari process with it own stage and possibl it ebb and flow solut of the question of the ci countri settlement and payment relationship is most import among the urgent practic task all the attempt or their semblanc to form rubl zone of variou type have fail there is littl hope that the differ attach to the russian rubl by on or two state will be effect in the current stage a realist and reliabl path is to form a payment union of ci countri on a multicurr basi base on the nation currenc of the ci state immedi solut of the follow matter is requir for thi the principl and procedur for coordin the exchang rate of nation currenc the procedur for equal the balanc of account between the countri bank and reciproc convert of nation currenc and the us of on of them the rubl as a collect payment and reserv capit a matter of no less import is the presenc of a stage preced a complet payment union name a clear union whose oper should be entrust to the interst bank of the ci which ha been establish the restor of control of the economi the almost complet loss of the economi s control ha becom an extraordinarili danger aspect of the current situat the countri ha enter a deepen manag crisi there is practic no state structur remain which ha not lost it author and been depriv of real lever of influenc on the process take place in the economi it is a paradox fact that loss of the economi s control is take place against the background of a sharp increas in the size of the manag apparatu and an increas in bureaucraci in the process of prepar and make decis corrupt in govern structur is intensifi rapidli it is imposs not to see that paralysi of the manag

obviou oversimplif of the task of manag russia s most complic product and scientif and technic potenti is be permit everywher inasmuch as the solut of all the problem in effici econom oper is be erron

out of the crisi and continu the reform construct can be perform without overcom the organiz confus and rectifi the defect and disord in the manag mechan without delai the vacuum of author which ha taken shape should be complet fill by rehabilit the principl of state regul and by substanti increas the level of control of the economi in thi connect top prioriti should be given to regul the procedur for the us of feder properti thi mean clear cut definit of the limit of the state sector of the economi the divis of russian state properti and the right to dispos of it between the feder and

retain by the russian feder govern which can deleg a number of power to ministri and depart as well as to the organ of execut author of feder subject we cannot continu to resign ourselv to the fact that ministri and depart have essenti been taken out of the process of reshap enterpris their privat format of the vital import market infrastructur and influenc on the consum market the role of the

econom associ and consortium with the initi and lead role of the state a special role should be plai by hold compani whose asset includ control block of stock in other enterpris a kei role in increas the level of control is plai by coordin and stabil in the distribut of power between the feder and it subject it is fundament import to actual transfer the power set forth in the russian feder

state properti in the interest of increas the level of control and expediti solut of current socioeconom problem it is expedi for the region to have represent attach to the govern so the analysi of the current econom situat in russia conduct by the depart of econom of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund show that the market reform did not produc the chang desir over the 2 year period thi wa not the result of individu error and miscalcul but a cours which wa chosen erron from the begin to creat a liber market economi by shock and monetarist method the economi is in a critic state the social base of the reform be conduct ha been sharpli reduc continu of the cours chosen will lead the countri to a dead end for thi reason we reiter that thi is not a matter of adjust the cours that ha been chosen but of work out new approach to the strategi and tactic of socioeconom reform in russia we have propos a conceptu view of them 8 feb p 3 text the econom reform be conduct

the state wherea onli 16 8 percent plan to bui hous immedi 13 8 percent will continu to live with rel for that reason bear in mind the fact that kazakh of the diaspora in mongolia ar poorli provid for materi we must make special effort when materi assist is organ through state and social organ we must devot attent to learn the nativ kazakh languag and to the consolid of a linguist environ thi is becaus the number of kazakh peopl in the region of kazakhstan is low for exampl accord to 1989 figur 27 2 percent of the peopl in eastern kazakhstan oblast ar kazakh 17 2 percent of the peopl in qaraghandi oblast ar kazakh and the repres of the russian peopl 52 2 percent sic thi be the case we must not forget that 22 3 and 17 2 percent respect of mongolian kazakh wish to migrat have express an interest in settl in these oblast if the entir kazakh popul of mongolia were to migrat there is no question that thi would lead to a radic chang in the nation demographi of kazakhstan the reason is

latvian wai and farmer union will save the latvian peopl protect them from further assimil into the mass of foreign immigr or promot the welfar of the nativ peopl of latvia in my opinion the most danger section of the bill is chapter 2 on natur quota which ar to be determin everi year by the govern it look like we have miss the train onc again becaus at present just like dure the stagnat year of the recent past larg number of foreign citizen ar arriv in latvia everi dai some of them honest and dishonest ar attempt to legal their stai in latvia us variou mean other who have been success in

to leav sign a statement that he will leav the territori of latvia within a seven dai period and continu to walk to street of riga becaus the polic structur ha not creat a mechan through which thi matter could be follow up the procedur for issu a visa in accord with resolut 90 pass by the council of minist of the republ of latvia on februari 19 1993 ani citizen of latvia or ani foreign who is

to visit of cours approxim on half of riga s resid ar foreign who illeg enter latvia dure the soviet era and almost everyon of them ha a vast circl of friend and rel in the ci countri these foreign regist in latvia make up the major of our client it should be ad that recent for reason unknown the latvian mass media and along with thi also the public have popular the term perman resid which is us to describ citizen of the ussr live in latvia thi term is total mislead becaus such a concept is not contain in ani legisl act of the republ of latvia nor ha ani such categori of person been defin for whom such a term could be appli for legal purpos all of these peopl who from june 17 1940 up until juli 1 1992 illeg i e against the wish of the latvian citizenship bodi enter latvia to take up resid contain in their passport the inform that thei ar citizen or subject of the union of soviet socialist republ as we know for mani intern right question after 1991 the legal heir to the ussr is russia which is why the bodi of peopl describ could be consid as citizen of russia of cours provid that thei do not poss document prove citizenship of anoth countri in ani case these peopl have the statu of foreign in latvia not of perman resid furthermor when a latvian citizen or foreign regist in latvia ha complet the invit the visa depart confirm it and on the basi of thi document the latvian embassi abroad receiv entri visa for privat visit a privat visa is issu for a request period of time but not longer than for 3 month in a normal situat the foreign return home to hi perman countri of resid at the end of the privat visit unfortun the situat here is complet differ larg number of foreign enter latvia everi dai and after expir of the visa intend for their visit attempt by whatev mean to gain the right to remain perman in latvia what is so attract about latvia for foreign it is our disorgan legisl and economi if the person who ha enter latvia is success in extend the visa or receiv a

foreign who ha come here is veri quickli hire by some privat compani regist in latvia usual as a procur agent becaus the compani need peopl with a wide circl of acquaint or extens contact in russia and other ci countri these foreign continu travel to the ci countri back and forth bring in variou good and sell them in latvia for inflat price everi dai larg number of foreign arriv in latvia for 3 month and can be rel easili divid into 4 group the first group is numer the largest and includ foreign who live in latvia and their spous who ar citizen of other countri and arriv to join their famili and to remain to live in latvia although a major of those who come own apart and even hous in russia ci these person ar ignor the law adopt by our state on foreign and those who ar not citizen of ani countri who arriv and remain in the republ of latvia which went into effect on juli 1 1992 and the regul confirm by the council of minist on mai 19 of thi year on the issu of permit for stai these legisl act state that permit for stai must be obtain by all foreign who wish to remain in latvia for more than 3 month and that these permit must be request from the latvian embassi or consular offic consul abroad the spous of foreign take an easier road of defianc again through falsif and ly that thei ar onli come for a visit thei request an entri visa for 3 month and after spend a pleasant time within their famili circl thei give notic that thei ar not go anywher becaus thi is where their wife or husband and children ar it turn out that prior to arriv here the foreign left hi job and offici gave up the previou place of resid thu the poor person ha nowher to go the foreign ar go around from pontiu to pilat to show that thei ar be discrimin against those who come here ar not concern about unemploy nor about not know the state languag nor their lack of a legal mean of support the court system which should be protect the interest and right of citizen of the republ of latvia is involv with examin the complaint of those who have come here illeg foreign ar now su not onli to receiv the resid registri stamp in their passport but also to legal the presenc of their spous in latvia i haven t heard about ani case be brought to court concern the activ of dishonest worker in the resid registri of the latgal or vidzem suburb who have receiv monei to regist foreign as resid or citizen when in fact thei ar not qualifi to be regist as such the second is an elderli group consist of mother and father who have come from russia or the ci to visit their well situat children foreign regist in latvia and remain here to live also thi group of travel should have appli for permit of stai at the embassi befor come over but thei have request visit visa for a period of 3 month and cross the latvian boarder afterward their children obtain from clinic and hospit either legal or fictiv doctor note which ar not valid neither by the acknowledg of the commiss of physician nor by the signatur and stamp of the chief physician sometim it is a mysteri of how these peopl manag to come to latvia while suffer with such an arrai of diseas what is interest is that within 3 month their diseas and chronic condit have progress so sever that these peopl ar prevent from leav it can be assum that these peopl ar not concern with the problem of pension nor ani other type of hardship the children of these old peopl ar persist in their fight to receiv the permit of stai the third group includ foreign who come to latvia supposedli on a visit but ar actual here to engag in marriag and remain to live in latvia unfortun in accord with the present legisl a foreign who is in latvia on a visa can regist for marriag if someon who ha just come here marri a citizen of latvia in accord with the immigr law thi person can request and obtain a permit of stai for on year after which it can be extend to 4 year and after 5 year receiv a permit for perman stai veri often the marriag between person of foreign nation and citizen of latvia ar fictiv conclud for the purpos of obtain a permit to stai in latvia obvious in a situat where the incom for the major of citizen of latvia border on minimum subsist citizen ar forc to agre to such fictiv marriag in order to earn some addit incom in practic our worker have come upon the situat where on marri spous doe not know the other spous s date of birth residenti address or even the proper spell of the last name in mani case the spous retain their own last name the fourth group consist of polit and econom refuge from ci hot spot thei join rel or friend here hide the true reason for come and often mention contract for work or studi in latvia as the reason for their propos stai in latvia in thi respect i would like to examin the riga civil aviat univers thi institut is a magnet for foreign thi alma mater attract a larg number of student from the transcaucasian republ who arriv here with their entir famili wive children father mother i cannot neglect to mention that there ar also quit a few aspir student from the countri of the near and far east who dure the school semest attempt to regist marriag with citizen of latvia also fictiv marriag i would like to know what sort of specialist thi univers is train if even dure the studi period or immedi after complet studi thei ar regist compani in the republ of latvia busi registri with twenti or thirti dollar or so in their pocket to start busi activ it seem that no on at present can tell how mani firm and limit liabil compani ar regist under the roof of thi univers what thei ar

point of view i believ that my govern should strive to promot research in high technolog in which japan is said to lag behind other nation i think that to that end it is necessari to promot basic

from that point i plan to promot truli meaning intern exchang under which japan accept 100 000 foreign student for studi here next there is the inform industri which mai be a typic exampl of an econom area fill with creativ thank to fast progress in inform commun technolog it will becom possibl earli in the 21st centuri for peopl to watch program all over the world at ani time and to even receiv medic and administr servic at home it will becom necessari to push for overal deregul of the commun sector to enabl acceler improv of exist network and the launch of new project by privat busi but it is never easi to realiz such an invigor and abund societi it take so mani financi resourc to implement social secur program and to improv social overhead capit while aim to creat a creativ fill societi no doubt necessari cost and respons should be share among us in a fair and appropri manner without that it will be imposs to realiz the societi we seek to be in by the 21st centuri to ensur that societi doe not lose it vital from high tax burden we ar resolv to contain the peopl s burden to below 50 percent even at the ag popul s peak time in the 21st centuri we must think hard and come up with the best possibl idea we must implement administr reform with an emphasi on deregul as well as fundament revis of govern expenditur my govern should boldli relax regul which will gener the maximum effect in area close ti to peopl s live like distribut hous and land new type of busi like inform commun and industri which will contribut to expand employ even when these effort ar made howev i think that if an abund and invigor societi is to be realiz in the 21st centuri some increas in individu tax burden will be unavoid right now on senior citizen is support by five work citizen but when our ag societi peak on senior citizen will be support by onli two work citizen simpli put the burden will more than doubl no doubt we must also think about increas social secur insur premium with a further ag popul and increas tax burden to improv social overhead capit if we look at the exist tax system from such a viewpoint becaus the weight of individu incom tax in the tax system is so larg so much of the burden need to be born by the gener of work peopl if the present condit is allow to continu it will excess task the gener support the ag societi if the willing of the work gener and the vigor of the societi as a whole ar to be fulli maintain it will becom necessari to reconsid the burden of the peopl and to bring a tax system which ensur a balanc between incom consumpt and asset as such i have come to think the best choic given to us is to push for a tax system reform with a nation consensu along the line of the tax reform polici recommend by the tax commiss which is aim at realiz a fair and invigor societi of the ag popul i would like to have the nation s understand on thi lastli i would like to speak about intern affair japan s prosper is onli possibl if the world s free trade system is maintain i believ that the recent conclus of the uruguai round is truli signific it is a matter of cours for my govern to give full consider to the impact of the round s conclus in particular my govern will take measur to enabl farmer to engag in farm free of concern i believ the govern must take measur to ensur the futur of the farmer and thu prevent the nation s food self suffici rate from further drop listen to voic from other nation japan is still close japan s save ar too high while it invest ar too small japan is critic for that needless to sai some of such critic is base on misunderstand but we have to vigor improv what need to be improv the aggress upgrad of the current infrastructur to prepar for a societi of senior citizen is not for the sake of other nation but for the sake of ourselv to do that we need to secur revenu resourc which will not leav excess burden to the futur gener onc that is done i think we will have to review the basic plan on public work invest includ possibl revis and increas of the invest alloc i am convinc that we will be abl to build japan s econom societi into on that is open to other nation through the cours of implement those polici of cours the econom and social reform be propos here ar not someth that can be done by the govern alon and all reform accompani pain besid the choic we can take ar veri limit i hope we will be abl to challeng difficulti with the cooper of the peopl and build an ag which is full of ideal of hope by share pain among all of us with the so call econom bubbl have gone and with inventori have undergon readjust thi is the year when the economi should recov in full scale i am confid that we will have a good econom new year if we move toward the vision present todai while do the best in overcom the immedi issu of the economi i prai that thi year mai be a fruit year for all of you the peopl of the nation thank you report then we would like to begin ask question first mr prime minist i would like to ask thi question in connect with the vision you talk about just now talk about the tax system reform you have said that the reform would not mean simpli rais or lower tax rate and that you would present a vision so i assum the vision you mention todai is the vision you have said wa forthcom bluntli put can i sai that you ar ask the peopl to understand that an increas in the consumpt tax is unavoid hosokawa no i did not mean to refer to the consumpt tax rate issu the vision for the 21st centuri is as the word sai the vision for the 21st centuri i present a long term view on what the futur econom societi should look like with the ag popul an increas in tax burden is unavoid if we choos to avoid increas burden then we will have no choic but to reduc social secur benefit on the other hand if we choos to reli on debt while that mai be all right with the peopl of our gener it will result in leav mani burden to our children and grandchildren if the work gener bear excess burden with the popul ag proceed there will aris the question of whether societi s vital can be maintain or the question of whether the work gener will not lose their will to work despit that when we think about thi point it becom clear we have to consid as point out in the tax commiss s recommend and the hiraiwa commiss s report about the relationship between the interest and burden of the peopl and about the tax system which can ensur balanc between incom asset and consumpt as such i present in the vision my view on how the peopl s interest and benefit should be balanc report i would like to ask onc again todai you said you will push for an overal tax system reform base on the nation consensu could you have us that express with the reduct of incom tax and the increas of consumpt tax in the futur in mind hosokawa i mai be repeat what i said just now with the ag societi arriv an increas in burden will be unavoid i think it will be irrespons to avoid bear the increas burden the consult committe of the govern and rule parti is now discuss what specif we should do from a broad perspect in consider of the tax commiss s recommend by the time the 1994 budget is formul in mid or late januari the committe will come up with a conclus the govern will make a decis after see the committe s conclus report you did not make yourself clear on the question of the consumpt tax increas but accord to the vision you present you want to go for an overal tax system reform base on the tax commiss s recommend i think it is clear what you want to sai realli wa that there is no choic but to rais the consumpt tax rate in the futur the reason you cannot speak clearli about it is becaus the social democrat parti of japan sdpj is strongli oppos to it i would like to ask if you can convinc the sdpj hosokawa that is a tough question i think there ar sever prerequisit for promot a comprehens tax system reform for exampl we must ration expenditur and correct unfair practic in taxat among these prerequisit a drastic review of the balanc between direct and indirect tax is on of the biggest issu relat to the nation s comprehens tax reform regard the govern s conclus on the issu howev i must repeat that is still under debat among the coalit parti the consult committe compos of all parti is discuss the matter sinc the burden ar unavoid i think the committe will come to some sort of conclus report mr prime minist it seem your statement todai focus on mid and long term govern task howev in your new year s statement i think the public want to hear your stanc toward emerg pump prime measur what is your actual plan for the new pump prime packag hosokawa with respect to econom measur the govern ha alreadi hammer out sever pump prime packag and through the third supplementari budget for fiscal 1993 and the initi budget for fiscal 1994 we ar go to implement ceaseless econom stimulu measur to cover the come 15 month our budget formul work give much consider to stimul of the economi and it will certainli brighten the japanes economi s futur by the time the 1994 budget is formul econom measur will becom fix and i certainli hope the measur will meet the peopl s expect report in connect with the previou question on the peopl s greatest concern could you tell me the size of the incom tax reduct and it revenu resourc hosokawa i cannot give an answer to that at thi point the govern and the rule parti ar discuss the matter now i think a conclus will shape up by the middl of januari report you have just state that the govern will take action to secur employ of worker over 65 year old as a mid to long term task howev the unemploy rate is gradual pick up nationwid and the number of jobless is increas in the busi sector in thi regard how much do you estim the nation s unemploy and econom growth rate in 1994 will be hosokawa the govern is schedul to announc it econom forecast in mid januari in definit figur concern employ secur measur i have repeatedli said in diet interpel that the govern is try it best to draw up measur for secur employ at the labor ministri s initi in fact employ condit ar becom seriou in the nation and i am realli concern about the present circumst as i note in my new year s statement and a previou new confer the govern intend to deal with employ relat issu with everi possibl measur i am serv as the chairman of the govern s employ polici headquart to fulli engag in the task report mr prime minist my question is again about the govern s tax reduct plan chairman hiroshi kato of the advisori tax system research council met with you yesterdai and insist that the govern should promis a futur increas of the consumpt tax if the incom tax is implement thi fiscal year in other word he said a bill for incom tax cut should includ a pledg on a futur increas of the consumpt tax rate while you take a stanc to attach import to tax panel polici ar you realli go to enact the incom tax cut and the consumpt tax hike at the same time hosokawa as a matter of cours we have to attach much import to the tax panel s opinion but the govern s attitud toward the panel s advisori report is also under debat at the consult committe organ by the coalit parti the committe will determin the coalit s tax reform polici hopefulli in consider of the tax panel s advisori report report in the statement s conclus you said the busi climat will improv thi year after the stock adjust phase when we assess if the stock adjust phase is well under wai we must pai attent to the fact that financi institut bad loan ar on of the main reason for the prolong recess thi is a signific differ from the preced recess so some peopl ar question if the govern ha the proper remedi for the stagnant economi thei sai the govern must have drastic and unusu remedi such as larg scale public invest and incom tax cut with the issuanc of deficit cover bond what is your attitud toward such an opinion hosokawa i have repeatedli note that we must be veri care of thoughtless depend on deficit cover bond on the other hand the govern is serious seek measur to encourag transact of real estat while we have no definit plan right now we ar try veri hard to seiz some good idea report again on the consumpt tax mr prime minist it seem you intend to wait for the coalit parti discuss to end but you will have to make your own decis sooner or later do you have the resolv to demonstr your leadership to make a futur orient decis on tax revenu hosokawa i am veri sorri but i cannot answer that question at thi point take into account a conclus drawn by the coalit parti i would like to make a proper decis for the futur report to cope with the ag societi you have clarifi your stanc to ask heavier burden of the public to improv servic for the ag it is necessari to reinforc manpow to work on thi field on the other hand the govern is expect to have more manpow through deregul polici do you intend to minim the public s burden by util the surplu manpow to overcom bureaucrat section hosokawa that is an interest idea but i have no definit plan yet report your statement includ guidelin on variou issu howev it mai be difficult to carri them out under bureaucrat section while the statement advoc administr reform how will you draw up definit measur hosokawa as a matter of cours individu ministri and agenc ar primarili in charg and outlin of reform plan ar introduc to the coalit parti leader thei will thoroughli discuss administr reform and it detail will be materi in the 1994 budget and other govern polici of cours propos in my statement ar base on ministri polici such as econom program the five year plan for improv social infrastructur and the nation develop plan also the hiraiwa commiss and the

tangibl measur for carri out administr reform base on my principl report pleas let me ask again on thi point sinc the financ ministri and the sdpj ar not in accord on the treatment of the consumpt tax your leadership as prime minist is like to be strongli expect on thi issu could you explain your resolv again hosokawa needless to sai i have to make final decis regardless of whether it is a matter of rice or someth els anyhow it is an import issu we have to find a desir balanc between receiv benefit and share burden anyhow as i have said earlier our societi is ag and it is unavoid that the work peopl s burden will grow heavier under such a circumst some peopl mai sai that thei do not want to shoulder the burden other mai sai that thei do not want to see a further declin in social secur

you go to do if the reform bill ar not approv hosokawa i cannot disclos what i am plan to do there ar mani thing that i am think about report you have cancel your plan trip to europ japan us summit talk will be held in februari can you give us an outlin of your diplomat schedul for thi year hosokawa japan us summit talk will be held in februari deal with the japan us comprehens econom consult is a veri difficult task we ar now do our best to deal with the negoti which ar veri difficult as a major topic the result of the consult will probabl be confirm at the upcom japan us summit talk other than that i have no urgent diplomat plan for the time be of cours summit of the group of seven develop countri will be held in juli howev i have no concret diplomat plan for the period between now and juli report reportedli you were invit to visit china ar you plan to visit china hosokawa i have receiv an invit from china and from some european countri but i have not decid yet on a concret schedul report i will ask you question about a total differ matter it is regard 100 million yen you borrow from the sagawa group the opposit parti ar determin to ask you question on thi matter at the diet meet right after new year s dai do you think that the document which you submit earlier to both lower and upper hous is enough to explain the situat also ar you not plan to correct what wa written in the document hosokawa i am earnestli try to see if i can submit someth addit at thi moment i cannot sai for sure whether or not i will be abl to submit anyth els howev i believ that the document i submit earlier dispel the doubt that i did not pai back the monei howev i heard some peopl ar still suspici therefor i am try to see if i can submit addit document report in addit to a doubt regard whether or not you have paid back the monei some peopl suspect that the monei wa us toward expens for your gubernatori elect thei suspect that the monei wa not us in the wai you have explain can you comment on thi hosokawa as i repeatedli explain at the diet i did not borrow the monei to us for polit purpos report i would like to ask you again a question regard the consumpt tax it sound to me as if you were sai at the begin of your speech that you had no choic but to increas the consumpt tax rate i think what you said wa not veri clear to the peopl either you have been sai that you had entrust the rule parti with studi the consumpt tax issu do you not think that the peopl would have a clear understand if you explain to them that the govern ha no choic but to increas the consumpt tax sooner or later hosokawa i understand what you mean but it will be like put the cart befor the hors if i explain my idea and show a certain direct befor the rule parti come up with their propos in their meet the rule parti ar studi variou choic the peopl can make i am of the opinion that i should make my final decis after the rule parti come up with their propos report concern an incom tax cut you repeatedli said sinc last autumn that you want to wait for discuss on the issu and a report to be work out by the tax reform council but all of a sudden in decemb you express a plan to set up the rule parti econom affair consult council to ask the council to discuss the incom tax cut issu in thi connect howev mana kubota director gener of the econom plan agenc said in a new confer that a polit decis should be made on thi issu there is a voic among the peopl that you lack leadership and that the govern ha miss the time of carri out the incom tax cut how do you answer thi view hosokawa well i fulli understand that the peopl greatli expect the govern to carri out the incom tax cut but as i have repeatedli mention earlier if we carri out the incom tax cut without secur the revenu sourc the next gener will have to pai for it and i do not think thi is desir for that reason my view is that we need to serious studi thi issu i know that the situat will be more seriou if we miss the opportun with thi in mind i think it is necessari to promot discuss on thi issu while seek the rule parti understand report mr prime minist you have constantli said that the excess issuanc of deficit cover bond is undesir it is probabl ideal for the govern to includ both the tax cut and tax hike in the govern s draft bill on tax reform but assum that the govern fail to includ the tax cut and hike in it bill but instead reach an agreement with the rule coalit to issu short term bond to make up for a loss caus by the tax cut do you think the issuanc of deficit cover bond under the agreement among the rule parti is still undesir hosokawa i am ask the rule coalit to strain their wit to studi thi issu includ the possibl issuanc of short term deficit cover bond and i also hope that thei will come up with some idea report i think you probabl have difficulti in adjust polici with the rule parti and ministri or agenc concern but i think that not onli the report here but also the peopl feel that your polit stanc is chang now from your origin posit wherein you said that you would show your polici to the peopl in a straightforward manner i think thi is why the peopl think you lack leadership in solv issu includ the issu of cut tax and rais the consumpt tax how do you consid your current posit hosokawa i know what you ar sai but i am requir to manag the govern in the unpreced polit situat wherein the eight parti form a coalit on the rice issu i gave my utmost to the veri limit to obtain consensu from member of the rule parti to prevent japan from be isol from the intern commun from my offic i repeatedli call gatt director gener sutherland and ask him to wait for anoth on or two hour while wait for an agreement among the rule parti so eventu as you know i made a decis on the partial open of the rice market if i should make ani decis without discuss among the rule parti the coalit govern compos of the eight parti would collaps i do not think it is desir to break the coalit govern i fulli understand that the peopl ar eager to see my earli decisionmak in the past the cabinet wa allow to solv issu on by on howev mani issu ar simultan fall upon the current coalit govern i think that even when it wa the on parti rule by the liber democrat parti there must have been sharp debat within the parti on such difficult issu but now exchang of sharp debat within the govern is inevit becaus the coalit govern is form by eight parti given such a situat what i can do is to promot discuss among the rule parti to reflect the peopl s expect in the govern s polici as much as possibl and then make a decis while seek possibl compromis among the rule parti so thi is what i want the peopl to understand report there is the view that the hosokawa govern is attach import onli to domest issu and ignor it relat with the unit state what do you think of thi hosokawa as i said earlier japan and the unit state ar face veri difficult econom issu howev i think that through the previou two meet the presid and i have further deepen our understand that the basic relat between japan and the unit state have been plai a great role in the world and the intern commun the issu concern the japan us econom framework talk need to be immedi solv for exampl prioriti is given to such microeconom issu as auto and auto part govern procur insur and wai to beef up the us compani competit power the japanes govern is face too mani difficult issu but asid from these issu the govern is make effort to provid good result regard the import issu between japan and the unit state by the time a summit is held in februari although the issu mai not be solv perfectli i think we have to come to some conclus which both japan and the unit state can accept presid clinton and i also have fulli confirm it is signific and import to deepen firm bilater relat in the intern commun and accomplish global cooper in solv such issu as environment protect and measur to cope with the grow world popul and aid other than the immedi microeconom issu and i understand that our view remain unchang dean of the press corp time ha come now to close the prime minist s new year new confer thank you veri much

psycholog stereotyp and the veri tenor of the life of societi and each person individu we have all todai come in for a dual load as it were it is as though both the economi and societi find themselv

mere deton societi and lead to civil war it is no less import to recogn that the ubiquit assert myth of social of the kind we experienc have collaps not onli in the ci but throughout the world despit a number of achiev of thi system us and realiz in practic we cannot finish up at a histor dead end yet again anoth direct of social thought put the emphasi on tradit and nation charact the ideolog of

profoundli moral and spiritu in the life of each peopl tradit their role in the life of the peopl is indisput cultur tradit have alwai been a sourc of social reviv a return to on s histor cultur root is of cours a posit process in addit it is necessari to abandon the simplist interpret of the relationship of tradit and social progress the experi of the modern world show convincingli that certain

chang of the modern world develop of the nation languag art cultur everydai cultur includ and the famili is entir support in kazakhstan but the polit ideolog of the tradit type which is base on a resuscit of archaic form of social arrang tribal mental and a system of legal view characterist of the territori organ of kazakh societi of the 18th 19th centuri is categor reject here the immens space occupi by kazakh on territori from the caspian to china requir some structur formal and particular center of attract thi coincid with the particular featur of histor develop of differ region and wa accompani subsequ by a system of administr divis conscious introduc by tsarism on the other hand the singular of manag of the economi also requir a precis regul of territori issu region affili therefor ha primordi plai an appreci role in the polit arrang but do we need to bring all thi into the 21st centuri after all under modern condit the rate of develop of the social and cultur system of the kazakh peopl ar absolut incommensur with that period thu despit the aspir understand to some extent to find in our own histori effect polit mechan we need to be realist and to recogn that the polit idea and polit symbol of past ag ar not suitabl for the end of the present centuri even in the past incident our great educ call for the prevent of a stratif of kazakh societi also popular in social circl ar liber idea at the end of the 1980 s and at the start of the present decad the gener euphoria at their triumph and the affirm of ideal common to all mankind and the right and liberti of man as the highest valu led to the optimist conclus as to the conclus victori of democraci and democrat principl but there ha come to be a gradual understand throughout the world that complex process also ar occur against the background of liber ideolog not to touch on other region of the world but to speak about our former common space mention ha to be made of the grow social tension in societi which is express at time in the most extrem form arm conflict polit confront econom anarchi and peopl s unbelief in the possibl of chang anyth instead of the growth of a civil market specul capit in all sphere financ trade foreign econom relat walk side by side with two companion crimin element and the corrupt nomenklatura these process have noth in common with the modern world market but thei exist in realiti manifestli contradict the veri essenc of liber ideolog intern conflict on the other hand graphic demonstr that argument about democraci and valu common to all mankind ar not as yet capabl of protect human life and digniti of cours the contradict between liber ideolog and harsh realiti mai be explain by refer to the legaci of totalitarian thi would be correct but onli partli so there ar more profound reason liber ideal and liber ideolog ar the result of the extens centuri long evolut of western civil the basi of these is compos of object prerequisit privat properti the mental of individu and democrat polit institut it rudiment with us were either absent or were interrupt almost a centuri ago in addit a strong legal system facilit the realiz of liber idea wa creat in civil state outsid of these object prerequisit thi process is extraordinarili more difficult the fact that the main and most popul support of the ideolog of liber the middl class as it is customarili call in social scienc doe not exist in the republ as yet ha to be seen also account should be taken of the actual cultur and histor situat as well the point be that with a mechan transfer of western liber ideolog to kazakhstan it propon would come up against such a phenomenon as cultur in the broad includ polit sens it natur and ideal cannot be chang in an instant the type of polit cultur need to be transform gradual in civil fashion and on the basi of real reform thu an analysi of the polit and ideolog direct in present dai kazakhstan testifi to the need for the search for particular path in the format of the ideolog platform we do not reject that which is valuabl that ha accumul within it socialist and tradit and liber view but the task confront kazakhstan requir in our view the conceptu of somewhat differ nation ideolog prioriti toward real independ we speak about the transit period what is it substanc to what do we aspir there ar a whole number of specif econom and polit direct which ar set forth in the constitut document of the execut and the legislatur and the program of certain parti of kazakhstan but asid from the specif task there is also a global purpos without have achiev which we cannot successfulli move forward along the path of the reform of societi it is a question of the achiev of the real independ of the republ despit it numer attribut and the recognit and assert of sovereignti to sai that kazakhstan ha acquir full independ would be prematur we must in the next few year concentr all effort on thi process we have for thi to resolv gener speak the follow kei problem to strengthen state principl build a state base on the rule of law and ensur the format of a full fledg nation market on a new product engin structur and institut basi such a formul of the issu will most like meet with the understand of parti and public movement the work forc entrepreneuri circl research and artist organ and repres of all strata of the popul of the republ inasmuch as the said prioriti ar of an all state natur and their realiz could effect the profound modern of kazakhstani societi if we seek so necessari a consensu we should also agre with such an inevit condit the achiev of real independ requir strong polit intellectu and spiritu support it is essenti that we secur not onli an econom organiz and personnel breakthrough in these direct but also creat an atmospher consolid societi and we have to have here an ideolog comprehens of our realiti gear both to the immedi and the more distant futur on of the main polit aspect for us in the impend work is the strengthen of statehood on the whole thi is a natur infer from the experi of world civil an object need for an increas in the regulatori influenc of the state which is essenti primarili to secur the emerg from the crisi and stabil of the socioeconom and social and polit situat is necessarili manifest in an era of profound crise and upheav we should concentr the main effort here on enhanc the role and respons of the execut strengthen the vertic line of manag and form strong presidenti rule both parliament and societi as a whole agre on the need for an intensif of thi process to which the quit precis alloc of function of the three branch of power in the countri s basic law testifi but the format of the state of kazakhstan is not confin mere to adopt of the constitut especi sinc it wa stipul from the veri outset that it is a constitut of a transit period which ha been creat it reflect the realiti of our present dai and the complex and contradict of our societi it provis and requir ar bind on all but it is necessari to ponder the prospect look into the futur even now the present suprem council is fulfil it histor mission and perform a great deal of work lai the foundat of the countri s legisl base the next stage of societ develop will inevit requir us to creat a profession parliament with clearli defin duti and power it is import also that we reach a common opinion on which of the world s preval and approv elector system is the optimum and which of them is applic for our republ the next task is the legisl separ of the power of the central state and local author in term of which the execut and repres author local ar suffici plenipotentiari in the solut of their problem the central structur would then be reliev of divers current busi and could concentr on the strateg direct of polit econom and social develop it is essenti to reform the judici system also unfortun peopl still have no faith in the author and compet of the judici author local it is as yet too earli to speak of the object of the court and the construct natur of their activ thei ar divorc from the problem of societi as it were it is necessari to make the judici system as effici as possibl and to rid it of the possibl which still exist of pressur be exert on the part of the power structur in the local particularli a most practic path of thi reform is the legisl enshrin of the appoint of judg by the head of state follow a recommend of a special suprem judici council sai we could thi wai ensur the genuin independ of the judg and cut short ani encroach on justic as we can see the process of the format of kazakhstani statehood is a complex labori and divers task and there should be no ill consid hast or unwarr slow here it is import to secur the mutual understand and interact of all branch of power we would be do futur gener a bad turn were we to loosen the foundat of the state for the sake of momentari polit benefit the accomplish of radic socioeconom reform undoubtedli belong among the main nation prioriti thi is a kei question of modern kazakhstan and it acquisit of independ the fate of the reform is directli link with the mechan of state control of the polit sphere inasmuch as kazakhstan s develop of recent decad ha been character by veri complex and larg scale process it is in thi period that a number of global program have been realiz on the territori of the republ these includ the develop of the virgin and fallow land the creation of industri s coloss raw materi base and nuclear and space research but the nation social and cultur problem introduc into kazakhstan by the realiz of these program went unstudi and uncomprehend behind the econom and militari aspect of these process a qualit chang occur for the first time the proport of the urban popul exceed that of the rural popul the uneven of the develop of the region increas sharpli there wa a chang in the nation composit of the popul on account of the huge immigr from the european part of the countri a sizabl group of an urban kazakh popul with the concentr of the bulk of the nation in the countrysid appear all of thi could not have fail to have led to the appear of veri strong differ in polit and cultur orient at the same time on the other hand the ostens ideolog uniti wa deliber emphas and exagger and the differ and problem were ignor as a result the ideolog and polit contradict of differ strata of the popul grew todai thei ar come to be manifest activ it is for thi reason that the mold of a new econom philosophi now occupi a special place thi is connect primarili with it direct influenc on an acceler of the progress of the reform the ideolog of a democrat rule of law societi base on a plural of idea is noth other than a reflect of view on the form of ownership and manag we have set as the strateg goal the format of genuin market mechan and a social orient multistructur market economi that is we have opt for the path of the creation of a societi in which econom liberti and the econom interest of the individu ar indisput and where the free express of belief and spiritu valu is guarante by the state and the law but ow to the tenac of past ideolog stereotyp the affirm of these norm can hardli be painless it is no secret that instanc of the open reject of the reform at both the power and the everydai level ar far from isol with us what is to be done in thi situat opt for a hard line polici establish the direct diktat of the state organ the persecut of the opposit for critic of the govern there have been mani exampl of thi in the contemporari histori of the

of late although it should be view not from the standpoint of the exclus of the offici languag and it counterpois to other as peopl have attempt to do but on the contrari from it unifi role the kazakh languag as a part of the cultur should be an addit factor of the consolid of all kazakhstani it is the basi of cognit for all nation and nation of the cultur tradit custom and everydai life of the

of the kazakh popul a rel great desir and readi to familiar itself with it nation root consequ we should not be exacerb the situat but creat the condit for fill in the gap moral sensit on the part of those for whom nation cultur and languag ar natur and organ is need also speak of the languag problem it is essenti to link it with our gener goal kazakhstan aspir to join the world commun on a par

knowledg of on s own and the offici languag ar a command of the time the state is requir to creat the necessari condit for studi in thi case also ani construct not destruct ideolog in kazakhstan should also take account of the fact that our state is not onli multin but also multicred a religi percept of the world is characterist of hundr of thousand of citizen and the number of follow of

common to all mankind ar the basi of the moral principl of variou religion the religi commun ar do a great deal to maintain in societi a healthi atmospher peac and harmoni and to establish spiritu it is import that the follow of variou creed can recogn their involv in the creation of the new statehood and have a vital interest in it strengthen and develop the renunci of the ideolog confront with religion and the adopt of the constitut and the law on freedom of religi belief and religi associ afford extens opportun in thi respect at the same time it is essenti to convei to the conscious of all that the secular natur of the state permit the most democrat solut of the question of free choic of ani religion or atheism and assur the equal of the creed also import is an understand that the separ

strive for fulfil of the provis of the constitut concern the impermiss of the creation of polit parti on a religi basi and the polit activ of religi associ we need to counteract attempt to us religi feel for instig conflict in societi and to promot the posit direct in the activ of the religion the effect of the new ideolog proposit on the other hand will also depend on how extens and successfulli

government apparatu and elsewher the govern is determin to remov these concret program will be introduc to ration and reduc all that cannot be accept in the sphere of public expenditur with our current low nation incom the same is envisag for public enterpris their role is to ensur on an econom sound basi the work of the economi and the life of the citizen and not to conceal the multitud of irration and weak behind their frequent monopolist behavior a polici of balanc the budget must be implement in order to increas public incom i believ that everi tax measur of the govern will come under a critic gaze and the govern will treat such critic respons howev the govern will stand firm when it come to everyon have to pai tax provid of cours that tax ar in line with the econom abil of the taxpay on the other hand citizen have to know where their monei is go and how even the last dinar is spent the govern will abid by the propos and program suggest that tax rate should not be increas but rather that the tax base and the number of taxpay be extend in implement the polici of balanc the budget the govern is determin to establish the strictest of budgetari disciplin and will cooper close with the feder govern and the montenegrin govern that is why we call on you deputi in thi assembl and the public in gener to extend your full support to thi polici the polici of healthi currenc will repres the main impetu to all the econom activ and the realist increas of the social product in stabl condit without much involv or sponsorship by the state and it bodi room will be made for free entrepreneur and econom initi the place where realist econom calcul is possibl ar place where solid product and success trade will also be possibl in other word the aim of the govern is to creat an atmospher in which the market motiv for product will strengthen i beg you for your attent you will have a chanc colleagu deputi to particip as much as you like later on instead of have illus about product and new invest base on the currenc issu a market system will be creat in which everyon will be motiv and econom forc to produc and sell as much as he can the bitter experi of the last few year have taught us that motiv product from the primari issu inflict the most damag on that veri product anoth chanc should not be given to those who still do not believ thi such lesson have alreadi cost too much for that reason all compani will have to establish themselv on the ground of realist econom criteria none of them should expect ani more state subsidi from the budget or the currenc issu thei should themselv becom an import sourc of budgetari incom and new invest i suggest to compani that expect thi rather than through their own product that thei will find a solut in state subsidi and word indistinct directli or through the trade union that thei should immedi chang their manag sinc the govern will not accept ani financ without back or ani other form of deviat from the program a healthi economi even if it is temporarili poor still ha great possibl to exploit the resourc avail and becom rich while an unhealthi economi that is financ without back can never becom that that is why there is no altern to the polici of a healthi and stabl currenc and that is why the govern will not give up on thi polici at ani cost the govern s agricultur polici will also be in line with the spirit of the fundament commit in the program thi mean that the agricultur and the food industri will be place in the same condit of product as other field there will be full equal of all properti relat and stimul measur will be introduc that will motiv the merg of agricultur properti and the develop of farm by give full freedom to the develop of co oper by secur protect price for the basic agricultur product and by introduc other form of develop motiv here too there can be no return to financ without back agricultur product will be support onli from realist resourc and with firm guarante with the aim of stimul product better suppli and strengthen the posit of the new dinar the most import issu now is the increas of traffic both by access reserv and by exchang compani foreign currenc for new dinar the govern shall insist that the process of exchang compani and bank foreign currenc is expedit without ani administr restrict in order to make it possibl for product and trade to on the basi of their financi potenti acquir fresh fund necessari for carri out busi function sentenc as heard those compani that alreadi have good program should be given immedi support thei should immedi begin realiz these program includ product for export howev the impress is that some of the bank have still not adapt to these condit the measur of the monetari polici should establish condit for bank to respect the need for reason real interest rate and as soon as possibl that is on of the kei prerequisit for increas product on market principl the settlement of debt and the reinstat of trust in bank and other financi institut is to a signific degre link to solv the problem of old foreign currenc save serbia will not allow a singl on of it foreign currenc saver to be depriv of hi or her foreign currenc invest or it valu in dinar concret solut for thi problem will be propos in a rel short while the move of social polici outsid the domain of the compani and base on thi the strengthen of their competit edg is a veri import aim of the entir program it is known that a great number of temporarili unemploi worker object ar not particip in the product process and that thi ha been so for some time thei ar now essenti receiv welfar from their compani the state and not the compani must secur welfar and secur for the citizen and the unemploi the state must primarili help the worker who have been laid off by help them to chang their profess and through altern employ moreov pai out the incom of unemploi worker in the form of welfar taken from the state budget rather than the compani would repres a more ration solut if noth els becaus it would elimin the cost that aris from keep in busi unprofit compani and fictiti employ howev we ar not focus on lai off

devot itself to the task that the execut author have in a legal state the serbian govern will make everi effort in accord with the law and the constitut to carri out the respons it ha taken on at thi difficult moment to implement the program of monetari reconstruct and the econom recoveri of our countri togeth with the feder govern and the montenegrin govern the program which ha been built on the basi of a market economi ha drawn a line between the compet treat all sector of economi equal the success of the reform demand from everyon to respond to the duti in their line of work thi mean that the economi will have to turn to the product and to reli fulli on it own initi and entrepreneurship the social servic will have to show a greater degre of respons and effici the state administr will have to work more expertli and react more quickli in elimin the obstacl in the consist implement of the program and a higher degre of readi in fight crime of all kind and in elimin war profit the citizen ar given a particularli import role without their full confid their accept of the program and their understand for the inevit teeth difficulti without their respons to their tax and other duti the implement of the program would undoubtedli encount further difficulti becaus of the seriou chang it bring with it the program ha in my opinion histor import it ha such import particularli as a mean for the defens of the sovereignti of the countri it ha taken great courag for us to commit ourselv to a convert dinar at time of an econom blockad and succe in defend it for it part the serbian govern stress it firm resolut in persev in the consist implement of the program of monetari reform and econom recoveri the govern is awar that the organ of the government bodi ha to be improv and thei have to be made respons for carri out task in line with that the govern will undertak a seri of oper measur and will organ a system to observ the implement of the program in order to react promptli to transgress as thei occur i am convinc that we ar all awar of the difficulti connect with thi task and of the signific of the period befor us none of us ha ani illus that differ view and attitud can be avoid in a democrat assembl between polit parti and in accord with that that thi program and the polici base on it will easili get the necessari support here i have to stress howev that econom life itself ha almost impos such a program as an altern to the chao of hyperinfl and complet collaps with unpredict econom social and polit consequ that is why i call on all the parti and the deputi on the behalf of the govern to cooper on thi program whose main orient must not be question at ani time the seriou effort that the govern ha to put in in the next few month and year to achiev econom revit ar inde necessari in order to allevi the effect of the sanction these effort will continu to be necessari even after the sanction ar lift in order to avoid econom and polit chao to protect domest product from unprincipl rivalri from outsid and to provid all those market product and financi rule that ar necessari for an economi to becom more success howev these great and imper effort concern the economi that the govern must undertak should also be accompani by similarli great and imper effort in other sphere of social life health educ scienc cultur and inform the intern blockad undermin not onli the econom life in serbia but the social life as well and for thi reason relat effort ar need the intern blockad definit brought about a stagnat in the develop of scienc the provici of cultur educ that is excess turn exclus toward the nation and the past and subject and defeat in the dissemin of inform these ar the occurr that more or less cannot be avoid under the condit of a major intern

at everi level from school to univers to link ourselv to the greatest achiev and best experi in the develop world the aim of thi linkag would be to prepar the young gener for profession and intellectu

more danger than econom isolation it consequ ar reflect in the idea of the youngest gener and last long after the idea and practic of isolation have pass through educ the young gener must be made

is import to emphas that recent the drop in product which in some measur wa previous structur in charact is acquir the attribut of univers degrad strike the most progress and highli technolog sector

in the categori of the non competit and especi of the unnecessari thu given an overal drop in product in 1993 of 16 percent the output of miner fertil fell by 22 percent protein feed by 33 percent roll sheet by 21 percent diesel locomot by 33 percent tractor by 35 percent fabric by 27 percent and shoe by 34 percent it is imposs not to take note also of the uncontrol develop redistribut of industri output in the direct of the raw materi sector the debat concern the degre of the interfer of the state in the econom life of societi and first of all in the sphere of monei credit and financi relat ha becom the core of discuss concern the subsequ path of the reform thi disput is not origin the fact is that the role of the state in regul the economi wa discuss over the centuri with us thi problem ha boil down to rather primit question is there a gosplan state plan committe in japan or isn t there will the govern allot monei for the agro industri complex or quit the opposit so low a level of discuss indic at least two thing first the unwilling of the market to debat about rather incontrovert and obviou thing and precis about the fact that the state in western countri in actual fact activ and at time even aggres interfer in all sphere of the economi and secondli the inadequ theoret level of their oppon the statist who don t know appar that there wa such a scholar as j m keyn who ha creat a doctrin under the name of keynesian the basic idea of which is precis the interfer of the state in the economi let us note howev that to argu about who is right keyn or friedman and whose recommend to adher to dure the convers to the market mean to run to the same extrem by which the discipl of the plan and of the market sin at the end of the 1980 s or let s sai to assert that it s better to break an egg from the blunt end and not from the sharp end on sided is also quit fatal under our condit of market convers on can encount the idea that it is enough to liber price and to not interfer in the economi and all will be in order the hostag of which we ar alreadi for the third year perhap onli in textbook as an illustr of how on must not do the kei thought of the adher of the chicago school is to overcom inflat at ani price in the process the sequest of budget expenditur and the reduct of the monei suppli emerg as the main weapon of thi struggl howev it is gener known that inflat is a categori not onli of the sphere of monetari circul but also of product in essenc inflat is a multi factor process which affect both monetari circul and product thi is an axiom that is why to restrict emiss while not pai attent to the catastroph state of affair in industri is a fatal polici of cours it is possibl to not pai debt to the budgetari sphere for the sake of lower the inflat level but what happen with debtor is well known a bitter hangov after the banquet of the deflationist of 1992 1993 await the economi in the spring and summer it would be a danger delus to assert that a given model approv in other countri is suit for russia ye of cours there ar econom law which oper in ani countri but the conclus that freidman s doctrin is etern becaus it is true should not at all follow from thi russia need it own path which under present condit can be formul as stop and go simpli put to balanc on a tightrop to pass between the scylla of hyperinfl and the charybdi of mass unemploy and social shock let s examin for exampl the extraordinarili complex situat develop in the agrarian sector of the economi agrarian reform is a measur which ha long sinc come to a head which is direct to the creation of a mix agricultur system and it adapt to market relationship at the same time while the overal trend of the reform is posit the agrarian sector is present in profound crisi the reform began here spontan to a certain degre which ha had an effect on the charact of it develop despit the great number of decis adopt up to now we don t have an integr program for the develop of the agrarian sector even for the next few year meanwhil the situat with the suppli of the popul with foodstuff even earlier prior to 1990 repres the most import problem of achiev econom secur and alwai wa a caus give rise to social tension the popul s tobacco and milk riot of 1990 and 1991 which took place even with a higher satur of the food market than now ar memor the transit to a market system of food distribut when it shortag is manifest not in empti store counter but in the weekli increas in the price of top prioriti food product at first glanc somewhat lessen the acut of the problem howev such a situat cannot last for long the social tension in thi sphere remain hidden so far and doe not spill out into the street howev with a continu tendenc toward an increas in the price for basic foodstuff and a simultan reduct of real monei incom ever broader strata of the popul can slide into a situat that is beyond the limit for them and thi is fraught with the manifest of veri seriou social consequ the drop in invest activ is no less profound and danger regard it social and polit consequ dure the last two year alon the volum of invest in the russian economi ha shrunk more than two time and todai come to about 40 percent of the pre crisi level with such invest there can be no talk not onli of expand but also of simpl reproduct not onli progress structur reorgan but even simpl mainten of product volum at a fix level is imposs the special critic of the situat in the invest sphere is relat to the fact that the depreci of fix product capit is approach 60 percent i e the threshold beyond which the destruct of the countri s product potenti begin the basic factor which have been respons for the invest crisi have been primarili high inflat and the drop in product

about 60 percent of all capit invest ar account for by the meager intern fund of the enterpris some 15 percent of the financ from the republ budget and 16 percent from local budget came from central

the effect of foreign trade relationship is undergo substanti deform which alreadi at the present time is result in the transform of relat in foreign trade the correl of extern and intern price will

1994 we dug about 4 000 km of aqueduct by the year 2000 we will have dug anoth 2 000 km these 4 000 km ar more than we have dug in the past 30 40 50 60 year the implement of thi program requir dig canal and aqueduct longer than the nile river and build on fourth as mani barrag as were built in egypt sinc the time of muhammad ali i onc visit a big countri where thei show me a bridg thei told me it is the longest bridg over a river in the world thei said it is 2 100 meter long i told them we have a 2 300 meter long bridg audienc laugh we actual have such a bridg in the north near disuq thei boast thei have a 2 000 meter long bridg i told them we have 2 200 and 2 300 meter long bridg we have mani bridg over the nile we have mani bridg and barrag on the nile but the peopl forget televis must enlighten the peopl on what is happen in their countri so that thei can be proud of their countri i am proud of my countri becaus i know what is be done everi citizen must know these thing so that he will be proud of hi countri these great effort have increas crop product which ha brought the product of egyptian soil near intern standard the product of sugar cane and rice ha increas in recent year the increas in product of these crop is the primari aim of the agricultur polici these crop ar the main food sourc and constitut a consider part of the product requir for sever of our factori we have increas hope that our agricultur export will increas brother i hear mani voic sai we can cultiv the desert and eat wheat but where would we get the water from thei sai we can achiev self suffici in wheat from the land cultiv at present at the expens of rice cotton etc i onc read in a newspap about some offici in on of the council ask why do we import fish when we have the mediterranean sea and the red sea our coast do not have fish why then do our fishermen from damietta and port said go to eritrea and yemen to fish we would not have to import fish if our sea were full of fish in the past we had a fleet that sail to morocco to fish but it oper at a loss i do not know where thei sold the fish audienc laugh we should realli understand ye we have a sea but we also have an econom market thi mean you don t bring in larg ship to fish when thei can t catch ani otherwis you will have to pai the fishermen s wage the ship will lose monei we will have to subsid them with tax monei and thei will onli bring you 200 or 300 kg of fish which if you can sell it will not cover even a small part of the expenditur we must understand well that we can never satisfi the demand by god we ar increas in number doe thi mean that we have to cultiv the desert everi time our popul increas where will i get water for thi all our water is enough for onli 2 or 2 5 million feddan at most and my god our popul increas by between 12 and 13 million everi year increas in egypt s crop product show how we can quickli reach the level of world product and even surpass them if the effort of farmer worker and the busi sector come togeth we ar proud of the farmer and the great work thei ar do for thi homeland thei must take better care of their crop and take into account the recommend of agricultur expert especi in the wake of the liber of crop price the scientist in egypt s univers institut and research center must work in the field in order to appli the achiev of the agricultur revolut which ha permit food self suffici in mani countri the busi sector whose role in and contribut to the nation economi is increas must invest more in the modern technolog and servic requir to rais the egyptian soil s product the great success in the field of agricultur expans and the obviou progress in the product cycl confirm the possibl of achiev similar success in diversifi our agricultur export which should be the second main object of our agricultur polici i have issu instruct that we should begin plan right now under the direct supervis of an apparatu that is free of red tape and bureaucraci to seek wai of exploit the new land in sinai so that thei reach half a million feddan after complet of the peac canal project the comprehens develop of the egyptian countrysid is the third object of our agricultur polici and thi mean focus on econom activ that ar connect to agricultur it is not reason or accept to let develop in egypt s countrysid be depend on the product of agricultur crop alon with half of egypt s manpow be emploi in thi sector in fact we have start experi in a number of villag in some governor and we will appli the result of these experi or amend them in the light of accumul experi so that develop will encompass the whole egyptian countrysid brother and sister our hope becom increasingli clear and bright when we review togeth the outcom of the huge effort undertaken in the field of industri you ar the hero and the vanguard of thi effort thi effort ha proceed in two parallel and complementari direct the first cours is the renov and modern of exist industri plant that ar suffer from wear and tear the second cours is the establish of new industri zone and equip with all need util and servic so that thei will be readi to receiv the biggest number of factori we have invest 34 billion pound in industri and mine over the past 11 year now we speak in term of billion wherea befor we spoke in term of million in the past the biggest power station cost 100 million pound now a power station such as shubra al khaymah cost 1 2 billion pound a million ha becom like a shill audienc laugh thei invent new name for a million instead of a rabbit and word indistinct audienc laugh we have invest 42 billion pound we have built new industri zone equip with servic and util so far we have built 13 industri new town and five new commun and we spent 3 3 billion pound on provid them with util by thi invest we have been abl to attract 3 044 project and factori in the town of 10 ramadan 6 octob al sadat citi burj al arab and other area the egyptian privat sector ha invest over 10 billion pound in these town provid job opportun for 170 000 egyptian when investor start a project and we give them tax break some peopl sai reduc their exempt our brother in the peopl s assembl sometim sai there is no need to provid tax exempt 10 year is too much i provid exempt to an investor to encourag him to emploi worker as far as i am concern it is better for him to emploi worker than to pai tax he will build hous what i will do with the tax monei i want more hous if he give us more i will treat him well he provid livelihood for the peopl and thi bring happi to the citizen thi is what we need emphasi on industri ha produc good result industri now constitut 42 percent of total nation invest it contribut to 28 percent of the local product and absorb 20 percent of the egyptian manpow expect to be emploi dure the year of the third five year plan thi success ha encourag us to establish new zone which ar be implement within the framework of the third five year plan all necessari fund have been earmark for establish 12 new town and industri zone if these town ar not establish and the hous and factori not built where will we be we will be in a mess the peopl will have no hous no job no livelihood all of us must calmli rememb what we have done where were we and where ar we now in the first year we gave prioriti to the more needi governor abov all the upper egypt governor we had faith in the need to intensifi effort in these area after we felt the increas desir of the citizen to invest in the first area alloc for thi purpos name the industri zone in suhaj to which 73 investor have appli in the past three month it is a new zone in suhaj we ar creat new area in upper egypt so our brother will invest there some peopl from upper egypt want to invest in cairo why don t you invest there no thei want to invest here near cairo peopl want to escap from thi cairo audienc laugh it is crowd we will find an agricultur project in aswan for them so 73 investor book plot of land in suhaj and began the measur to build their factori brother and sister our goal in the next few year is to make egypt a leader among nation receiv industri invest in the middl east the whole world is look for investor and i hope we will not drive them awai some peopl sai someon is drive a so and so car so what as long as he ha got a legitim busi you know how much duti he pai on hi car when he goe to clear hi car from custom financ minist al razzaz doe not spare him audienc laugh he ha to pai where doe the monei go thi make up our revenu i know that some peopl try to find a wai out some peopl try to bring in car on a trip ticket previou two word in english but we know how to deal with them peopl have told me about thi i also heard someth els which is veri strang and i told the financ minist about it a short while ago someon import equip the duti on which is 12 000 pound for instanc he leav the item in custom and tell them he doe not want it after a while it will have to be sold at auction in the meantim he make an arrang with some peopl to bui it at the auction if the duti on an item is 12 000 for instanc thei bui it for 2 000 then the origin buyer give these peopl anoth 2 000 for profit and bui the item for 4 000 which doe not cover the custom duti so you have to watch out for such trick audienc laugh someon told me about thi last night howev trick ar everywher i wa abroad and everywher i went i heard of similar trick all law can be circumv we ar human after all our goal in the next few year is to make egypt a leader among nation receiv industri invest in the middl east and to be a major center of export to all world market thi mean we must doubl our determin and effort in sever direct first to continu our drive to remov all obstacl face exist and new invest i have heard much from investor and i believ the govern is work on measur in the field of product necess and other relat to the gatt so that we can be competit we must develop our legisl and condit to cope with the world trend so that we could find new market in our trip abroad we try to find market everywher i go i try to find market henc the initi i announc at the peopl s assembl in novemb when i call for abolish all administr procedur for project with a capit that doe not exce five million pound so that all investor had to do wa to inform the compet author about their project the egyptian respons to thi step ha been excel dure the past four month alon 190 investor have appli for project to the tune of 410 million pound that will creat 13 000 job natur the peopl do not want to go through lengthi procedur whether in the electr sector invest author or whatev i try to attend meet of the invest committe to see what is happen in on such meet that i attend i found a project submit by two youngster for approxim 260 000 pound thei had been wait for eight month why so the idea cross my mind i said why don t we remov obstacl face investor with capit up to five million pound all thei need to do is find a plot of land in the new citi or in the desert not on agricultur land and then inform the author let them start and notifi the invest author which cannot veto them the invest author s job is to process the paper for them so that thei can qualifi for the exempt now that thi initi ha succeed i call on the govern to rais the ceil to 10 million pound applaus the same procedur will appli if you have a project to the tune of 10 million pound inform the invest author and start your project there ar mani place in upper egypt we have to make a breakthrough if we do not run we will be lost the peopl abroad ar run veri fast to see where their interest ar if we sit still and do noth it will not work second to complet as quickli as possibl establish and equip a third group of industri zone i believ that the govern ha taken measur to establish these zone in the area north of the gulf of suez port said damietta and west of alexandria on my visit to foreign countri i discuss thi issu with interest countri we have great hope but thi will take time we have been work on thi field sinc reconstruct minist al kafrawi ha held thi post he know the area north of the gulf of suez the problem is that we cooper with countri that ar beset by bureaucraci much more than we ar we ar establish industri zone in the area north of the gulf of suez port said damietta and west of alexandria we will also establish industri zone in upper egypt anyon can invest in the industri zone in kafr al shaykh or ani other area these industri zone ar not confin to al minufiyah al gharbiyah or ani other area anyon can establish project anywher and live in these area third we will initi a larg intern effort to make these area perman site for complet industri and stockpil product and distribut for intern trade i think i broach thi issu dure my visit to the prc we will try to benefit from world experi in establish modern center for market and train servic and introduc technolog into small project in egyptian citi and the countrysid our hope for a better futur do not stem from a void but from an object assess of the huge achiev that provid egypt with enorm product center that ar prepar to accommod thousand of new project i do not need to repeat the effort we have exert and the resourc we have alloc to rebuild the infrastructur which had deterior under increas burden i will not repeat the requir for new expans our goal of rebuild the basic util wa not confin to provid for the enorm hous need we focus as much attent on strengthen the industri sector capabl and provid it with electr transport and a sewag system i rememb that in 1983 or perhap late in 1982 i visit a factori i ask the manag what thei made he said the factori produc refriger and wash machin i notic that the worker were sit do noth i ask why and if the factori wa not oper thei told me that the power wa out and that the factori had electr power for onli two hour a dai i thought if it wa reason for a factori that had the capabl of produc 100 refriger a dai to have electr for onli two hour and produc onli 10 or 15 refriger i thought the worker would be psycholog frustrat becaus the more thei produc the more thei could get the factori wa lose and the worker were not to blame egypt at the time produc onli 18 billion kilowatt which wa insuffici now thank god egypt produc over 70 billion kilowatt had it not been for thi increas energi product we would not have had the new town industri progress or hous etc we focus thi much attent on bolster the industri sector capabl and provid the requir of electr energi transport transport and sewag network so that egyptian or foreign investor can establish plant or project that provid job to thousand of peopl who enter the work market everi dai in thi respect i think it is imper that i mention two problem that have exhaust the egyptian mind in the past decad in search of sound solut the first is the problem of popul growth which exce econom and social develop rate thi mai prove to be too difficult for our capabl to handl in the near futur if we do not watch out for the popul growth a time will come when we will be like some countri that cannot feed their peopl if the increas continu where will we get the subsidi from it will have to come through more tax we will not be abl to build road we will not be abl to creat job no matter what we do in the near futur if we do not take thi into consider and thi take year to pai off egypt will face danger mayb not in our lifetim but dure futur gener which we work for the issu of popul growth is veri seriou we will not be abl to find job place and a proper life for them we will be like some countri which i do not want to name where peopl live in the mountain with question food suppli someon from on countri told me that thei have approxim 100 million peopl live below the poverti line thei do not even give them bread or anyth thei leav them on their own to eat grass and i do not mean the other grass egyptian arab word for grass is hashish audienc laugh or anyth els natur thi also result in the problem of unemploy the second problem is unemploy which ha been on the rise in recent year although it root and caus go back to earlier administr dure which real product wa not the object of employ as far as the popul growth is concern the effort to which the entir peopl have contribut have made notic progress which all sign indic will be sustain for long year to come the increas in popul cannot be stop over night it take year for the rate to go down the growth in popul ha gone down to approxim 2 2 which point to a sensibl respons by egyptian famili to the call for plan our prophet ha said a strong believ is better and closer to god than a weak believ if i have a modest incom and a famili of 10 how can i feed them just have them around the hous will rais your blood pressur and you will die audienc laugh each on will ask for someth but if the famili is small no matter what headach thei mai caus you can handl it you will be abl to offer them a proper life educ them dress them well and give them medic treatment thi is becaus we do not know what the futur ha in stock for us i believ the futur gener will not go through the labyrinth we our father and grandfath had to go through the world ha shown an interest in the drop in the popul growth in egypt cairo ha been chosen to host on of the most import confer on popul in the 20th centuri under the auspic of the unit nation thousand of polit leader scientist and thinker will meet in egypt to exchang idea on popul issu the chines for instanc increas by 15 million everi year i laugh with them and told them why don t you take 30 million more from us and pretend that you increas by 30 million extra in two year audienc laugh we welcom thi confer and the arriv of the elit world leader thinker and expert but in the midst of thi success we must not forget that despit the drop in popul growth in the past few year the rate of popul growth in egypt is still higher than in mani countri that strive to improv the live standard of their peopl despit thi drop we expect from now until the year 2000 to increas by 12 million peopl of them more than 3 5 million youngster will join the labor market mai god help us find job for them we will have to find fruit job for them not to mention those who ar left behind without a job as a result of the popul increas in the past 10 year all thi caus us to intensifi govern and popular effort to sustain the success made in control the popul increas whether in hamlet villag or citi as for the problem of unemploy it exist all over the world and i am not defend it the unit state is run around try to open door for worker in franc which also suffer from a high unemploy rate the french foreign minist ha told the peopl don t expect me to solv thi problem quickli becaus it take year here some peopl think it can be solv overnight someon come out and call for unemploy benefit how can we tell who is work and who is unemploi mayb someon is work in the privat sector and is appli for work in the govern abroad thei have comput and know all the inform if someon submit an applic thei will check hi name on the comput is our system here computer no and to computer it we need monei mubarak is ask by someon in the audienc about law no 55 he repli no the govern is still work on it becaus it is a veri complic issu do you want to quit or what audienc laugh perhap the proper wai to address the problem of unemploy is that for the first time we have a detail chart that contain accur inform on the matter the comprehens survei conduct throughout all governor and villag show that the number of univers and school graduat who have appli for work in the past 10 year is 3 946 million peopl almost four million we have found job for approxim 2 5 million of them also 835 000 more job have been found for applic who do not hold univers or school degre thi show that despit the difficulti the egyptian economi ha manag to provid 3 4 million job in the past 10 year that is 341 000 number as heard job annual but we cannot go on like thi indefinit thei need industri land etc for how long can we keep up howev the popul increas ha forc on us a situat where a number of graduat remain unemploi thei number approxim 2 4 million and thei repres 9 2 of the egyptian work forc the unemploy rate is measur in comparison to the total work forc and thi is the wai it is everywher in the world i will read to you some figur about unemploy in the world and thei ar statist obtain from world magazin in other word we did not make them up to suit our purpos in spain the rate is 23 percent in franc it is 12 percent and these ar major industri nation in itali it is 11 7 percent in the uk it is approxim 10 percent in germani it is 9 1 percent in the netherland it is 4 2 percent in belgium it is 11 percent in denmark it is 11 percent in finland it is 12 5 percent and in ireland it is 20 percent thi is just to show you the rate around the world the rate in egypt is 9 2 percent of the work forc you ar not unawar of the strenuou effort undertaken by the state to cope with thi steadi increas in the number of citizen who join the work forc annual i repeat onc again that the effect wai to address thi situat is to increas the growth rate in gross domest product to be more than doubl the rate of popul growth thi alon can absorb the new work forc while at the same time lessen the number of the exist unemploi we will not manag to expand product unless we ar abl to sell our product in the world market thi is an import point if product increas but it cannot be sold nobodi will increas the product it will be wast thu we must find world market the world market have their own condit and i believ that the privat sector is more activ than the busi sector in thi regard and i hope the latter will catch up in the meantim the privat sector must be more activ and we ar help it we ar open door abroad and it ha to do the rest a businessman with a larg product onc came to me and ask that the govern market hi product abroad i told him that i would not pai him on fourth of the price of hi product audienc laugh how could the govern market hi product let it market it own product or not right atif sidqi audienc laugh we will not be abl to expand the product base until we ar abl to sell their product in world market thi make the expans of export a persist requir and a basic condit for progress in addit thi is consid an essenti requir for bridg the present gap in the balanc of payment and the trade balanc thi gap is caus by the fact that we import 11 billion worth of commod and our export exclud oil total approxim 1 5 billion we do not doubt that egypt s worker and produc will forg ahead to achiev thi strateg goal so as to fulfil the homeland s hope for egypt to take it fair share in intern trade the govern will support everi effort aim at promot export and will remov all administr obstacl befor export it remain for the produc and worker to make qualiti the focu of attent and activ let 1994 brother and sister be the year of qualiti and the good name of egyptian product a year in which we will all particip to achiev great stride in our export and to come close to a balanc between import and export achiev thi goal also requir us to go ahead with reform the mismanag compani now that we have drawn up a comprehens program that we hope to abl to implement in 1995 so that the worker of these compani will enjoi new circumst allow for increas product and higher wage the worker in ani success establish have a right to have higher wage that link wage and product the stanc of the worker establish on the reform program wa splendid and prove that egypt s worker ar the soldier of reform who have a real interest in promot the product establish and their capabl applaus brother and sister a seriou and frank confront of shortcom and the root of problem and a firm commit to the reform program will win egypt world respect and will give us increas confid in a brighter futur the concret indic of thi futur ar the fruit of reform that ar manifest to everyon we us to spend more than our annual incom and would pai the accumul and increas deficit by borrow insid and outsid egypt howev we have ration our expenditur develop our revenu sourc and have come veri close to strike a balanc between the state s revenu and expenditur certain circumst dictat that we impos new tax but we were care that most of the burden affect those who can afford to pai howev it wa inevit that part of thi burden would affect all segment of societi in order to curb inflat preserv the valu of the nation currenc and address the remain defect that hinder the nation economi i am not an economist but when inflat rise price will go up simpli speak when inflat beset a countri there will be more monei than product price will skyrocket to the point that no on can control the econom reform polici which econom expert and intern establish testifi ar be soundli implement have gener increas confid in our nation economi the budget deficit drop thi year to less than 3 percent but at on time it had risen to about 25 percent thi is the main problem in mani countri of the world inflat rate have drop to 8 percent and the save deposit have continu to increas free the exchang rate and lift restrict on foreign currenc have improv the invest atmospher and reassur export we have end the black market we also confront those us the peopl s livelihood to acquir huge profit by exploit the flow of subsidi we face the problem with courag we devot the entir subsidi to basic commod for the toil mass name bread sugar and edibl oil thi enabl us to guarante that thi subsidi would go to the right peopl howev there wa much fraud but i do not want to go into detail we elimin mani restrict that were impos on invest we reduc tax on product equip and tool but some peopl sai thi is not enough howev the issu still requir in depth studi and new measur becaus 42 percent of the nation industri machineri is be import from abroad thi is why the govern will look into the product prerequisit so that we can compet i must help the industri sector the privat sector and the busi sector to enabl them to compet in the world market the current competit is extrem keen the competit race will assum a new stage after the implement of gatt we lift the unjust burden that obstruct produc thi will help them reduc product cost and enhanc the abil of egyptian product to compet in local and foreign market thi will also help produc enter world market and maintain a distinguish posit for egyptian export brother and sister the sound start point in the social econom and even polit transform process dictat that we marshal our greatest energi to creat a radic chang in the educ philosophi commensur with develop need and societi s requir i believ that we ar pursu a sound path the egyptian citizen repres our most valuabl treasur the egyptian citizen is our hope and through thi citizen alon the process of progress is complet and egypt s aspir object ar achiev progress cannot be achiev without the promot of the egyptian citizen s energi and the transfer of the largest number of thi peopl into particip in increas and promot the qualiti of product thi is first among the mani huge task that we still have to perform the wai to attain thi task is to reconsid our concept of the educ and train institut which ar inde product establish that should be given prioriti in our invest program the develop world ha realiz that the potenti and talent of a product human be can be perceiv and nurtur from the first year of educ the school is now a center for receiv educ and the develop of skill prais be to god we realiz that the import of promot the qualiti of educ and it role in train and prepar skill will alwai enabl the citizen to have the appropri job opportun thi could never have been done without an overal nation program to modern our school and promot their syllabus we must focu on the substanc and qualiti and not on quantiti dure the school year to enabl our son to carri out school activ that would develop their skill the implement of thi program start last year when with the cooper and effect and worthi particip of friend the abl son of thi countri manag to insur the largest possibl degre of invest to build thousand of modern school that can serv thi new concept and the object of educ last year alon 1 500 school were built and 7 800 other were renov all thi cost us 1 3 billion pound thi is where monei is spent step ar under wai to build 1 500 school thi year at a time when the invest expenditur were doubl over the past two year the expenditur ar four time those incur in 1992 nevertheless there still ar mani thing to be achiev becaus the program to modern the egyptian school need ten of billion of pound it is worth note that the plan to develop and modern technic educ and vocat train adopt the two side educ system appli in mani advanc countri thi system is base on combin educ and train in the institut becaus train is the basic factor in creat skill labor peopl who can deal with complic technic problem and increas the qualiti of product our new industri facil in madinat al ashir min ramadan madinat sittah uktubar al sadat burj al arab and other area will pioneer thi new educ trend thi should get us off to a good start in the 21st centuri where factori blend with school laboratori with librari and product and industri with scienc and innov and where qualiti is base on research and creativ the second task face us is that of find a comprehens solut to the problem of egyptian citizen live in randomli built slum area the randomli built area ar scar on egypt s face the level of public servic avail in these area is much lower than anyth we consid accept for a dear section of the egyptian peopl as you mai know i have instruct the compet author to prepar a two part comprehens plan to face thi problem the first part alreadi under wai deal with the problem of exist randomli built area mani of which go back to the thirti in thi centuri when we look close into the randomli built area we discov that some go back to the year 1924 the first shantytown sprang up in 1924 by the sixti the phenomenon had mushroom and in the seventi and eighti it got even wors in al jizah there is a place call izbat al sa aydah that goe back to 1924 saqiyat makki date back to 1960 and al munib to 1970 in cairo izbat abu ard goe back to 1955 arab ghunaym and arab wadi to 1960 manshiyat nasir to 1962 and izbat al hajjanah to 1965 in alexandria izbat al sayd goe back to 1960 all these ar randomli built area that came into be over the year i would like to tell you thi when we began the first develop plan we were not abl to take care of everi problem in the countri we had to make prioriti the monei we had at our dispos wa limit we spend it accord to prioriti updat the infrastructur build hous and so on and so forth now it is time to address the problem of randomli built area do you know how much these randomli built area will cost us we have spent 581 million pound so far in order to rehabilit these area in 11 governor we will need seven billion pound shall we cut back all other program to focu on thi problem by the time we get to the other governor the sum total of expenditur on randomli built area will reach 17 billion we ar awar of the size of the problem and within our resourc will do everyth possibl to resolv it i want everi citizen to live in digniti in the first part of the aforesaid plan we will spend 600 million pound in urban renov program of which the southern governor will receiv about 300 million pound the second part of the plan aim at prevent the emerg of such area in the futur through the build of plan area in all governor on a scale suffici to absorb the increas in urban popul thi effort will fall within the third develop plan a third task face us is that of protect low incom household in order to achiev social justic the countri will continu to offer equal opportun in educ and to provid free educ in all state run school the state is also commit to provid health care to the needi in it hospit and clinic over the next few year we will redoubl our effort to improv the qualiti of health care provid in state run hospit and clinic the state also take it upon itself to subsid bread even if it cost goe up we ar now spend 1 542 billion on bread subsidi and will maintain these subsidi on principl even though we ar awar of the rise cost involv due to increas wheat price and the higher demand associ with the growth in popul the state is provid thi subsidi becaus it believ that the poor should be abl to bui bread at a price that suit their incom the state s guarante is confirm and is continu in all these field howev the real guarante for those who ar not abl to help themselv is achiev by help them becom abl to help themselv therefor as of next year we will alloc more financi resourc for the social fund for the product famili project and for the project of support craftsmen and owner of small workshop to help these group rais their incom the fourth mission is the comprehens and continu modern of the product of commod and servic thi is on of the most import challeng that we must meet as soon as possibl thi will enabl egyptian produc to dedic their effort to develop egyptian commod in form and substanc the fifth mission is the develop of the egyptian administr system so that it will be abl to effect the desir chang aim at increas the egyptian societi s capac for product and export we must search for qualifi peopl and select those capabl of turn loss into profit and failur into success in our establish we must train these personnel on the most modern method of administr thi must take place under the supervis and auspic of effici trainer capabl of effect thi chang in the egyptian administr system brother and sister we ar dedic all our effort and work for the sake of god and the homeland in all our step we adher to the basic interest of the peopl we make sacrific to make them happi and we work hard to make them secur an examin of our activ abroad will reveal to those who wish to know that the main aim of thi activ is to serv the domest front provid the proper climat for the promot of the nation interest secur the egyptian peopl s right to develop their resourc achiev the maximum employ of their creativ capabl and arriv at a better life thi wa our pledg and commit when we extend the bridg of friendship and understand to the variou peopl of the world in the east and west and in the north and south thi wa our wish and desir when we exploit these relat to find work opportun for egyptian worker abroad and to open new market for egyptian commod and servic we succeed in cancel half of our debt which accumul while were build our infrastructur from a near zero point thi will remain our pledg and commit as we step into the 21st centuri and particip with other state in establish a new world order the emphasi of big and small state alik is gener turn from polit and militari affair to econom issu and concern in thi connect we note two import phenomena that requir us to open our mind and devot our think to the altern avail to us to deal with them and with their effect on our nation interest the first phenomenon is repres by the rapid chang that have occur recent in the field of intern trade mani peopl ask what thi gatt is i believ the economi minist can explain thi issu on televis the recent round of uruguai multilater talk result in the sign of an import agreement which will result in draw up the cours of trade exchang among world state for the come decad thi agreement wa approv in marrakesh on 15 april the second phenomenon is the tendenc of mani state in the variou contin to establish huge econom bloc that will make it difficult for small and isol entiti to run their econom and trade relat effici and effect unless thei take the necessari measur to deal with thi new situat in view of the polit and technic complic surround these two phenomena we must not hesit to assess them and to draft the polici we will follow in confront their effect on us and the fratern countri with whom we share uniti of interest and fate particularli the arab fratern countri and the african countri therefor i decid to make these two topic an object of meticul and in depth studi that doe not focu on theoret issu but on aspect that ar us in chart polici and adopt the stand that ar effect in protect our pan arab interest sinc these two issu should be submit to the variou offici and popular group and institut for gener discuss i believ that the labor feder must effect particip in thi work applaus becaus it would not be fair for such issu to be decid far from the concept and principl of the labor base move on to the middl east peac process we find that posit sign give rise to hope that 1994 will be the year in which we find a comprehens and last peac on everi track start with the palestinian track on which the two side made great stride by sign the oslo washington and cairo agreement and agre on most detail for set up the palestinian

concern peopl confid in the inevit of the victori of peac and the influenc of stabil and secur against the tendenc toward violenc reject and impot brother and sister our high hope for a brighter futur

FBIS4-68591: cso discuss with gennadii melikyan russian feder minist of labor by the rossiyskaya gazeta editori collect under the rubric in the first person place and date not given gennadii melikyan the duti of the state is to provid a job and a wage text start todai we ar begin the public of item under the new rubric in the first person in which statesmen public figur and politician will make statement the first item is devot to a meet between the editori collect and russian feder minist of labor gennadii melikyan melikyan thing social and econom ar dualist on cannot be separ from the other thi is why i would like to begin with thi interdepend right awai the troubl is that under the current circumst enterpris if thei have fund ar strive to alloc them for current consumpt primarili wage thi is why the averag wage at rich enterpris especi in the fuel and energi complex ha alreadi exceed 1 million the rel poor enterpris behav in virtual the same manner it is just that their potenti is smaller thi situat is a direct consequ of unsettl ownership arrang enterpris ar free which includ have the freedom to us avail fund howev there is no effect owner who is interest in accumul fund rather than eat awai at them the state ha withdrawn from monitor the effect of the us of it state grace the share of joint stock compani at least those of mani of them ar dispers among thousand of sharehold frequent the control bloc of share is held by the labor collect whose member current perceiv themselv as hire labor rather than owner therefor their main interest is to increas current incom rather than accumul capit inde we have suppress inflat somewhat we have suppress it to a degre artifici and then by quit uncivil method in a number of case by not pai grant by depriv the budget financ sphere of fund by not pai for product order by the state and so on inde we have succeed in financi stabil for the third month run inflat ha been at the level of 9 percent thi had not been the case for a long time in gener there ar posit and neg aspect to each of the process current underwai we have suppress inflat but what ha thi led to in product the volum of product is in a free fall down 25 percent in the first quarter what is the result of the fall the taxabl base is shrink budget revenu ar diminish accordingli ultim we either have to agre to a greater budget deficit which will trigger inflat or will be forc to cut back expenditur yet again you suppress inflat and incom fall thi is classic to an even greater degre we ar worri about what mai happen to product itself especi employ after all thing such as nonpay and employ ar veri strongli connect previous we had nonpay of a greater size than we have now that is of cours if thei ar adjust for the price index howev nonpay ar differ at present enterpris us to have the abil to wiggl their wai out of it somehow nonpay ar actual afflict product directli in 1992 and 1993 our enterpris stop too though not as mani as have stop now thi wa primarili associ with a shortag of raw materi and subcontract part the sever of econom relat wa a factor what ar product stoppag associ with at present effect demand is absent it is imposs to sell product thi pattern follow product facil shut down becaus of lack of fund and mass unemploy set in enterpris will shut down anywai even if our drawn out bankruptci arrang is not fulli us in the process some enterpris object face the imposs of oper normal becaus of sharp chang in price ratio if we look at the two year and three month sinc the begin of price liber price for variou good have increas veri differ dure thi period the rise ha been meteor in the case of energi resourc and transport the rate of growth in the food industri and a number of other industri ha been much smaller all of thi ha brought about a segment of the economi be ineffici rossiyskaya gazeta howev might thi have been foreseen perhap melikyan it might have after all the structur of the economi of the union evolv in a certain price environ with energi transport etc be cheap if we proce rapidli along the path of liber and the price ratio chang thi mean that the question of what to do about certain part of the economi for exampl transport should be answer director of the institut of project yurii yeremenko demonstr the possibl consequ of a rapid liber of price as earli as the late 1980 s on of hi conclus wa precis that thi would unavoid bring about either the collaps of a part of the economi or the need to artifici support some enterpris by wai of grant thi is why mani peopl suggest at the time let us chang the structur of the economi in stage us central method bring thi structur closer to the on that should be evolv in the environ of a market economi and unrestrict price price should be extens liber at a later stage howev it wa imposs to implement these propos in the period in which thei were made the polit power and influenc of the militari industri complex would have actual made it imposs to carri out broad scale restructur in the economi that is to sai thi wa a typic exampl of how the economi wa ti to the polit structur of our societi later the right time wa miss i am profoundli convinc that after the august event of 1991 it wa no longer possibl to prevent the collaps of the economi without liber price it is just that there wa no adequ administr power for it and in the absenc of such for exampl price control cannot be impos that is to sai stage by stage liber in the economi had alreadi becom imposs and it is so at present we sai from the point of view of econom it ought to be that wai inde it ought to meanwhil social constraint oper in their own wai recent we debat the miner what we ar proceed to do actual run counter to all econom logic in everi sens of the word what ar we do we ar alloc tremend grant the coal industri ha now been alloc grant for the year come to almost 8 trillion rubl r how will thei be distribut all enterpris of the industri have been segreg into group those that ar more effici and oper under good mine and geolog condit those whose produc cost is low these enterpris will not get anyth who will get the bulk of the grant those whose condit ar bad whose coal is hard to mine and whose produc cost ar high rossiyskaya gazeta that is to sai we tradition support the weak of cours there is a need for that howev from the econom standpoint it is pernici not to offer incent to the strong is it not melikyan natur after all tremend resourc ar channel in the process to the sphere that produc no return therefor the overal effect of the economi declin howev do we have an altern perhap onli that of close down the weak enterpris howev in thi case i will go back to what i have said what ar we to do about the peopl ar we to promot unemploy and crime be mistrust of everyon we did our own calcul of cours it turn out that the standard of live ha fallen quit percept especi in 1992 by about 30 percent in 1993 a slow correct began howev we ar still far from the prereform period in the latest period we have succeed in solv just on problem peopl who live below the subsist minimum have begun to live somewhat better thi is accord to survei receiv in februari howev the improv is temporari prior to februari it happen in decemb we made special purpos payment and thei zero in precis on the least affluent three avenu were involv first a system of allow for children wa modifi and the allow were increas the allow end up in low incom famili second wage in the budget financ sector were rais in decemb howev the bulk of addit payment fell on the begin of the year and thi produc result compens for retire were also increas the situat chang a littl bit right awai it mai still linger howev a few month from now everyth will come back to the wai it wa unless new measur ar taken rossiyskaya gazeta gennadii georgiyevich our editori offic ha an itar tass report quot your ministri which sai that 40 percent of our popul live below the poverti line in our countri melikyan it is not so dure all of 1993 there were fluctuat between 27 and 35 percent in februari a sharp decreas occur accord to survei 16 7 to 17 percent live below the subsist minimum in march the minimum came to r60 000 thi is the averag rossiyskaya gazeta mani peopl predict an explos of strike and mass discont in the spring do you believ that thi is realist melikyan perhap better than ani other ministri our feel how when and where social tension build for exampl last year we predict the situat sever month in advanc with the greatest accuraci thi wa not difficult becaus all of our interrelationship with the trade union indic that prepar for conflict in the fall were underwai thei began to form strike committe in the region facilit committe and committe for the struggl to improv the live condit of the work peopl we determin right awai when the explos wa go to happen thi time there were prepar too and thei thought that the explos would occur in april to be sure the explos of discont among the miner and their arriv here were organ by the corp of director rather than the trade union the struggl for grant is on the ministri of financ propos subsidi exceed r5 trillion the coal industri peopl demand first r14 trillion and then r11 trillion the struggl began the director were ostens on the sidelin rossiyskaya gazeta howev ar our trade union and the corp of director actual unit melikyan ye i ask myself with what fund had almost 550 peopl travel here how much doe maintain on person at a moscow hotel cost at present thei took offens howev in thi case i will stick to my convict frankli i am apprehens about the fall much depend on how we ar go to behav why did i begin with the gener situat and with the fact that we have contain inflat i am afraid that the romanian scenario might occur let us recal the period befor thei toppl ceausescu thei also squeez incom for a certain limit period of time came close to repai the foreign debt and solv mani other financi problem howev ultim the spring snap rossiyskaya gazeta what is your attitud toward the presid s edict on the respons of manag for failur to pai wage as far as you know ha there been a surg of directori indign melikyan the issu of nonpay ar alwai fundament at present thei ar on of the main reason for social tension all of you rememb the 1992 nonpay when price were decontrol thei were associ with a lack of cash the absenc of cash now account for 0 4 percent of unpaid wage gerashchenko assur us that in case in which thei refer to a shortag of monei it is just a lack of dispatch on the part of local bank and thi is inde so howev at present no payment ar be made becaus enterpris do not have fund rossiyskaya gazeta appar in thi instanc we should take into account who the employe sign labor contract with melikyan correct thei sign the contract with the manag of enterpris under the law the manag should pai the grant at the establish time in gener the manag should take the first blow if the collect is dissatisfi there ar word in the code of labor law the code on statutori violat and the crimin code accord to which charg mai be file against the manag of an enterpris for fail to pai wage but on the condit that some kind of premedit is detect premedit doe occur for exampl an attempt to provok a strike incident thi wa how prepar were made for octob of thi year as publish specif prepar were made so that fund would not be credit to the account of enterpris but rather be put to us elsewher meanwhil their own employe were told that there wa no monei for exampl i am awar of an enterpris that is not pai wage but ha foreign exchang and a lot of it so sell it no wai anoth enterpris hold share for exampl in the avtobank their convers into cash is elementari sell them thei will not in mani case the manag do not wish to do so and dig in their heel howev i am far from think that the govern is absolut without blame in thi instanc if the nonpay of wage afflict 8 or even 12 percent of the enterpris here i could sai that thi is the director concern as it is you have work poorli and have fail to ensur the regular organ of product and now you answer to the collect howev when thi process involv 30 40 percent of enterpris we ar look at a gener econom disloc thi mean that someth in the system is wrong recent an acquaint of mine the director of a metallurg combin visit i told him that i knew who he wa not pai miner had ship coal he had receiv it and wa sit tight i shame him but he laugh stop pick on me with those moral principl of your he said we supposedli no longer have them in our economi so he said i will withhold payment for as long as i can rossiyskaya gazeta howev thi actual amount to interest free credit he doe not pai the mine the mine cannot pai the worker other do not pai on anoth in the same wai what can a system of econom sanction be in thi instanc what step should the state take melikyan previous we had mani mechan there wa a calendar sequenc of payment out of the fund taken in by enterpris in addit there wa a blockag rule with regard to wage if paydai wa draw nearer a certain amount of wage had to be retain in the account and not remit anywher thi wa later abandon the sequenc of payment is now such as the enterpris itself resolv to have plu there ar prioriti payment for exampl to the budget have you notic that a proport of wage ar be paid in kettl pot and iron why is thi happen becaus the director doe not want thi monei to be credit to the account sinc it will be drain awai by tax right awai we have now propos to again block some of the fund for wage in enterpris account of cours not all the fund but at least six time the minimum wage or four time the minimum wage in the extrem follow a protract debat with the ministri of financ we agre that such block can amount to no more than on half of the fund that should be remit to the feder budget after all the budget should be replenish too if the budget lack fund organ that ar financ by the state for exampl school hospit and so on will experi problem rossiyskaya gazeta wa the ministri of financ natur afraid of do in the budget financ sphere if the moni were claim by wage melikyan precis thi is why we reach thi compromis and i still hope that thi system will be implement howev it will not save the dai complet but will mere improv the situat rossiyskaya gazeta thi is certainli a coerciv administr decis melikyan of cours thi problem should have been resolv radic in a differ manner for exampl by shake loos the nonpay howev given that 27 percent of our enterpris have a neg balanc at present even a mutual offset will indic that mani will still be left with a neg valu what is to be done about them ar thei to be close down some will have to be close down although i believ that the closur is not the main point thi threat should hang over the enterpris and it manag and prompt them to hustl and look for reserv and work opportun unfortun at present a consider proport of the effort doe not go into that but rather into an attempt to cover high cost by rais price thi wa the case befor for the most part at present in the environ of limit effect demand opportun to greatli overst price have diminish for mani enterpris especi non monopoli opportun for increas nonpay a varieti of interest free commerci credit ar likewis limit thi is why the pressur on the govern includ demand for easi credit grant and variou relief ha clearli increas i think that we will have to proce to support a number of enterpris of cours thi will bring about a certain growth of inflat let it be 12 14 percent a month rather than 8 9 percent and let restructur advanc more slowli but mai there not be a mass stoppag of enterpris and cataclysm unemploy that is to sai we will continu to transform our economi more smoothli and at a lower sociopolit cost ani attempt to do everyth in on fell swoop endang all reform altogeth of cours my economist colleagu might accus me of deviat from econom expedi howev the wisdom of practic polici is found precis in take into account the entir spectrum of relat rather than onli the narrowli econom segment no matter how superior it signific is howev i am categor oppos to turn thi countri into a univers welfar depart thi would be harm to us all some time ago we survei 140 enterpris surpris thing came out for exampl everyon is talk about a sharp increas in the cost of energi resourc howev enterpris at which ani special system of incent for save energi resourc and expens materi ar in effect ar few and far between here is the answer to mani question for you thi is why i will sai onc again we should help but in the process at least two condit should obtain first an appeal for help should automat call into question the compet of the enterpris manag for the posit thei hold thi is not to sai that the director should be dismiss immedi or that the meet of sharehold should be requir to take thi step there ar object reason and thei should be consid howev each manag should feel person respons for the financi stand of hi enterpris second assist should be provid sole in conjunct with specif program for the develop of the enterpris rossiyskaya gazeta support for enterpris through the implement of specif program is on of the direct for an overal recoveri in the economi howev there ar such avenu in the social sphere too ar there not melikyan i am profoundli convinc that we have fail in ensur that for exampl hous becom on of the engin of the economi if we act as we ar now either provid hous free of charg or sell it at full cost thing will not get move a veri narrow circl is abl to purchas hous at full cost in our countri even on an instal plan thi is why there must be some kind of state support it will pai for itself we will prompt peopl to make monei becaus mani ar prepar to appli themselv for the sake of hous and appli themselv all the wai we should take advantag of that i am profoundli convinc that we have allow an entir sequenc of mistak to occur at the initi stage of the reform we have allow mistak to occur and we should acknowledg them rossiyskaya gazeta which mistak do you consid to have been the main on melikyan it wa the notion that the invis hand of the market would do everyth all by itself and that everyth could be done in on fell swoop i also believ the anticipatori increas in incom at the end of 1991 prior to the liber of price to have been a seriou mistak there is a lot in the shatalin yavlinskii program 500 dai and other program from thi period that we might disagre with howev all of them emphas ty up the monei prior to the liber of price for our part we did the opposit in the last month of 1991 we not onli fail to tie up monetari save and incom but said that there would be a price increas and therefor anticip yet anoth increas in wage retir benefit and so on do you rememb what we got as a result in novemb and decemb 1991 rossiyskaya gazeta howev price also took off in anticip of wage increas melikyan at that time we also adopt the thesi that incom do not have to be regul we had level all the time it wa said and now we would decontrol incom thei would be whatev thei end up be rossiyskaya gazeta ar you of the opinion that price incom and the economi in gener should be regul melikyan of cours there ar no countri without such regul the degre and the method ar at issu for exampl through the taxat of the individu incom of citizen howev the present dai mechan for individu taxat of citizen is not work we ar not a switzerland not even an america we need a lengthi period of time for peopl to learn to fill out return to be law abid and to indic all their incom so the mechan is not work look at how the mechan is structur let us assum that i make r500 000 and you make r50 000 the same 12 percent is withheld from us all the time until my r500 000 salari add up to r5 million it will reach thi level as late as novemb and the differ in the collect of tax will begin as late as novemb thei will withhold 20 percent from me as late as novemb and then onli from the novemb wage my wage for the 10 month will remain tax at 12 percent rossiyskaya gazeta should we expect thi mechan to be revis mani time yet melikyan undoubtedli rossiyskaya gazeta what is the import of thi from the point of view of social polici melikyan monei cannot be wast right and left it wa stupid to proclaim the thesi that we will pursu a nonmonetari polici instead of a monetari polici all thi is far fetch it cannot be pursu instead it can onli be pursu as an addit of cours it is necessari to take social factor into account we cannot ignor them at present we cannot influenc enterpris in the sphere not financ from the budget as far as wage ar concern we have adopt a pai scale for the budget financ sphere whether it is good or bad howev there ar no particular mechan for the sphere not financ from the budget to be sure there is a certain impact through the pai scale agreement which is technic in part becaus we still do not have owner given that repres of both the employ and the trade union demand from us that wage be increas a conclus mai be drawn from thi as to what the real employ is in our countri actual he is a hire employe and all of them ar now demand give it to us and that s it rossiyskaya gazeta you have touch on the topic of mutual relat among trade union employ and the state the problem of the trilater commiss melikyan it di down dure a certain period it wa dead right after the putsch later we decid to bring back thi trilater commiss after all we cannot do without negoti without a search for accord and compromis conflict dictat and tension ar the altern howev a problem develop in put togeth the trade union side we now have about 70 variou trade union thei just could not agre thi drag on for sever month howev the commiss began to oper recent a new coordin deputi prime minist yurii yarov wa confirm by an edict of the presid we succeed in sign the gener agreement between trade union employ and the govern there were mani problem and there still ar we ar try to solv them gradual the trade union did not ultim come to an agreement within the new represent either some of them withdrew in principl we have yet to sort thing out with mani trade union we sometim try to make us of a readi made mechan such as it exist in the west howev employ ar absolut differ there their employ ar the owner or repres of the owner thei know that if thei rais your wage it will be done out of their profit or their wallet thi is why thei fight you in our countri it so happen that the employ and the trade union ar on on side and the govern is on the other logic the govern should not be take part in thi debat it role is sort of that of a justic of the peac a guarantor who see to it that the rule of the game ar compli with in a regular manner so that thei do not devour each other howev at present the govern cannot stand asid if it remain on the sidelin the wage situat in some industri especi monopolist on will be even wors than now take power gener thei both the trade union and the employ would set such pai rate for themselv that thei would seem sky high to us the same would happen in other industri becaus there is no object confront here there should be such between the employ and the trade union besid the trade union themselv ar pardon me not entir normal you will agre that both the employe and the director should not happen to be member of the same trade union incident i am try to preach an idea which mani of my colleagu do not like the idea of strong trade union rossiyskaya gazeta gennadii georgiyevich do you have a program for extinguish social conflict melikyan we ar organ a servic for settl collect labor disput so far it is veri small but territori subdivis ar alreadi be establish incident the head of administr of virtual all the region ar ask us to organ someth of thi natur in their area too rossiyskaya gazeta doe thi look like a trade union melikyan no it is precis a mediat servic it can subsequ becom a neutral panel of labor arbitr a court we ar now rais the issu of creat a legal inspector labor legisl is be violat by and larg the procuraci provid gener oversight but the labor inspector should specif verifi complianc with labor norm incident such inspector exist everywher in on form or anoth if there were a formid inspector the situat with both occup safeti and the payment of wage would be somewhat differ the trade union legal and technic inspector have begun to retrogress littl by littl especi after the social insur fund wa taken awai from them rossiyskaya gazeta is thi to sai that the legal inspector will be your subdivis melikyan we ar in favor but at present the disput is on rossiyskaya gazeta what about the occup safeti inspector thei have also collaps after all melikyan we were entrust with thi busi on a temporari basi recent i wa confirm as the chairman of the appropri interdepartment commiss i think that thi function will be assign to us altogeth what doe everyth hing on there ar two document stand in the wai first there is basic legisl on occup safeti it wa put togeth in a veri unfortun manner it call for the establish of yet anoth new structur which would provid control and supervis over occup safeti i believ thi to be absolut superflu the ministri of labor or anoth exist organ mai be entrust with relev function rossiyskaya gazeta is the function of the blue helmet which you have assum temporari melikyan do you mean the servic for settl collect labor disput hardli so experi indic that even well off countri have similar servic it is just that at some stage thei have been transform into someth akin to labor arbitr moreov the american for exampl now have labor arbitr within the organ of the depart of labor rossiyskaya gazeta is thi why you also intend to take over the employ servic melikyan i believ that a mistak wa allow to occur when the ministri of labor wa split into three independ structur is it the busi of the employ servic to develop a labor market polici no thi is the busi of gener econom polici for it part the employ servic should organ registr of the unemploi payment of benefit retrain and job placement the ministri of labor will thu be assembl under on roof rossiyskaya gazeta when the struggl for chang in our societi began we veri much want to escap from the dictat of the state and transfer mani function to societi we want the public not to be depriv of it right to the degre it us to be it is now come out that mani servic have been taken awai from the public and we ar transfer them to the state melikyan let us recal thi when too mani gift were bestow upon the trade union thei

drag out for week and credit were not be grant thi stage s polit background wa the confront with the suprem soviet up to the event of 3 4 octob and then the prepar for the elect the fifth stage wa the period after 12 decemb 1993 the elect result were us by some as a signal for a shift in the financi and econom polici mani of those who had sworn to be faith to the cours of the reform began talk about the need for a greater social orient and a chang in prioriti make statement like more therapi and less shock as a result almost noth occur dure thi period although the desir to dip into the central bank s profit intensifi and the consult on the new make up of the govern began thi shift in no wai ensu from the year s actual econom result and even the elect result themselv were by far not as bad as some ar try to make them out sinc the number of support of sensibl financi and econom polici increas in comparison with the former suprem soviet the lack of a normal function parliament over the cours of sever month demonstr the need for a counterweight to execut power dozen of new spend decis pour out includ for the support of the apparat and unfound and uncontrol expenditur for purpos of no import for the countri unfortun the start of the duma s work is still not inspir optim for the futur 1 2 the ministri of financ s posit the russian ministri of financ over the cours of 1993 tri to pursu moder financi and econom polici aim at a rel reduct of the budget deficit a tighten up of the monetari polici and correspond measur in the currenc sphere in order to reduc inflat a concept wa adopt accord to which under the condit of high inflat real invest and save ar imposs the shortag of work capit and the non payment will not disappear and a rise in product is imposs and under the exist polit condit it is imposs to achiev a radic rapid lower of inflat i e the tactic of progress movement have been select especi sinc the market infrastructur ha still not taken it final shape as is obviou no kind of shock wa envis a premis wa adopt within the framework of thi concept about the intoler of mutual credit and the replenish of work capit through emiss sinc in addit to the inflationari effect thi will slow down the structur reorgan and take awai from the enterpris the incent for increas labor product and effici as a whole an achiev of 1993 is the fact that we manag to avoid the credit and index of work capit although the central bank constantli push thi idea and tri to persuad the govern 1 3 sever myth over the cours of all of 1993 the greatest disput were caus by the follow question which have been transform into distinct myth what is first financi stabil or a rise in product what is the natur of inflat in russia and should there be more or less social orient at the same time the polici pursu by the govern wa declar to be monetarist a polici of shock therapi and so on the major of the indic myth ar base on the oppon lack of understand of the basic abc of a market economi a typic exampl of thi ignor is price in 1992 increas by a factor of 26 while the m3 monei suppli increas by a factor of 10 and thi mean that there is not enough monei in the economi the first myth spring from a basic principl of social the primaci of product over the sphere of servic and turnov which were declar to be secondari thi ordinari kind of logic sai that first it is necessari to rais product and to produc good and inflat itself will disappear ani restrict of the deficit and credit is perceiv as anti product and even on which lead to an increas in inflat for exampl an increas in interest rate lead to an increas in price such delus ar encount in the west also and in the twenti peopl s commissar of financ g sokolnikov surround by red econom manag struggl with them the support of a rise in product alwai forget to sai how thei intend to rais it monei and credit ar need for thi and thei can be obtain quickli onli through an increas in the deficit and through emiss which will increas inflat and devalu invest and work capit which will have to be replenish anew through emiss and so on ad infinitum the refer to keyn erhard and japan ar ignor no sensibl person anywher ha recommend the stimul of product through emiss in germani and japan after the war the budget deficit were not fund through emiss the second myth consist of the incant like repetit by the execut of the central bank and other of the thesi that inflat in russia is of a non monetari consumpt natur which is associ with the high degre of monopol of the economi and the absenc of competit the so call cost push inflat is set off against the demand pull inflat the inflat of the cost of product against the inflat of demand actual inflat doe not have a singl solitari caus and monopol make it possibl to increas price groundlessli howev in our instanc it is evid that the degre of monopol of the economi is rapidli diminish competit is develop rapidli includ through import and there is a proven direct connect between the size of the monei suppli and the rate of price increas it mai be said with good reason that in 1993 monetari factor made up someth on the order of 70 75 percent of the inflat while the remaind wa made up of the expenditur mechan the currenc exchang rate and other factor the enterpris behavior is becom more and more market orient and thei ar begin to draw closer to reduc expens and increas labor product as thei understand that there will no longer be ani free handout from the state the third myth is associ with the alleg that the polici be pursu is shock therapi and a monetarist experi and doe not have a social orient thi also doe not correspond to realiti first on the basi of ani kind of criteria it is imposs to regard as shock therapi a polici under which a budget deficit amount to 10 percent of the gdp is be fund through emiss inflat over the year amount to 900 percent the public s monetari incom and the averag wage in all sector increas faster than price did unemploy remain at the level of 1 percent there ar no bankruptci and enterpris close and the consumpt of all type of foodstuff and mani consum good ha increas second for the same reason the accus of a harsh monetarist polici is unfound the critic in an absolut major of instanc do not have the slightest understand of monetar as a theori and do not understand that given the lack of desir on the part of the central bank and the lack of the basic instrument of a monetari polici a real monetarist polici is simpli imposs we ar at the stage where the broad variabl of the economi ar be brought into line with common sens in order to do thi it is necessari to reduc the budget deficit and to fund it by civil mean to chang the budget s structur decreas in it the share of ineffici subsidi to reduc central credit convert it into normal refinanc in favor of normal bank credit and to bring interest rate into line with inflat therebi establish a basi for save and invest and so on at the same time we ar talk about elimin to the maximum extent the factor which distort the effect of market forc and lower the effect of state fund and monetari regul the mass subsid of credit import subsidi the withdraw from the budget of enorm sum in the form of non budget control fund credit and subsidi and tax break currenc benefit and foreign econom benefit the flight of capit dollar the us of dollar and the grati distribut of credit and cash in the rubl zone and the covert subsid of foreign state through price and tax evas and other item all thi is necessari in order to convert the currenc exchang rate the interest rate tax and the budget into real econom regul onli after these task ar carri out will it be possibl to talk about the develop of an actual refin monetarist polici or some other monetari polici when the struggl proce with the restrict of all credit and not just central credit the fourth myth is about the construct of a social orient market economi base on the number of differ social orient measur russia probabl surpass all the other countri of the world by sever factor there ar the continu index abov the inflat level and the dozen of grant benefit and subsidi the problem is that the major of these subsidi and benefit do not have a clearli identifi recipi and ar be distribut to millionair and the realli indig alik the benefit have been and ar be given out irrespect of actual mean and without consider of avail financi and other resourc if all the peopl were to attempt to come and to get all the benefit which exist on paper then we would need two more budget a signific portion of health care and educ and a number of other area which had not been reform even after the start of the reform ar leftov from the old system which ar attempt to surviv under the new condit thi mean extrem low effici inflat staff low qualiti and a lack of incent thi is precis why altern educ and medic system on a privat and paid basi ar spread so swiftli thi is why we should not talk about a mythic social orient but rather about a radic reform of social secur health care educ increas the specif tailor of state assist public work the support of small busi program for retrain specialist and mani other item the polici of financi stabil and the polici of econom reform have as the final goal onli on thing rais the standard of live and the qualiti of life through product effici and maximum ration in the distribut of financi and other resourc thi is why ani attempt to oppos financi stabil and social protect ar ignor and shortsight 1 4 the polit opposit the larg problem of russia s financi and econom polici in 1993 were associ with the complet lack of uniti and basic financi disciplin in the execut power especi consid the continu confront with the repres power the pre elect struggl at year s end confirm that the govern from the veri start wa a coalit unit within itself peopl with diametr oppos view give rise to constant conflict it is clear that achiev larg result in thi situat is complic the undermin of the financi stabil polici is directli associ with the continu unfulfil promis of the repres and execut power the suprem soviet continu adopt deliber impract law in the race for popular in the ey of the voter want to annoi the govern and the presid as much as possibl it is stagger but for exampl the law on grain

uniqu phenomenon in world practic sinc even despit the clear word in the constitut and the law it resist the fulfil of it own respons in the struggl against inflat and adher to the ideolog of the red econom manag and thi is why it basic doe not want to fulfil the function of a real central bank over the cours of the year the ministri of financ had to resort mani time to the method of public pressur on the central bank in order to forc it to pursu a reason polici on the whole thi wa success especi when polit factor help but thi occur with resist delai and provoc although a mutual understand did occur as a rule on the specialist level without a solut to the problem of the central bank in 1994 it will be imposs to count on a success financi and econom polici on the whole base on 1993 s result it is possibl to draw the follow conclus 1 in 1993 the govern pursu a more consist and effect financi polici which is confirm by the specif result analyz in the report russia s economi is rapidli reorgan and it can be regul us market orient method 2 the inadequ percept result first of all ar explain by the execut power s intern conflict the lack of understand and the unwilling of part of the leadership to carri out the need reform and the incompat of the financi agrarian and industri polici 2 the year s basic econom result in 1993 it wa not possibl to sustain fulli the financi and econom polici orient toward lower inflat and stabil the economi therefor although we avoid the ukrain of the russian economi the major of set paramet wa not achiev at the same time within the framework of thi moder polici some progress wa achiev the rate of inflat in decemb amount to less than 13 percent per month in comparison with the 25 30 percent at the begin of the year but the trend wa not clear and a strong burst of inflat wa note in the summer the ratio of net domest asset to the gdp decreas domest fund of the budget deficit decreas from 19 percent in 1992 to 5 percent and foreign fund decreas from 17 percent to 4 percent the rubl exchang rate stabil and approach pariti with purchas power wage increas in term of dollar import subsidi were elimin and the transit to a

the rate of increas drop in march through june and later in septemb through decemb at the begin of the year and in august the rate of increas in price reach almost 30 percent per month over the year as a whole from decemb to decemb price increas by an approxim factor of 10 as against a factor of 26 in 1992 the develop of inflat process in the first half of the year occur to a larg extent due to the influenc of the emiss inflat of the monei turnov in the fall of the preced year after conduct mutual credit of the debt of state enterpris and other decis which intensifi inflat expect thi period

in deposit interest rate and the inclin toward save began to increas as a result the degre of monet of the economi began to increas and the rate of inflat began to decreas but the ministri of financ began to be subject to ever fiercer pressur the demand for monei subsidi and loan intensifi the on go event make it possibl to draw the conclus that what is take shape is a distinct economi strain inflat cycl as soon as favor result ar successfulli achiev due to the pressur of the sectori lobbi and polit event there follow a breakdown which then make it necessari to intensifi anew the struggl against inflat it is believ that the hyperinfl threshold is at the level of 50 percent per month in point of fact even an averag rate of inflat of 20 percent per month is catastroph russia ha been live under the condit of hyperinfl for 2 year now and on achiev of the polici pursu is the fact that the situat ha not becom much wors if decis measur ar not adopt in 1994 then save invest and the

profit into budget of all level increas to 49 9 percent as against 46 7 percent in 1992 which entail an increas in the revenu from thi tax as a share of the gdp the increas in the taxabl profit base basic occur through an increas in the amount of the wage fund abov it standard valu and a reduct in the share of depreci allow in the product cost of product tabl 2 budget system revenu in 1992 and

problem of the overal tax burden remain the most pain matter of the tax polici it is be assert that tax ar smother the produc that the tax burden is unbear and so on the list figur testifi to the fact that the total tax burden in russia in 1993 decreas in comparison with 1992 although it is somewhat higher in comparison with the world s develop countri the numer suggest about lower tax in order to stimul the economi ar not caus ani major object except for on how to compens the budget for the drop in revenu if it is compens for through a reduct in spend then thi can be welcom but if it is compens for through emiss then thi is a catastroph for the economi the experi of the past year show that a lower of tax and everi possibl kind of tax break did not lead to an increas in product in a singl sector of the nation economi and if the tax stimul of invest had an effect then it size doe not lend itself to statist evalu a seriou problem dure the rais of the revenu portion of the republ budget in 1993 wa the tendenc toward a sharp decreas in the share of the tax payment be paid into the republ budget in the overal amount of the gdp thu wherea the share of tax receipt in the gdp in the first quarter of 1993 amount to 16 7 percent it decreas to 12 3 percent in the second quarter to 9 percent in the third quarter and it wa 9 7 percent in the fourth quarter of cours it is not entir correct to compar the 1993 result with the data for 1992 s second half when inflationari pump up of the economi occur under the influenc of the mutual credit carri out but the trend itself is obviou the basic caus of thi process wa the lower begin as of 1 januari 1993 of the rate for the valu ad tax from 28 percent to 20 percent which wa not compens for by an increas in other tax the effect of thi factor began to be track clearli as of march 1993 and especi as of mai when the recalcul of tax base on the result of the preced year wa complet but undoubtedli thi factor wa not the onli on and thi is confirm by the decreas in tax receipt which continu up to the end of the year onli the decreas in the inflat rate at year s end influenc a chang in thi tendenc in the short term the increas in the collect of tax as a share of the gdp given the decreas inflat is explain by the techniqu for remit the tax payment in our opinion it is possibl to find sever more factor which have caus such a develop of event it is imposs not to acknowledg the fact that the tax collect system is oper poorli over the cours of the year there wa a steadi increas in the arrear for payment into the budget accord to the state tax servic s data base on the statu on 1 januari 1994 as a whole for the republ budget thei amount to r1 8 trillion includ r1 0 trillion for the valu ad tax r500 billion for the profit tax and r300 billion for the payment for the us of miner and natur resourc thi is especi notic in the exampl of the excis tax the introduct over the cours of 1993 of excis tax for oil and ga did not lead to an increas in actual receipt as a percentag of the gdp or in price deflat by the rate of increas from thi type of tax in comparison with 1992 s first quarter when in point of fact the excis tax had just been introduc appar we should talk about the fact that the taxpay have found veri widespread opportun for tax evas against which it is necessari to begin to conduct a struggl in the veri near futur it must be note that due to the pressur from the sectori lobbi the excis tax rate for oil for five of the largest produc the share of which exce 50 percent of the overal amount of oil product in the countri were set at the level of 8 percent when the averag rate is 24 percent the continu process of a nomin increas in non payment in the economi is have an advers impact on the tax receipt inasmuch as the valu ad tax the cornerston of the tax payment into the feder budget is be levi on the basi of the sale of product and the receipt of monei in the enterpris current account the slower settlement in the economi proce the greater the delai in the collect of thi tax and the larger the devalu of the tax receipt accord to the data of rosnalogsluzhba russian tax servic the total of the indebted for thi tax amount to around r1 3 trillion it is also imposs to disregard the practic which becam widespread in the second half of 1993 of grant mass tax defer to larg industri enterpris by the ministri of financ and local financ organ accord to the ministri of financ s data the overal amount of grant defer just for industri enterpris for the remitt of tax into the feder budget over the period from juli through decemb of 1993 came to more than r230 billion of which onli r55 billion had been paid by year s end the tax defer becam on of the basic method for financi support of industri enterpris seriou complic also exist in the collect of all type of tax from a new sector of the economi here a number of aspect ar intermingl the imperfect natur of the legisl and the avail of tax shelter the organiz weak and the low level of train of the tax worker the difficulti in record the activ of mani entrepreneur and the progress develop of cash settlement in the economi caus by the low qualiti of the system of bank clear oper and simpli the strive of mani entrepreneur to evad remit tax and so on overcom these factor will take a long time but thi task is on of the prioriti on for the state s financi system the real decreas in the share of tax receipt into the republ budget in the gdp wa accompani by the redistribut of revenu in favor of the lower level of the budget thi occur partial contrari to the law becaus of the decis of local author thu the chang for thi reason in the ratio for divid receipt from the vat in favor of the region and local budget meant a loss for the republ budget of approxim r550 billion base on the result for the year see the section budget feder 3 6 to a larg extent the underpay of revenu into the budget system is associ with the tax evas which is occur both through conceal the veri fact of econom activ through the refus to regist busi ventur and also through the falsif of the record of commerci and product enterpris and bank as a result of all thi the tendenc toward a decreas in tax revenu by the end of 1993 serious concern the govern which decid to increas the tax burden the increas in the vat rate and the rate for the profit tax and in the portion design for the feder budget it is true that at the same time a seri of decis wa made which will lead to aggrav of the situat involv the collect of tax inasmuch as thei will realli have a tell effect on the decreas in receipt from the profit tax which current in light of a number of reason amount to a veri larg figur in comparison with other eastern european countri we ar talk about a revalu of fix capit consequ the depreci allow will increas and profit will decreas an increas in the standard figur for wage from four time the minimum wage to six time the minimum wage and an increas in the level itself of the minimum wage by a factor of 1 9 as a consequ there is no reason to expect an increas in tax collect in 1994 the substanti decreas in tax receipt and the limit on the budget deficit were inevit supplement by some decreas in expenditur and an increas in non tax receipt the last of the indic process becam highli signific in the second half of 1993 when the ratio of the feder budget s overal revenu to the tax revenu without consider of custom duti increas from the level of 1 3 1 4 typic for 1992 and the begin of 1993 to 1 7 1 9 even though accord to all the methodolog canon the non tax revenu ar budget revenu and not a method for financ under russian condit the budget s non tax revenu have becom an inflat caus factor the explan is simpl there were two basic method for obtain an increas in non tax revenu the transfer of the central bank s profit into the budget and the sale of preciou metal and stone again by the central bank i e in both instanc the increas in budget revenu wa accompani by an increas in net intern asset around 3 2 percent of the gdp a littl bit less than r5 trillion wa obtain from the sale of preciou metal and stone and currenc asset of the central bank the us of the central bank s profit made up approxim 1 3 percent of the gdp r2 trillion these receipt combin amount to 4 5 percent and compens for the decreas in the share of tax receipt in the gdp but if the transfer of the central bank s profit into the budget is a method for the subsequ withdraw of emiss incom into the budget seigniorag essenti an inflat tax is even better from societi s point of view when thi profit is spent on state need rather than on the financ of the ci state and bonus for central bank staff member as wa done in 1992 then the sale of preciou metal to the central bank paid for by the central bank through emiss contain addit neg aspect first the illus is creat that there is no need to reorgan the budget fund system inasmuch as it is possibl to find the monei for fund the state s expenditur second it is obviou that the liquid reserv of preciou metal the liquid of which can be confirm by the world market ar not that larg and when reserv of dubiou or low liquid enter into the matter then we should talk about shift the burden of the problem to the bank system although thi is a separ theme we consid it necessari to note that the threat of a larg scale crisi in the bank system in russia as befor is extrem high and in it own consequ such a crisi mai be much more seriou than the industri product crisi becaus intern stabil and reserv of ani kind ar lack in the russian bank system the monitor work of the tax servic and the tax investig depart of the observ of the tax legisl had an effect on the total volum of tax receipt and other payment dure 1993 the total amount of addit payment includ penalti base on check came to approxim r2 6 trillion or 7 percent of the total amount of tax receipt 4 7 percent in 1992 conceal or underst revenu overst expenditur which ar taken into account dure the calcul of the taxabl base and incorrectli appli the tax rate and break remain the basic violat of the tax legisl the instanc of direct evas of the remitt of tax and other obligatori payment and of gross tax violat in foreign econom activ have becom more frequent for exampl after a check of these aspect of the activ of ingosstrakh foreign insur main administr r21 5 billion have been paid into the budget as have r5 5 billion and 400 000 base on the result of a check of sovfrakht freight administr and r6 billion from gorknefteorgsintez it mai be state that the struggl against tax delinqu intensifi in 1993 power structur ar be form for the tax inspector 126 000 person now and 200 000 in the futur and the tax investig depart 8 000 person now and 40 000 in the futur thei ar acquir experi and modern equip and thei ar establish contact with foreign colleagu in 1994 a sharp increas in oper effici is possibl figur 9 the dynam of book list profit and the share of it withdraw from januari figur 10 the enterpris indebted and the collect of the vat as a share of the gdp 3 4 budget expenditur the wai in which the budget fund of state expenditur in 1993 occur show the entir depth of the crisi in which the russian budget polici and russia s state financ happen to be the reason for thi is obviou while the econom reform on the whole have been proceed throughout the countri at least without slow down for 2 year now reform in the budget process have not even occur to a larg extent the lack of chang in 1992 can be explain by the disintegr of the ussr and the chang in the staff of the ministri of financ the annual cycl of budget plan and the lack of time at the end of 1991 howev from the present standpoint it is evid that these ar onli the extern caus ultim noth imped the introduct of substanti chang in the budget practic as of the middl of 1992 or the begin of 1993 but thi wa not done a quit obviou conclus come to mind the old practic of budget plan and the implement of the budget wa outdat while the reform in the govern limit themselv to the extern indic of the budget polici s success the level of the budget deficit first of all the matter of real budget reform just the realiz of which is capabl of lai a solid foundat for success in the govern s econom polici in the futur is still an even more urgent item on the agenda most alarm from the standpoint of budget polici is the fact that the budget in russia is be transform more and more from an instrument of econom polici into a tool for plug current hole and for solv short term polit problem befor a referendum or elect as a result there ar clash between the plan requir embed in the annual budget and the stream of daili decis of the govern and the presid about the necess of carri out on expenditur or anoth the latter s victori in the struggl for the budget rubl is more like but less effici it is obviou that until thi situat is overcom or restrict to the limit of the reserv fund the budget will not be abl to becom a compet instrument of econom polici but rather it will onli be summar base on the year s result as the sum of the decis on expenditur in 1993 thi situat led to the fact that the state by give prioriti to the immedi problem turn out to be in no condit to fulfil it plan decis about rais wage and about the fund of invest program and to pai for order product and mine preciou metal the bill for electr and the domest debt liabil as a result the state itself to a certain extent is initi the develop of non payment and condemn itself to a shortfal in tax the sum total of the budget expenditur is onli a cash result and the amount of budget indebted remain unknown of cours 1993 s indebted can be carri over into 1994 but it is obviou that without chang in the attitud toward the budget thi situat will be reproduc annual on an ever increas scale the next problem is the problem of the promis and the excess of the plan expenditur even in the budget plan stage spend amount ar embed in it which deliber exce the state s capabl for everi rubl of the expenditur record in the budget there is interest on the part of on depart or anoth or on group of peopl or anoth as a result the fund ar be alloc not to those who need them or for whom thei would be most effect from the viewpoint of public interest but rather to those who ar capabl of secur the support of highli place person and exert pressur on the ministri of financ when need be as a result the total amount of the republ budget s expenditur came to 75 percent of the plan budget so that dure the compil of the budget the govern at the urg of the ministri of financ in the cours of refin the budget twice sequest

the main reason for the govern s refus to grant preferenti credit 25 septemb 1993 the financi support of the agro industri complex in russia appar will still be maintain still for a quit long time to

commerci bank averag credit rate increas continu and the dispar between them increas the success rais of the central bank s rate gradual brought it closer to the market rate especi after the joint declar of the govern and the central bank of 22 mai 1993 which establish that the interest rate for central bank credit to the nation economi can not be lower than the market rate by more than 7 percent begin as of the summer the rais of the central bank s rate began to have a notic impact on the market rate and wa conduc to their consecut increas the market rate for bank credit for a term of 1 3 month increas over the year as a whole from 85 100 percent to 210 250 percent at the same time the lack of a normal bank refinanc mechan the central bank s grant of credit to the economi s sector in signific amount without repay guarante and real secur and the avail of a preferenti rate for credit to cover the budget deficit ar still prevent the central bank s rate from be convert into a realli effect instrument of monetari polici although it rais is also on of the most import reason for the slow down of inflat and the strengthen of the rubl s exchang rate the interest rate for credit and deposit in russia differ substanti by region and as a rule thei ar higher in region distant from the main bank center therefor the most import task in the area of the interest polici should be the format of a unifi and effici credit market in 1993 the format wa begun of a market for short term monei a gko state short term bond market and a fairli larg number of site for trade interbank credit emerg but thi is still extrem inadequ the central bank s plan for organizingon credit auction in 1993 remain unreal the central bank refinanc rate and inflat in 1993 in character the result of the monetari polici attent must be paid to the fact that even the loan rate over the cours of almost all of 1993 exclud decemb remain substanti below the inflat level and thi is why the gener dissatisfact with the too high interest rate ha no econom basi whatsoev the most indic thing in our countri is comparison on a monthli basi but even if the intern methodolog with capit of interest is appli to the central bank s rate then 210 percent is equival to just 600 percent while price over the year increas by nearli 900 percent a shortcom is the fact that the float interest rate techniqu a differ type

1994 which reflect the substanti gamut of opinion in thi area the socio econom consequ of these altern version were also calcul the first of the examin version assum the abandon of the widespread idea that the problem of structur reorgan can be solv through emiss especi when condit have not been creat for effici us of the financi resourc in the real world therefor in the first stage it is necessari to solv precis these problem the attain of effici in the us of financi resourc in the economi first of all is associ with progress in two direct the institut transform and the acquisit by monei of real valu through support favor interest rate for credit to the economi abandon the widespread us of grati emiss and as a consequ bring inflat to a low level accord to the first version it would be advis to gradual reduc the central bank s credit emiss in relat to the gdp further by a factor of approxim 3 in comparison with 1993 bring it down to 5 percent of the gdp in the fourth quarter of thi year in thi instanc an averag monthli inflat of around 5 6 percent would be achiev as earli as summer the rubl s exchang rate rel to the dollar in the year s second half would amount to r2 000 2 500 to the dollar the decreas in the gdp in real term over the cours of the first quarter would be quit consider in essenc thi ha alreadi been program by the economi s sluggish howev in the subsequ period it would be possibl to count on the stabil of it amount in real term on the whole over the year the gdp volum would decreas by 8 10 percent decemb to decemb the peopl s actual incom after a slight drop in the first quarter over the year as a whole might increas by anoth 10 percent i e approxim the same as for 1993 the second version calcul by the ministri of financ assum that the govern would continu the emiss support of product but that it would us thi mechan moder the central bank s credit emiss in thi version would amount to 9 10 percent of the gdp in the year s first half and would decreas by a factor of 1 5 by year s end thi would make it possibl to fix the averag monthli inflat level achiev by year s end at 11 12 percent and to maintain a favor refinanc interest rate the drop in the gdp would also continu over the year as a whole and would amount to around 7 9 percent the peopl s actual incom would remain at 1993 s level the rubl s exchang rate would increas more slowli than inflat and would amount to r4 500 5 000 to the dollar by year s end within the framework of thi version just as in the preced on the possibl of construct cooper with intern financi organ and of obtain real financi aid and assist in the restructur of the foreign debt would be preserv the next version reflect the situat which actual emerg by the end of januari of 1994 a recoil from the moder harsh monetari polici which wa pursu in 1993 there would be an increas in the emiss cover of the govern deficit just as there would be for the central bank s credit emiss as a whole the institut of preferenti credit would be introduc anew along with the defer of payment and the write off of the agro industri complex s debt dure the quantit assess of thi version s variabl the ministri proceed on the basi of the fact that the presidenti edict on the republ budget s maximum deficit which can be fund through central bank credit would set the limit for monetari expans in the first quarter at r7 5 trillion increas thi figur would requir go to the duma and a lengthi procedur for discuss of the 1994 budget therefor it is most like that expans of the credit emiss can proce onli through an increas in central bank credit to the economi season work in agricultur shipment to the far north and assist to the fuel and energi complex and the draw of it profit into the budget in addit decis ar be prepar at the present time on the payment of a number of the budget s product debt for 1993 financ basic for the ministri of defens agricultur and grain thi indebted aros as a result of the adopt of numer govern decis which contradict the presidenti edict on a moratorium on increas budget expenditur and the presidenti edict on the rf budget for the fourth quarter of 1993 and which led to an unplan increas in budget expenditur the ministri of financ repeatedli went to the govern with an initi about revok these decis howev not a singl decis ha been revok the payment of the product debt within the limit of the anticip tax revenu in the first quarter and the maximum deficit approv by the presidenti edict is possibl onli through the abolit of the wage index in the budget control sphere thu the inflat mechan will oper in the follow manner the intensif of the central bank s credit emiss in favor of the product sector and the product reorient of budget spend will result in a rapid deterior of the situat in the budget control sphere thi will requir not talk about but actual carri out the index in the second quarter of the budget control worker incom a sharp increas in inflat in the spring will requir a sharp intensif of the financi assist to agricultur the fuel and energi complex and so on a sharp increas in grain price will intensifi the subsidi pressur on the budget it is necessari to add to thi the fact that by the begin of 1994 the domest sourc for increas the currenc suppli in the currenc market had been deplet thi mean that with a mild monetari polici the danger of a synchron or anticipatori increas in the dollar s exchang rate in comparison with inflat becom real as doe the intensif of the flight from the rubl to foreign fund in thi situat the exchang rate pressur on the rate of inflat will increas sharpli the rate of turnov will shoot upward catastroph and monetari control over inflat will be lost in order to pursu the polici of support for product and to maintain balanc on the brink of the surviv of the budget control sphere the credit emiss by at least the middl of the year should amount to 25 30 percent of the gdp thi is a moder realist assess of the action of the red econom manag in 1993 the ukrainian govern carri out an emiss in the amount of half of the gdp thu by 1994 s third quarter russia might realli find itself on the threshold of ukrain of the economi the advers process in the financi sphere will be aggrav by an exodu of capit and a sharp drop in the rubl s exchang rate an altern to thi process will be the reduct of emiss at the end of the third quarter while the current govern will be abl to carri thi out the sharp intensif of the product slump and the reduct in real wage will be a high price to pai for the inconsist displai at the begin of the year an attempt to replac the monetari method of control over inflat with non monetari on price restrict the introduct of the 100 percent sale of currenc earn a currenc

and thi alarm process is increas and so on and so forth the conclus we ar at the point when it is necessari to make a choic between dollar and rubl it is clear that thi mean a choic between an independ econom polici and a puppet on 5 it is clear that the econom method first of all the rais of the interest rate plai a kei role in the struggl against dollar therefor we have demand and will demand from the central bank an increas in the rate in order to make save monei in rubl worthwhil at the same time it is well known that not a singl countri in the world is carri out econom polici us pure econom indirect lever on the other hand the administr basi and the harsh of the penalti for violat the law in ani market economi ar much higher than in russia 6 in principl there exist no absolut comprehens and definit method for combat dollar and also no obligatori preliminari condit for thi struggl in the ussr prior to perestroyka dollar had been extrem limit at least becaus pure administr there wa no us for foreign currenc in bulgaria todai trade for currenc ha been administr ban and the lev s exchang rate is current less than 30 lev to the dollar in our countri it is almost 1 100 although everyon rememb that not long ago the lev and the rubl were 1 1 even a deficit free budget is not an obligatori prerequisit for the start of the struggl against dollar although thi is feasibl as a theoret desir how mani countri current have or had in the past a deficit free budget there simpli ar no such countri anoth matter is the fact that we have pledg to try to fund the deficit exclus through the issu of secur nor is the argument that it is first necessari to introduc 100 percent sell of currenc thi thesi is fals in principl let us take in hand the imf refer book on currenc restrict how mani of the more than 160 countri have such sell current veri few we have alreadi let the moment pass when such a measur wa possibl and now it is caus the addit flight of capit sinc after what happen with the foreign econom activ bank there is no confid onli the rubl s steadfast firm financi and monetari polici and normal interest rate will compel the sell of currenc it is imposs to take awai the right to possess currenc but it is also imposs to toler discrimin against on s own currenc in on s own countri current thi is happen everywher even in moscow in the center of the citi 7 a curiou argument be put forward is the thesi about the fact that combat dollar will requir an increas in the issu of cash monei the liber economist should know that the amount of cash monei in circul in principl is gener of no great import if there is a normal emiss procedur thi mean that the cash monei is acquir purchas by commerci bank from the central bank for non cash monei i e a bui and sell transact is carri out at the same time the cash monei in the central bank s balanc should be counterbalanc by currenc gold and state and other secur it is not the cash emiss which is destruct but rather the credit emiss the distribut of specif credit by our central bank us asset creat out of thin air the banknot polici of the central bank which ha a free hand in thi area is a pure technic matter not associ with profound econom process judg by appear the abil to divin a trend ha emerg in the bank so that thi argument is simpli unten on the other hand a comparison of the market valu of the currenc suppli and the rubl cash suppli show that all our effort at revit the rubl mai prove to be of littl effect if a blow is not struck against the us of foreign currenc within russia and first of all the us of cash which doe not go through the bank avoid control statist and taxat 8 the failur to adopt measur for a decis struggl against dollar is equival to the acknowledg of defeat and the lack of a nation monetari polici measur within the framework of thi struggl should includ without fail a guarante oblig to accept the nation currenc rubl for all type of payment in the countri ani instanc of refus to accept rubl should be classifi as a crime a ban on the accept of foreign cash currenc for payment i e it obligatori exchang for the nation currenc a ban on demand payment in a foreign currenc for ani servic or good includ for foreign a specif exampl at the rubl s present exchang rate we should be a supercheap countri and be earn a great deal from foreign tourism in practic howev we ar earn next to noth and the number of tourist ha decreas even in such citi as st petersburg sinc currenc is be demand for everyth at price higher than european on as a result we have a

first of all from the central bank the servic for currenc and export control custom the tax inspector and the tax investig depart the ministri of intern affair and the ministri of secur the adopt of real and decis measur in thi area if the author is lack it should be grant on would think there would be no opposit to thi from ani part of the polit spectrum the dollar problem directli adjoin the problem of the flight of capit and the conceal of currenc earn and thei should be solv togeth includ by veri harsh measur 10 it is obviou that the failur to adopt harsh measur for the struggl against dollar along with the pursuit of the abov indic monetari polici mai lead to irrevers process when the rubl s stabil will be held back primarili by thi factor even now the monstrou level of dollar is significantli devalu the govern s effort in the monetari and financi area as necessari as air is an administr jolt which would get the financi stabil process move and blow up the sluggish of our econom system thi is why i consid the procrastin in the adopt of specif measur for combat dollar to be intoler sign bg fedorov 6 juli 1993 the these of financ minist bg fedorov s speech at the rf suprem soviet session on 27 august 1993 esteem suprem soviet deputi at todai s meet onli the first point of the presid s tabl of amend is of essenti import thi is the size of the republ budget s deficit if thi amend is vote down then the adopt of all the other will no longer be of ani signific and i want to sai a few word about thi the deficit which you adopt r26 trillion origin the deputi had incorrectli ad up the expenditur for the budget item and were talk about r22 trillion a small error is an almost uniqu phenomenon in world practic as we know it i would like you to ponder it econom and financi consequ over the first 8 month the actual budget deficit take into account the foreign credit amount to around r7 trillion and consequ for the suprem soviet s budget for the 4 subsequ month of the year the deficit increas by almost r20 trillion i e r5 trillion in frivol emiss fund will be pump into the economi monthli consid the fact that further index of the budget is quit like and the fact that there ar still central bank credit for variou need plu benefit we can over these few remain month of the year go to r10 trillion in monthli credit emiss carri out supposedli for the economi s normal develop the experi of all the countri of the world includ our experi of the last 2 year as well clearli show that a financi system which ha thi kind of emiss goe to piec and hyperinfl move from the area of theori into the practic of daili life with well known result hyperinfl mean first of all the impoverish of the peopl even lenin an authorit person for mani in thi hall state correctli that inflat is the worst type of compulsori loan inflat is a tax on each person in the countri and on everi enterpris and the experi of all the countri where there ha been hyperinfl show that the stratif of societi under these condit reach a critic point a group of superrich peopl is form and all the rest becom impoverish the middl class disappear these ar inflat s consequ i will not talk next about invest save and an increas in product which in principl ar imposs in the exist situat in our countri i suggest that you ponder also the experi of ukrain which to a signific degre adopt thi inflationari develop path you know what happen recent with the ukrainian karbovanet and you know how empti the store there ar and what kind of increas in inflat there is in ukrain i do not think that copi thi experi would be good for the russian economi a coupl of word about the intern monetari fund late there have frequent been complaint direct at the govern and the ministri of financ

inflat is still catastroph much and it is simpli ridicul to talk as if we had too harsh a polici or shock therapi onli incompet or dishonest peopl can reason so it is typic that in all sector without except wage in 1993 increas more than inflat did back at the begin of the year we were critic for an underst and unrealist rubl exchang rate but from june through year s end the exchang rate decreas in all from r1 100 to r1 250 to the dollar i e in all by 10 percent while price increas by a factor of approxim 4 our price ar fast approach world price which mean the end of the era of prosper for low effici industri which live through the enorm price explos now mani do not like the strengthen of the rubl although thi is a direct method for combat the export of our nation wealth at a low price the time ha come to ask the mani authorit manag of giant enterpris and the gener of agricultur but what about your labor product and why should we support you when your good ar go for the world price but you ar pai the peopl kopeck i consid it a violat of human right when i am forc to bui an item at a price higher than the world price yet it cannot stand up to critic of ani kind we manag in 1993 over the fierc resist of the central bank and a number of member of the govern to stem the flow of monei subsidi and credit to the ci countri in 1993 despit the resist of the central bank and variou

secret that outright plunder of state asset is go on behind the fine slogan about support on sphere or anoth i do not know who will be at the rudder of russian financi polici in 1994 thi is for the presid and the prime minist to decid but i think that it is necessari to demand from those who lai claim to power absolut specif step and oblig i would consid the minimum program for 1994 to be the follow the peopl s save provid interest rate higher than inflat so that save would actual increas and peopl would be abl to accumul monei for long term purchas until thi is done there will be no invest and industri upsw at the same time it is necessari to pai reason compens for save for the loss from the liber in januari of 1992 but through non inflationari sourc the public s real incom should increas by at least 20 30 percent and the dollar equival of the averag monthli wage should increas from 100 to 250 it is necessari to introduc tax regul which reduc the dispar in incom between the richest peopl and the poorest peopl inflat should in the veri near futur be reduc to less than 5 percent per month which is equival to 80 percent per year thi will mean an opportun to reduc the interest rate overal level to stimul invest and for enterpris to plan their own activ to the extent that the budget deficit is reduc to 5 percent or less of the gdp and it is fund through market borrow it will be possibl to reduc the tax burden on commod produc the rubl s currenc exchang rate given a favor turn of event will not fall in 1994 below r2 000 2 500 to the dollar which will make our export more signific facilit import and forc enterpris to think about competit product and qualiti at the same time all the remain restrict on export should be remov complet these ar the most basic requir for the financi polici in 1994 will we have enough courag to accept these oblig and to answer then to the peopl i have carefulli studi the opposit s demand and program and have come to

the dollar of the economi will intensifi anew some price will be fix and an attempt will be made to confisc monei especi currenc in bank a shortag of mani type of good will emerg again store will

will be a similar market in kiev and trade there possibl will be russian chase after karbovants i do not exclud the possibl that our miner will travel to kazakhstan to earn a live current there ar ukrainian travel to rostov for half wage it mai be that our deleg will travel to tashkent to request credit while russian enterpris will be try to keep monei in zaychik in belorussian belarusian bank the onli possibl consol for our adversari is a product increas of 3 5 percent through an increas in the product of tank and missil in truth i do not think that thi will bring much joi to russia s
