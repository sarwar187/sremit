forc peopl to undergo treatment i do not know of ani countri in the world that ha reach that extrem i return to the same point i think the rule must allow congress to pass a law govern all these aspect i would also sai that the countri that have taken these step as i said befor did so after a broad discuss and base on a polit decis made by congress or the citizen i think that if thi option were to be pursu it would have to be discuss by congress or made by decis of the citizen in a popular consult i would even understand if the court state that thi cannot be consid an offens or violat but congress author to make decis of thi type in a govern law must be preserv if that is not possibl i hope the court s rule will allow congress to establish restrict on all i have said i would go even further i think thi possibl must be examin in case it is decid that the state will be unabl to establish those restrict we would then have to think about amend the constitut to place limit on the right of autonomi and the develop of person we could even ask citizen in the near futur if thei agre with a chang of thi natur in the constitut by wai of a referendum as time goe by i hope to sai more about thi issu i realli hope the constitution court will clearli establish that no abus will be commit and that limit will be establish within thi decis with which the govern doe not agre as i said befor i as head of the govern will abid by thi rule as we ar mandat to abid by the constitution court s rule i believ howev that the promulg of thi law as the develop of individu person could have seriou and danger implic for colombian societi word indistinct i hope the court s rule at least allow congress through a govern law to place a seri of limit on that decis by the court otherwis there mai be veri grave implic for thi societi report mr presid will the govern take immedi action to overcom thi impass take advantag of the state of intern disturb gaviria no no no we ar not go to resort to the state of intern disturb to respond to a constitution court rule we ar forc to wait for the constitution court s rule to analyz it scope and implic onli then will we decid what to do regard limit on said decis we hope we can resort to congress to establish someth that the constitut and the veri court rule have establish that is that the law have reason limit we ar live in a state of law so it must be possibl i cannot imagin the court grant the absolut right to consum drug in colombia thi could also lead to unreason situat if no limit ar set it is possibl that suicid and even abort could be legal no person develop ha clear limit in colombia and all civil societi there ar limit the court ha declar legal mayor decre establish limit on alcohol consumpt so i cannot understand how the court deem it reason to establish limit on alcohol consumpt but not on drug consumpt i go back to anoth absurd point which i hope the constitut court rule will clarifi thi mai mean that medic prescript for drug consumpt cannot be written becaus thei limit the develop of person and peopl have the right to consum ani drug with ani number of effect thi is incorrect and i hope the court clearli establish the capac and right of societi to set limit in thi instanc report mr presid could the court rule at some point support the prosecutor gener s propos to legal drug and word indistinct intern level gaviria i cannot answer that question you would have to ask the prosecutor gener directli you would have to ask him if the elimin of sanction on drug us is part of hi propos or if he believ the legal issu must be studi further onli the prosecutor gener can answer those question report the us govern protest colombia s decis on the media is there ani offici statement on that yet gaviria no i think it is irrelev it is a domest matter i wa not talk about intern consequ and i am not go to i think we must discuss thi here and now as a domest issu as a colombian issu again i sincer appeal to the sensibl and matur of the constitution court and hope it doe not make thi an absolut right if thei do it could lead us to truli absurd and danger situat i hope we do not go so far as to call thi an absolut right of an individu in the develop of hi or her person that allow no limit report mr presid the countri s coffe grower have ask the govern to studi coffe price on the local

will the former guerrilla live how will thei earn a live and what will be done with their properti samper add alreadi mani guerrilla ar involv in organ crime samper then stress the need to support peac through the busi sector note that as develop minist he arrang some veri interest meet with businessmen with thi goal in mind in repli to anoth question samper sai guerrilla should be guarante minimum subsist he continu by sai everyth els is negoti ad that the govern is the on to set condit and that the negoti must be brief he add that it is necessari to draw out the bottom line condit requir by both the govern and the guerrilla befor the two side sit down to negoti on the topic of when the peac process should begin samper sai no deadlin should be set but the process should begin the dai after the presid is chosen and i hope it is me on 30 mai the topic then shift to kidnap which on report describ as intim link to subvers and he ask samper how hi govern intend to deal with thi problem samper repli that he ha support the work of the free countri foundat ad we need more legal regulatori guidelin he continu we must have secur organ that must be commit to rel of kidnap victim in order to rescu the victim and return them to safeti on the subject of the two basic guerrilla propos 1 land reform and greater assist for peasant as demand by the revolutionari arm forc of colombia and 2 a nationalist oil polici as demand by the armi of nation liber samper is ask to what degre would your govern be will to give in samper sai the problem with agrarian reform is that everyth ha been left half done about 1 million hectar still need to be distribut he add that colombia ha long stand oil legisl ad i do not think it is a good idea to chang the rule of the game for oil investor overnight adjust can be made as ha recent been the case so that the amount of royalti ar not onli proportion to the size of the well but in accord with the well s product therefor a higher produc well will earn more monei for the govern nevertheless in no case whatsoev would i establish law that disregard the right of investor in term of land reform samper sai the law also outlin certain wai to capit the agricultur and cattl rais sector there ar mani aspect of agrarian reform that specif deal with land issu therefor there is no reason for me to disagre with you that we of cours need to return the agrarian save bank to the peasant and to give all worker in the farm sector new and improv live condit return to the subject of dialogu with the guerrilla samper sai he would entrust the work to a high commission who would have the specif task of establish all contact not onli with the guerrilla but also with civilian societi to creat an atmospher of peac ask whether peac is hi top prioriti samper repli peac must come hand in hand with secur for the common man on the street asid from not be mug peac mai veri well mean also have job opportun he add thi peac must also be achiev within an overal secur process which mean improv the secur condit under which mani colombian now live the subject then turn to the recent constitut court decis to decrimin the so call person dose of drug and samper is ask whether he agre with the govern s posit of wait for the full text of the rule to be publish next week befor announc it final posit samper sai ye but we must also understand that the debat is not just a legal on but also a polit and social debat becaus the simpl decrimin announc for person dose of drug could begin turn countless sinist wheel in the drug underworld which would encourag the sell of drug for person us to youth at rock bottom price liber parti presidenti candid ernesto samper continu by sai he ha chang hi view on the legal of drug becaus when i propos legal drug 15 year ago the drug busi onli involv a few peasant who grew marijuana in santa marta s sierra neveda at the time i said let us bui out their drug product let us give them the abil to chang their crop and thi will allow us to get out from under the power of drug no on took ani notic and we then went from marijuana to coca from coca to cocain and then came drug traffick and from drug traffick we went to narcoterror obvious condit todai make legal total unviabl it is not that i have chang my posit instead the circumst have chang over the past 15 year and thi is why right now i have spoken out against decrimin becaus peopl might get the idea that thi is some sort of pardon for everyth that ha taken place over the past 15 year there ar howev veri respect peopl who continu to work on the legal idea for exampl dr alvaro gomez hurtado who current support dr andr pastrana gomez ha not been heard recent on ani of these topic it would be good to know whether he share the opinion of dr pastrana on thi point or whether he insist on hi legal idea samper is ask whether the govern should negoti with the remain drug cartel as well as how should these drug traffick be confront samper sai he is a fanat believ that drug traffick should be prosecut under the law if the prison term have to be review fine if term reduct mechan need to be separ to prevent the two mechan from run in parallel then thi should be done i fulli agre that an immedi review should be institut we cannot deni colombian the right that those who break the law receiv a fair trial and a safe jail to serv their time thi is basic what the surrend polici is all about i will therefor continu to support thi polici becaus i believ we cannot wait for the unit state to reduc consumpt or wait for germani to halt the traffick of chemic precursor to resolv the drug problem the discuss then turn to colombian coffe polici and samper is ask if he were presidet now what instruct he would give to financ and public credit minist rudolf homm regard a hike in coffe price samper repli the current domest price for a pound of coffe is approxim 85 cent while intern price have alreadi reach 1 25 therefor a 5 percent increas would onli translat to four cent which seem veri low to me i believ we need to go much higher i do not want to mention a figur to avoid be call a populist samper add even if dr pastrana doe not like it coffe grower have a right to receiv a good portion of the price fetch on the intern market the rest can be set asid for a stabil fund to cover sluggish period it seem to be complet senseless to argu that coffe price should be frozen to control inflat coffe grower like ani other sector of the economi have the right to benefit from market open that is why i maintain as part of my coffe doctrin that we need to free coffe from state macroeconom supervis why should the govern reach into the pocket of coffe grower each time it need to reduc inflat no if the economi is to be open then it should be open for everyon after arizmendi urg samper to give specif exampl concern hi coffe polici samper repli he would propos two hike in coffe price on right awai between 10 15 percent and i would leav an adjust that thei will like seek from me in septemb pend samper add i prefer to increas coffe price rather than to adopt pastrana s propos to forgiv the debt forgiv the coffe produc debt seem to me extrem danger if we begin pardon debt as dr pastrana propos can you imagin the financi system s collaps

most of the should we sai limit that could be establish could be done by decre to avert the constitut consequ howev and to try to avoid have thi type of interpret of the constitut prevail we have to modifi the constitut we believ the law that will be propos to congress on hold a referendum should come from a popular initi and we hope in the come dai to form a group to follow all procedur regard the law on mechan for particip that will be sanction next week we ar onli wait for the signatur of some congression chamber presid becaus as the constitut court stipul congress establish the requir that a popular initi law must call a referendum i would also like to point out that base on our consult our interpret of the constitut and the law on mechan for particip our opinion is that thi referendum cannot take place concurr with an elect it could not be held either dure the first elect the runoff elect or possibl in the upcom octob elect that referendum would have to be held on a separ date we have not set a date for referendum nor have we agre on it content becaus we want to reach a consensu with the sector that come with us to collect the signatur we want to get back on cours and present thi to the congress dure it regular session in june or in the session that ar to start on 20 juli we believ it would not be appropri to present it befor the law on mechan for particip is pass or befor hear the view of the other sector on which we have call we will begin consult next week in order to form a group of peopl to negoti a popular inti law with the congress i am posit we will be abl to gather the 800 000 signatur requir to make thi a popular initi law i have confid we will collect sever million signatur for congress so that it becom awar of what colombian want moder here is william parra parra mr presid why had we not heard until now about the govern s reaction to thi constitut court decis why did the govern not respond while the suit wa pend what justif can presid gaviria give colombian when he strongli promot the constitut and now he want to reform it as the constitut court presid said yesterdai it s like have a new dress and chang it word indistinct three month later gaviria first i believ you did not listen to the statement i made the dai after the court s decis i believ colombian ar clear on the fact that their govern and their presid react to the court s decis i do not believ my statement todai is ani differ from the on i made at that time two minut break in recept that our constitut embrac fundament right which have no limit and must not be compar to these other right somehow thi is what is behind the constitut court s decis word indistinct becaus obvious that wa not the feel of the four magistr who cast a dissent vote thu respond to the argument and motiv with which the major of constitut court magistr reach thi decis moder the next question is from ricaro canon from the noon newscast after that will be jairo gomez canon mr presid as long as thi decis is in effect what posit and action will the govern adopt to repress and penal drug consumpt and traffick do you consid as you point out that the constitut court s decis can be overturn by decre gaviria no no we cannot overturn the court s rule by issu a decre becaus it will violat the constitut becaus the rule ha a paragraph that includ the same guidelin decre and law of previou polic corp we will establish some of the limit that the court believ ar reason and could be establish the essenc of the rule howev drug consumpt in colombia will not be ban thi is a basic right that cannot be curtail by issu a decre the onli wai we can curtail that right should we want to is to amend our constitut by mean of follow the amend procedur stipul in the constitut itself moder next question is by jairo gomez from the seven o clock newscast follow by antonio jose caballero gomez mr presid accord to the propos you have just made there will undoubtedli be a need for mani step and most sure it will not be taken into account befor your administr end on 7 august why did you not leav thi to the new presid of the republ gaviria well for on thing the new presid of the republ would have proceed with thi issu as he saw fit i do not want to get involv in the decis the new presid would adopt i am go to issu the decre and take the initi in ask citizen to express their opinion i believ that it wa not onli the presid s opinion which i express in the earli hour of the dai after the court s decis in thi respect with regard to the next govern he will proce as he deem appropi i believ that as a result of the colombian peopl s gener frame of mind with respect to thi issu the next presid s govern will work to have the peopl express an opinion on thi issu if we had had a presid elect now i could have consult him about the issu sinc we do not i believ it is my respons to uphold the colombian peopl s desir to keep work to prevent thi situat which is of a legal natur from take hold thi is the case not onli becaus of what it repres as far as drug consumpt goe which a great major of colombian reject but also for other reason that could becom a realiti if thi type of decis prevail in colombian societi as an interpret of the constitut moder here is antonio jose caballero of rcn and clement dominguez get readi to ask hi question caballero mr presid onc again we hear the express i abid by but do not agre with in thi explan of the colombian state branch the prosecutor gener word indistinct through the constitut court what is the govern most concern about the imag of colombian abroad or the health and well be of peopl here gaviria with regard to what the prosecutor gener think of the constitut court s decis that is someth you would have to ask him whether thi wa the sort of legal he wa propos or someth differ or whether he had anoth propos to make to colombia and the intern commun i would prefer not to interpret the prosecutor gener s view i have clearli state that i am concern about thi situat s impact at home not for it impact abroad i am fundament concern about it impact at home on the health of colombian the social cohes of colombian the need to punish the antisoci behavior in colombian societi it concern me whether it is advis for colombian societi to be abl to demand that drug abus undergo medic treatment so that colombian societi can punish anyon who is a repeat drug abus if he doe not undergo medic treatment and give up drug these circumst make thi a seriou matter reaction abroad doe not seem essenti to me citizen reaction parent and young peopl reflect concern for our children our young peopl and our societi i have not seen anyon worri about the consequ abroad in fact i do not think there will be consequ abroad we have to focu on the impact thi ha on our famili our children and our societi moder here to ask a question is clement dominguez of todelar samuel salazar of caracol radio get readi to ask hi question dominguez mr presid why do you insist on a referendum rather than on a bill as the constitut court said and why not includ the propos for an educ campaign for drug abus sinc expert feel drug addict is a kind of ill gaviria regard the first issu i would like to sai the decre we will issu will in no wai take the place of a statutori law that establish limit mention by the court s decis the court said these ar polic norm and we believ that by gather a larg amount of norm from the minor code and other kind of legisl to which we will refer next when we issu the decre we will be abl to establish those limit but we ar concern about the motiv behind the sentenc not so much about the decis that we can crimin drug consumpt sinc what concern me the most is motiv why ar we concern about motiv and why do i insist on thi we ar concern about motiv becaus it ha turn drug consumpt not into antisoci behavior that will not be penal but into a civil right these ar two veri differ thing it is true that some societi have come to the conclus that thei do not want to penal drug consumpt or person drug dose no societi howev ha said that drug consumpt is not antisoci conduct thi is someth exclus to colombian societi and our constitut court holland germani itali spain and some us state did not do thi that is not true drug consumpt in all those countri is antisoci conduct it is antisoci conduct in some countri it is punish by law and in other it is not but in all of them it is antisoci behavior but here our court in an interpr that we describ as excess individualist ha rule that drug consumpt is not antisoci behavior but actual a right i think it doe seriou harm to colombian societi to coexist with that theori with that underli idea of the develop of person which deep down paus in some wai we agre with the dissent opinion that show thi undermin life and the veri argument us by the court it undermin human digniti the develop of person and social coexist moder here to ask a question is samuel salazar of caracol radio and pablo arturo paez get readi salazar word indistinct ninenteen second break in recept for station identif by station announc gaviria an arbitrari arrest we could decid to arrest a driver for have taken drug we believ thi conduct is evid damag to societi in addit we would have to consid other than simpl penalti we believ such conduct warrant an arrest and our constitut forese it word indistinct not been declar as invalid by the court we believ that anyon who take drug in public place can be subject to arrest more so if we ar refer to ani public forc member quit frankli i plan to fight with all my energi to prevent colombian societi from fall prei to situat where for exampl public forc member or even doctor take drug right in front of their patient or perform surgeri while under the influenc of drug i firmli believ that such conduct warrant an arrest don t you agre moder the follow question is from carlo arturo paez from word indistinct follow by ana fernanda valderrama paez mr presid the constitut court s major decis wa made by take articl 16 of the constitut into consider when read thi articl we notic that thi articl is veri broad and difficult to regul doe the govern have it own initi as to what and how thi articl should be regul gaviria most sure it is an articl veri difficult to regul except for case involv drug consumpt we have found no other angl to develop the articl as part of a statutori law we have thought and thi would be on of the issu we would propos to the group work on the peopl s initi law to includ a propos to add sever paragraph to the articl establish that the lawmak can determin penalti inclus of crimin penalti not onli against those who take drug under certain circumst such as the on i just mention most of all to determin penalti even for those who take drug on a person basi moder last question from ana fernanda valderrama from nation newscast valderrama mr presid good afternoon through a decre you plan to tell the colombian peopl as well as the countri s mayor that thei ar not allow to take drug in public place you plan to tell doctor that thei cannot do it in front of their patient what everyon is wonder howev is that most sure the peopl ar go to do it in privat and it is not go to be restrict to the averag citizen but it will also spread even govern worker do you not believ that thi could foment the doubl moral standard alreadi exist in the countri gaviria of cours howev that is not as result of the decre the govern is go to issu it is a repercuss of the rule by the constitut court i think we all agre and i think that on thi the constitut court also agre that colombian have the right to consum drug but that there must be limit which limit there ar limit on situat that endang social coexist solidar and social order those limit will undoubtedli have to be establish anywai just imagin a societi that condon situat such as a pilot fly an aircraft or a driver under the influenc of drug situat such as those repres a peril to social order i feel oblig regardless of the inconsist you just mention to issu a decre that includ those legal provis thank you all

for variou reason first the govern believ thi will encourag an increas in drug consumpt in colombia thu serious undermin the tranquil of the peopl and famili develop it could also significantli increas crime and violenc the govern doe not believ that thi issu should becom an aspect of the develop of the person of the individu carri that view to an extrem mai have exceedingli undesir effect so i hope the court will explain thi in the rule to be announc to colombian in a few dai the constitut court must clarifi a number of aspect so congress can at least regul them in a statutori law thi must not turn into an absolut right becaus that would lead us to absurd decis the court must make it clear that the us of narcot by minor and adolesc must be limit or ban at the veri least also the congress or the court should be abl to avoid or limit consumpt in school and univers i would also sai that the court should make it clear paus it should at least give congress the option of ban drug consumpt in public place if possibl it must also ban drug consumpt by women who ar pregnant or nurs the free develop of person ought not lead to babi with birth defect caus by drug consumpt we must not sai that we cannot control such thing on account of the principl of develop of the person that would lead to absurd situat it must also be clear that driver or pilot cannot take drug no on could live in thi societi if that were allow on the ground that it is person develop as presid i would sai that free develop of the person cannot mean that colombia is unabl to campaign against drug abus becaus that would hamper the develop of the person we would becom a societi that regard drug consumpt as desir and advis we mai almost have to encourag it someth that greatli disturb the govern the govern ha taken other consider into account true some us state and european countri have legal drug consumpt those decis howev have had controversi result i understand that consumpt ha increas in the countri where drug have been legal asid from that the legislatur have made those decis follow a veri broad public debat i do not know if countri or state allow the person us of hard drug like cocain i do not have that inform i have not heard of that becaus the extrem high level of addict make us quickli realiz that it is not a matter of person develop but of a simpl addict or ill if we turn thi into a person develop issu that mean we cannot forc peopl to undergo treatment i do not know of ani countri in the world that ha reach that extrem i return to the same point i think the rule must allow congress to pass a law govern all these aspect i would also sai that the countri that have taken these step as i said befor did so after a broad discuss and base on a polit decis made by congress or the citizen i think that if thi option were to be pursu it would have to be discuss by congress or made by decis of the citizen in a popular consult i would even understand if the court state that thi cannot be consid an offens or violat but congress author to make decis of thi type in a govern law must be preserv if that is not possibl i hope the court s rule will allow congress to establish restrict on all i have said i would go even further i think thi possibl must be examin in case it is decid that the state will be unabl to establish those restrict we would then have to think about amend the constitut to place limit on the right of autonomi and the develop of person we could even ask citizen in the near futur if thei agre with a chang of thi natur in the constitut by wai of a referendum as time goe by i hope to sai more about thi issu i realli hope the constitution court will clearli establish that no abus will be commit and that limit will be establish within thi

disturb gaviria no no no we ar not go to resort to the state of intern disturb to respond to a constitution court rule we ar forc to wait for the constitution court s rule to analyz it scope and implic onli then will we decid what to do regard limit on said decis we hope we can resort to congress to establish someth that the constitut and the veri court rule have establish that is that the law have reason limit we ar live in a state of law so it must be possibl i cannot imagin the court grant the absolut right to consum drug in colombia thi could also lead to unreason situat if no limit ar set it is possibl that suicid and even abort could be legal no person develop ha clear limit in colombia and all civil societi there ar limit the court ha declar legal mayor decre establish limit on alcohol consumpt so i cannot understand how the court deem it reason to establish limit on alcohol consumpt but not on drug consumpt i go back to anoth absurd point which i hope the constitut court rule will clarifi thi mai mean that medic prescript for drug consumpt cannot be written becaus thei limit the develop of person and peopl have the right to consum ani drug with ani number of effect thi is incorrect and i hope the court clearli establish the capac and right of societi to set limit in thi instanc report mr presid could the court rule at some point support the prosecutor gener s

politician could better us the monei for prevent and treatment denmark will not be abl to avoid corrupt at the top if european drug polici continu as it ha up until now give more monei to the polic is just put a band aid on a diseas that need to be cure at it root through prevent and treatment befor the european democraci ultim succumb to drug crime thi is the opinion of gener secretari kendal whose unconvent opinion have set mani to think he ha perhap even succeed howev slightli in help to chang the lawmak concept of the drug problem in ani case the debat can be heard all over the western world the danish govern s recent propos drug initi is onli on of mani european measur the connect between the drug trade and organ crime mean that todai the two type of crimin activ cannot be easili separ from on anoth drug profit have risen so steepli that corrupt in itself is a signific concern we can see it in industri countri such as itali and in southern franc i am certain that even in denmark and great britain opportun for corrupt highli place offici present themselv more frequent than ever befor when i sai thi it is in order to make the politician understand how seriou the problem is thei ar confront it is not just a question of the rise in drug abus which is seriou enough but also the danger organ crime pose to our societi the drug trade is an attack on our democraci and economi said kendal passag omit shortsight more than 60 percent of all crime is connect with the drug trade thi increas ha occur dure the last 20 year in 1974 europ did not have a real drug problem although there wa natur a small number of drug addict in everi countri great britain had for exampl about 150 confirm drug addict at that time the biggest problem in europ wa the french connect the group in southern franc that produc design drug primarili for drug user in the unit state but a mere 20 year later the situat ha reach a point where a critic drug situat is found not onli in the capit but in all the larger european citi thi ha happen becaus in the begin we believ the problem belong to other we focus our energi on pressur the countri who produc the drug offer them assist in elimin drug manufactur etc next we expend our resourc on build up our own effect narcot polic forc at no time did we serious attempt to reduc the demand for drug in our own countri as a result consumpt rose drastic becaus drug were not seen as a seriou problem product and demand soar kendal blame european politician for thi even though some politician have been inclin in recent year to acknowledg the danger sign effort to tackl the drug question have not been adequ politician first adopt a stanc on an issu when the problem ha alreadi reach alarm proport and then it is often too late eventu thei comprehend the serious of the problem and thei discov that their expect of beat the problem at home by stop product in other countri ar not realist the problem cannot be dispos of in thi wai it simpli crop up in a new place as mai be appreci by the fact that a number of the former soviet state such as kazakhstan and tajikistan have now becom center of drug product unfortun it take a long time befor social assist program show result and therefor thei cost a lot of monei thu the tendenc ha alwai been to give more monei to the polic thi mean that we arrest more peopl and seiz more drug result like these count more in the ey of politician whose perspect on the futur stretch onli three to five year into the futur until the next elect in the current econom crisi politician do not like to spend larg sum of monei on prevent measur that will not yield result for mani year wherea anyth that will yield result befor the next elect is ok howev thei ar not tackl the real problem increas polic strength doe not reduc the demand for drug as long as we do noth about demand none of our other effort will have ani effect we ar go to have to recogn just how enorm the problem realli is it ha reach proport where 50 to 60 percent of our budget goe to secur measur and other item that directli or indirectli relat to drug toward liber the grow disposit for a more prevent approach is thwart in part kendal feel by the debat over the liber of drug polici he ha recent been quot in denmark by justic minist erl olsen as favor an overal decrimin of drug but thi is due to a poor translat of a french interview by the english speak press he explain to thi interview what i said wa that decrimin of drug should be consid with the consum in mind there is no point in the polic arrest peopl who have drug intend for person us in their possess it is quit anoth matter in the case of dealer on whom we must come down hard what purpos is there in ensnar an addict in the justic system and send him to jail where he risk fall in with an even more crimin element when our resourc do not even permit us to investig everi singl case even so it should be prohibit to sell drug onli in creat barrier to the us of drug do we have a hope of induc peopl to go into prevent treatment program thei will hardli do so voluntarili deepli depend addict whatev their desir to throw off their addict ar not capabl of take the initi themselv thei must be forc into it therefor the leverag to send them to a treatment facil onc thei violat the law ha to be retain thi requir that treatment facil be built and treatment program set up the problem todai is that these facil do not exist prevent approach have been left to the privat humanitarian organ volunt assist group and other nongovernment agenc who have been alloc some minor econom fund that cannot be call a seriou effort on behalf of interpol i speak out against the liber of drug we must act pragmat and realist it is not realist to believ the drug problem can be solv through liber in the first place it would be veri difficult to do which drug should be decrimin what quantiti should be permit to individu how should thei be distribut and what ag limit should there be if drug were decrimin there would be even more wai to becom addict and the problem would end up bigger than it alreadi is passag omit kendal ad that it is meaningless to make a distinct between hard and soft drug or to argu that hashish at least should be decrimin he call thi type of argument a smoke screen inasmuch as all drug ar harm societi he insist would creat still more problem for itself if hash were made legal furthermor it is an oversimplif of the issu to maintain that drug crime can be elimin simpli by decrimin drug twenti year ago the tradit organ crimin group were mafia who made their monei in prostitut casino weapon and so forth so even in a futur in which there were no drug the organ crimin group would continu to make monei in on wai or anoth mayb thei would make less but thei would make someth in the last 20 year howev organ crime ha chang it financi method becom involv in the drug trade ha also made it easier for crimin leader to engag in corrupt at

exampl rob a bank kendal return to prevent campaign as a solut to a substanti part of the drug problem if it is possibl through inform campaign to persuad the new gener to stai awai from both hard and soft drug it will affect the whole drug network advers with econom consequ for ringlead and middlemen politician new awar can be attribut on the on hand to the link between aid and needl user and on the other hand to the ill effect the problem ha brought with it first of all it impact our econom situat but more critic mani jobless young peopl find it harder and harder to find ani mean in their

stimul is on the rise yet with the proper prevent program it is possibl to see result in the futur compar it with smoke which ha fallen dramat on the basi of antismok campaign or with the drop in the

rid of drug abus we can mere reduc the extent of it without wish to singl out ani particular countri for it drug polici kendal is nevertheless impress with sweden which us more resourc per capita on prevent and treatment than ani other countri in the world the unit state is next while the european nation in gener do not reap much prais from the gener secretari both becaus thei put too littl monei into the problem and becaus too mani place ar mindlessli us methadon as a treatment without attempt to lower consumpt when peopl talk about methadon treatment as a solut to the problem of drug addict thei ar get thing mix up in my opinion the onli peopl who have the right and the knowledg to express themselv on method of treatment ar doctor and addict whether methadon should or should not be us in treatment is not within my expertis nor should it be a matter of polit content the fact that switzerland is now experi with control dispens of heroin is in my opinion a courag attempt i believ thi type of solut need to be tri of cours on could sai that dispens drug by prescript is a type of liber but i do not agre with that on should bear in mind that it is against the law to take drug howev in the begin in order to solv the big problem it is necessari to introduc an interim type of liber but it must not be legal so that you and i begin to take the stuff despit the measur that ar slowli take

charact we have determin that most of the should we sai limit that could be establish could be done by decre howev to avert the constitut consequ and to try to avoid have thi type of interpret of the constitut prevail we have to modifi the constitut we believ the law that will be propos to congress on hold a referendum should come from a popular initi and we hope in the come dai to form a group to follow all procedur regard the law on mechan for particip that will be sanction next week we ar onli wait for the signatur of some congression chamber presid becaus as the constitut court stipul congress establish the requir that a popular initi law lei de iniciativa popular must call a referendum i would also like to point out that base on our consult our interpret of the constitut and the law on mechan for particip our opinion is that thi referendum cannot take place concurr with an elect it could not be held either dure the first elect the runoff elect or possibl in the upcom octob elect that referendum would have to be held on a separ date we have not set a date for referendum nor have we agre on it content becaus we want to reach a consensu with the sector that come with us to collect the signatur we want to get back on cours and present thi to the congress dure it regular session in june or in the session that ar to start on 20 juli we believ it would not be appropri to

that it becom awar of what colombian want moder here is william parra parra mr presid why hadn t we heard until now about the govern s reaction to thi constitut court decis why didn t the govern respond while the suit wa pend what justif can presid gaviria give colombian when he strongli promot the constitut and now he want to reform it as the constitut court presid said yesterdai it s like have a new dress and chang it word indistinct three month later gaviria first i believ you did not listen to the statement i made the dai after the court s decis i believ colombian ar clear on the fact that their govern and their presid react to the court s decis i do not believ my statement todai is ani differ from the on i made at that time two minut break in recept that our constitut embrac fundament right which have no limit and must not be compar to these other right thi is somehow what is behind the constitut court s decis word indistinct becaus obvious that wa not the feel of the four magistr who cast a dissent vote thu respond to the argument and motiv with which the major of constitut court magistr reach thi decis moder the next question is from ricaro canon from the noon newscast after that will be jairo gomez canon mr presid as long as thi decis is in effect what posit and action will the govern adopt to repress and penal drug consumpt and traffick do you consid as you point out that the constitut court s decis can be overturn by decre gaviria no no we cannot overturn the court s rule by issu a decre becaus it will violat the constitut becaus the rule ha a paragraph that includ the same guidelin decre and law of previou polic corp we will establish some of the limit that the court believ ar reason and could be establish howev the essenc of the rule drug consumpt in colombia will not be ban thi is a basic right that cannot be curtail by issu a decre the onli wai we can curtail that right should we want to is to amend our constitut by mean of follow the amend procedur stipul in the constitut itself moder next question is by jairo gomez from the seven o clock newscast follow by antonio jose caballero gomez mr presid accord to the propos you have just made there will undoubtedli be need for mani step and most sure it will not be taken into account befor your administr end on 7 august why did you not leav thi to the new presid of the republ gaviria well for on thing the new presid of the republ would have proceed with thi issu as he saw fit i do not want to get involv in the decis the new presid would adopt i am go to issu the decre and take the initi in ask citizen to express their opinion i believ that it wa not onli the presid s opinion which i express in the earli hour of the dai after the court s decis in thi respect with regard to the next govern he will proce as he deem appropi i believ that as a result of the gener frame of mind of the colombian peopl with respect to thi issu the next presid s govern will work to have the peopl express an opinion on thi issu if we had had a presid elect now i could have consult on the issu with him sinc we don t i believ it is my respons to uphold the colombian peopl s desir to keep work to prevent thi situat which is of a legal natur from take hold thi is the case not onli becaus of what it repres as far as drug consumpt goe which a great major of colombian reject but also for other reason that could becom a realiti if thi type of decis prevail in colombian societi as an interpret of the constitut moder here is antonio jose caballero of rcn and clement dominguez get readi to ask hi question caballero mr presid onc again we hear the express i abid by but do not agre with in thi explan of the colombian state branch the prosecutor gener word indistinct through the constitut court what is the govern most concern about the imag of colombian abroad or the health and well be of peopl here gaviria with regard to what the prosecutor gener think of the constitut court s decis that is someth you would have to ask him whether thi wa the sort of legal he wa propos or someth differ or whether he had anoth propos to make to colombia and the intern commun i would prefer not to interpret the prosecutor gener s view i have clearli state that i am concern about thi situat s impact at home not for it impact abroad i am fundament concern about it impact at home on the health of colombian the social cohes of colombian the need to punish the antisoci behavior in colombian societi it concern me whether it is advis for colombian societi to be abl to demand that drug abus undergo medic treatment so that colombian societi can punish anyon who is a repeat drug abus if he doe not undergo medic treatment and give up drug these circumst make thi a seriou matter reaction abroad doe not seem essenti to me reaction of citizen parent and young peopl reflect concern for our children our young peopl and our societi i have not seen anyon worri about the consequ abroad in fact i do not think there will be consequ abroad we have to focu on the impact thi ha on our famili our children and our societi moder here to ask a question is clement dominguez of todelar samuel salazar of caracol radio get readi to ask hi question dominguez mr presid why do you insist on a referendum rather than on a bill as the constitut court said and why not includ the propos for an educ campaign for drug abus sinc expert feel drug addict is a kind of ill gaviria regard the first issu i would like to sai the decre we will issu will in no wai take the place of a statutori law that establish limit mention by the court s decis the court said these ar polic norm and we believ that by gather a larg amount of norm from the minor code and other kind of legisl to which we will refer next when we will issu the decre we will be abl to establish those limit but we ar concern about the motiv behind the sentenc not so much about the decis that we can crimin as heard drug consumpt sinc what concern me the most is motiv why ar we concern about motiv and why do i insist on thi we ar concern about motiv becaus it ha turn drug consumpt not into antisoci behavior that will not be penal but into a civil right these ar two veri differ thing it is true that some societi have come to the conclus that thei do not want to penal drug consumpt or the person drug dose no societi howev ha said that drug consumpt is not antisoci conduct thi is someth exclus to colombian societi and our constitut court holland germani itali spain and some us state did not do thi that is not true drug consumpt in all those countri is antisoci conduct it is antisoci conduct in some countri it is punish by law and in other it is not but in all of them it is antisoci behavior but here our court in an interpr that we describ as excess individualist ha rule that drug consumpt is not antisoci behavior but actual a right i think it doe seriou harm to colombian societi to coexist with that theori with that underli idea of the develop of person which deep down paus in some wai we agre with the dissent opinion that show thi undermin life and the veri argument us by the court it undermin human digniti the develop of person and social coexist moder here to ask a question is samuel salazar of caracol radio and pablo arturo paez get readi salazar word indistinct ninenteen second break in

in public place can be subject to arrest more so if we ar refer to ani public forc member quit frankli speak i plan to fight with all my energi to prevent colombian societi from fall prei to situat where for exampl public forc member or even doctor take drug right in front of their patient or perform surgeri while under the influenc of drug i firmli believ that such conduct warrant an arrest don

to the averag citizen but it will also spread even govern worker don t you believ that thi could foment the doubl moral standard alreadi exist in the countri gaviria of cours howev that is not as result of the decre the govern is go to issu it is a repercuss of the rule by the constitut court i think we all agre and i think that on thi the constitut court also agre that colombian have the right to consum drug but that there must be limit which limit there ar limit on situat that endang social coexist solidar and social order those limit will undoubtedli have to be establish anywai just
