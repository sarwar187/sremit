realiti by the extent of their countri econom depend on the soviet union and by their knowledg that the polit surviv of the region s on parti system ultim still depend on moscow what then can be made of gorbachev s more paternalist approach to eastern europ clearli soviet hegemoni is not give wai to full respect for the principl of sovereignti and noninterfer there ar circumst that would prompt moscow to resort to the us of forc on behalf of it geopolit if not ideolog interest claim that the warsaw pact s common interest were threaten inde the import question is not whether the brezhnev doctrin is aliv or dead even if it were declar null and void east european would remain uncertain and skeptic the more realist question ar these to what extent ha the threshold of soviet toler chang how far can an east european countri go without invit soviet militari intervent on answer is that as long as a given east european countri remain in the warsaw pact and accept social there will be no intervent a second answer is that the soviet threshold of toler is higher for the region s small and strateg insignific countri bulgaria romania and hungari than it is for east germani poland and czechoslovakia the third and safest answer is that onli if an upheav occur will gorbachev know and decid what to do and therefor the outsid world cannot know in advanc either absent upheav there ar two import differ between the domin soviet polici of the past and gorbachev s more paternalist approach first in the past moscow did not hesit to tell the east european leader both what thei should and should not do issu imper as well as prohibit todai moscow is satisfi with indic onli what thei should not do within the confin of such prohibit against leav the warsaw pact and renounc social the east european regim have gain suffici autonomi to decid on their own what sort of econom and even polit arrang would suit their circumst second moscow s major preoccup even more than in the past is the region s stabil mean peac and quiet at almost ani price a spontan popular upheav similar to that which engulf poland at the begin of thi decad is todai s soviet nightmar soviet offici know that larg scale east european disturb would weaken and perhap defeat perestroika and glasnost thi is why gorbachev fear of disord ha shi awai from try to dislodg the orthodox leader of still quiescent romania bulgaria czechoslovakia and east germani the more idealist goal of yesteryear creat a cohes and viabl socialist commonwealth ha been shelv for the time be yet even the limit and rel modest

chang at home is unwittingli fuel the fire of rapidli grow east european popular demand the ironi as zbigniew brzezinski ha observ is that if the viewpoint that a soviet militari intervent is in fact unlik becom more widespread in eastern europ thi percept might make a revolutionari upheav more probabl henc the underli problem is that while moscow seek peac and quiet in eastern europ the east european peopl feel encourag by gorbachev s domest politic and rhetor to seek chang in fact so basic is the chang thei propos in some countri that accord to a rudimentari but tell survei of public

that popul soviet intern relat textbook we read about roosevelt s polici against the soviet union truman s betray and the attempt by western politician dure the post war period to destroi the wartim allianc among the soviet union the unit state and great britain an allianc that gromyko saw as natur and benefici without ideal in ani wai the foreign polici of presid truman and the west dure the cold war i must note that gromyko did not understand or possibl did not want to understand the abnorm of a last allianc among the three gromyko see such a peac time allianc as a natur consequ of a war time allianc but the former wa in fact brought about onli by extraordinari circumst if gromyko s analysi had consid the differ of basic valu and institut between the unit state and the ussr rather than focus on superfici and pragmat distinct he would not have assign blame for the start of the cold war to truman s person or american nuclear monopoli but rather to the polit of stalin s regim almost in spite of himself gromyko show the unnatur of a post war allianc between the west and stalin when he write dure the confer churchil wa replac by prime minist clement attle but the new labor govern truli adopt the line taken by churchil and truman and attle easili found a common languag the veri fact that churchil wa replac by attle who then chose to pursu the polici of churchil and truman tell us that the reason for the post war split between the ussr and the unit state and britain ar not to be found in the machin of western politician but rather in the deep seat and basic differ between the goal and concern of the soviet union and the west the chapter from nixon to reagan is written in the same vein gromyko acknowledg advanc in arm control and in prepar for the salt 1
