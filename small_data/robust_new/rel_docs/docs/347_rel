the minist maintain how much self decept there is in thi claim is not that import in actual fact the ministri of environ and natur resourc ha not won on a singl major issu in the two year and six month of it exist the ministri ha not resolv on of the main problem of state administr in thi sphere a formula of the optimum combin of the need for feder regul of the us of natur resourc and supervis

stabl develop which russia sign in rio de janeiro the ministri ha on dozen of occas in the past two year occupi the posit of detach observ at the time of the govern s adopt of decis danger for the ecolog state of the countri the principl of the separ of state administr of the us of natur resourc from state supervis of wildlif manag which ha been establish by law ha not been put into practic hunt and fish resourc for exampl ar us and supervis by the same structur the ministri ha not organ the effici work of the feder ecolog fund the system of wildlif area which wa for a long time a model for other countri is fall apart on account of a lack of fund the interestingli conceiv environment safeti of russia program ha on foot in the grave the natur resourc bloc in the govern ha not succeed in realiz the idea if none of thi is not call a defeat what then is a defeat i shall dwell in more detail on the govern s decis on the develop of nuclear power engin of 28 decemb 1992 which the gentleman minist mention repeatedli i spoke at that session about the impermiss of a resumpt of the construct of nuclear electr power station for ecolog legal and econom reason the law doe not permit the adopt of such decis without the posit find of expert ecolog apprais thi wa confirm at that same session by justic minist nikolai fedorov todai presid of chuvashia also all wa decid howev by the speech of the minist of environ who support howev monstrou the posit of the ministri of atom energi public anger at thi decis of the govern develop into an appeal to the constitut court which as we know took over thi case i emphas onc again at that session that i am not an oppon of nuclear energi in principl as the gentleman minist tri to portrai me but i am for it environment safe develop in russia howev the develop of nuclear power engin accord to the propos plan entail unaccept environment risk it is indic incident that sever month later the state expert ecolog apprais in the absenc of the gentlemen minist it is true perhap the statu of politician as he call himself wa reflect here declin to approv the program of develop of the countri s nuclear power engin present by the ministri of atom energi and of cours our gentleman minist dissembl to put it mildli when he sai that that ill fate decre made no provis for the fund of the ministri of atom energi it wa mere to unti the ministri of atom energi s hand in the fund of the sector that thi decis wa adopt i am forc to censur the gentleman minist at least for incompet for hi claim that that decre contain no specif project that expert could examin both in accord with the law and in accord with iaea rule the choic of site is the first part of construct to what expert ecolog apprais wa the decis on the choic of site for the far east kostroma and other nuclear power station of which the govern decre make mention put there ha long been the need for public discuss of all problem of the develop of power engin it first need to be decid how much energi we need and where and then we need to determin from which sourc to obtain thi energi meanwhil howev it would seem that we do not have a shortag but a surplu of energi and we should not be build up capac but learn from other countri how to consum half as much energi per unit of manufactur product i would add that the ministri of environ and natur resourc ha done littl as yet to attract attent in russia to the new progress sourc of energi steam and ga turbin the technolog of the combust of coal in a fluidiz bed and other yet there ar calcul show that the replac of all nuclear power station unit not onli those be withdrawn ow to old ag by environment accept energi sourc would be for russia sever time cheaper than bring the current nuclear power station up to safeti requir similar to their western counterpart now a littl about the minist as a politician thi i would recal is what he call himself it had becom clear at the start of 1992 that neither the ministri nor the govern nor the suprem soviet had the resourc for resolv the problem of environment protect a muster of all unit wa need and the first all russia ecolog and environment protect congress which could have adopt a program of russia s ecolog reviv wa seen as be such earlier such program had been adopt by the cpsu central committe and the council of minist but thi could no longer be done now by the compet structur alon without the most activ particip of industrialist scienc the bank and the public all were agre that such a congress need to be prepar as a matter of urgenc and the correspond action program which had been discuss at the ministri of environ and natur resourc collegium wa drawn up but the minist person revis the decis of the collegium and persuad a rutskoi to head the organ committe prepar the congress the latter agre provid it is said that he would not be burden with ani congress busi thi buri with full honor the whole idea of the congress the minist need not a congress but polit proxim to rutskoi and rutskoi need a congress even less so an ecolog congress did not take place in 1993 now the idea of the congress ha been taken up by the trade union movement i veri much hope that such a congress will be held for all that and will assist thi as best as i can and i would like to sai thi further about polit the gentleman minist explain hi involv in the elect on the russia s choic platform by the fact that thi movement express interest in the develop of a strong ecolog program but where is it thi strong ecolog program and why ha our govern up to now declin to develop and implement it for anyon with an interest in the parti and movement ecolog program it is obviou that the russia s choic ecolog program is far from the strongest it would seem that it wa not ecolog but some other polici which guid the minist in thi case as in the case with a rutskoi also not onli my attent i believ wa attract by the minist s attempt to justifi the combin of posit in the govern and in parliament by an analog with other countri in other countri the situat is fundament differ from our there the member of the parti which is the winner at the elect becom minist with us on the other hand minist occupi the seat of deputi and it is quit odd when a minist is elect by territori constitu how can he combin the duti of serv primarili the interest of hi constitu with hi feder oblig of not have favorit in the region i would recal that our minist attempt to get elect from nizhegorod oblast becaus perhap there ar mani ministri of atom energi enterpris there and that onli after have fail there wa he includ in the extraterritori part of the russia s choic feder slate a progress economist who understand that a sound economi mai exist onli with a sound ecolog wa propos for the posit of minist in novemb 1991 it is said that suvorov shaken by the scale of the embezzl of public fund maintain that ani suppli offic could after a year be execut without trial or investig it would seem that the minist of environ even if veri good at the time of hi appoint need to be remov after 18 month at the most a person is incap of resist for ani longer than thi the pressur of hi superior minist friend and foreign compani the gentleman minist s strike super optim whatev the subject the effici of the work of the ministri or of himself or the qualiti of the environ is help him evid justifi hi own inconsist and indecis in defens of the environ but for the state and societi and for us all thi polit posit of the minist is simpli danger ps as presidenti advis for the environ and health care in 1991 1993 i wa larg respons for the failur in the sphere of ecolog that have been describ as also for the self appoint of professor vi danilov danilyan as minist the statut on the secur council of russia interdepartment commiss for environment safeti recent approv by the presid record the commiss s decis ar to be examin by the organ of state power if

these forest lack the realli old tree the dead and rot tree and veget that mani fungi beetl moss and lichen need for surviv we have talk a lot in finland about forestri and how to take care of our manag forest without pai enough attent to the ecolog dimens and the multipl of speci said chief supervisor pertti rassi of the environ ministri nor ha enough research been done in the 1980 s on the effect effici forestri ha had on the flora and fauna in our forest but now there is agreement that ecolog must be taken into account in forest manag and no irrepar damag ha yet occur accord to rassi he is also chairman of the work group that is make an inventori of finland s old forest the inventori of southern finland is complet but work is still be done on a list of forest in lapland there is also a polit consensu on the need to protect our last natur forest and the govern could issu a direct as earli as next week on the preserv of around 10 000 hectar of state own forestland in southern finland there is also a need to protect around 5 000 hectar of privat land but accord to rassi thi will be an expens oper thicket scrub growth scarc around two third of finland is cover with forest todai and around 2 percent of the forest ar part of a protect area in the southern part of the countri onli 1 percent of the forest ar protect the big protect area ar north of uleaborg accord to rassi there ar also gap in the map that wa done to determin the protect need in lapland south of the arctic circl and there is a special need for increas forest protect in thi area we estim that there ar at least 65 000 hectar of forest worth protect in lapland said rassi whose work group ha now receiv an expand mandat to inventori the lapland forest most of the project protect area ar locat on state own land even if region forestri board were reprimand for log and inadequ protect of their forest there would be no veri old forest left on privat own land rassi point out privat forest and those belong to log compani have been manag accord to econom principl in order to produc the biggest possibl yield research lag behind sound forestri becam a common term back in the 1980 s but the concept wa not given much weight in finland accord to the environ ministri supervisor biodivers and the multipl of speci have been lack in forest research here while in sweden for exampl it ha been includ in research sinc the 1970 s when thei began discuss these issu there the endang speci in finland that have receiv the most public and ar dy out precis becaus of the lack of old forest ar the white back woodpeck and the fly squirrel but there ar also other woodpeck speci and mani kind of beetl and fungi that do not surviv in manag forest there is not enough space for speci that live sole in thicket or in old scrub growth in particular when consid which area should be preserv and protect forest ag and structur ar taken into account rassi note the idea is to make it possibl to ensur the surviv of speci in these area and to provid a suffici vari forest environ that also contain old and rot tree speci must now be preserv the basi for forest manag todai on that all side ar in rel agreement on is to prevent other speci from dy out in our forest rassi said on problem is that as a result of the lack of research in the 1980 s we lack a clear pictur of what ha actual been lost he complain but if we look at research result from sweden and try to appli them here around 15 percent of finnish forest should be protect to safeguard biodivers preserv the anim speci that exist todai will be a veri demand task accord to rassi to do thi approxim 1 million hectar of forest would have to be design as protect area and we ar not yet even halfwai there he said there ar simpli not enough econom resourc to protect all the forest that should be includ howev forestri can be manag differ and in recent month the peopl in charg of practic log oper in the forest have been retrain in accord with the principl of sound forestri rassi said there is also agreement on which method ar sound he said so these kind of measur should eventu be seen in the forest on problem when on discuss forest and growth is that the time perspect is so long that it is hard to see the result of variou measur in the period of a singl gener forest get along without us it will be five or 10 year befor we have research result that tell us what should be done in the forest even though we need the result now rassi point out much time will be lost befor the decis that ar made by politician and the author get down to the concret level in the forest i fear the worst that could happen is a failur to prevent more speci from becom extinct and a continu declin in the number of speci that caus irrepar damag if we get into a situat where fungi lichen and beetl have disappear and the forest cannot get along without human assist and intervent we will have caus irrepar damag he point out in the past forest renew themselv as a result of forest fire for exampl and rassi think control burn is still a good wai to renew forest unfortun it is also an expens method he note the ag structur in our forest is such that the forest ar now grow older and effici forestri and manag forest have not caus ani damag that cannot be repair in rassi s opinion he is now hope for a comprehens inventori that also includ privat
