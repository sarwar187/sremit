it wa onli a tini fraction of the real goznak s size but thi wa not a problem it is just what i want why take the troubl of build a press the size of a three stori build if on no bigger than a televis set will do exactli the same thing karmaz as a nonprofession i would think that the watermark would be the most difficult part of the process then there would be the problem of copi the design the color and so forth am i right baranov in principl ye although all of the stage ar difficult i can tell you that i spent 3 5 year get the watermark right and the color took anoth 2 5 year although i did come up with the press right awai i rememb that the investig ask me to conduct an experi and print a bill in the inspector s offic all of the gener and all of the bigwig from moscow came to see thi no on could believ that monei could be print with equip take up no more space than two write desk the first thing i did wa to print the watermark lenin s profil after that just for fun i print the

podberezkin rau corpor presid and academician of the russian academi of natur scienc nation secur russia in 1994 todai more than ever befor we need a critic analysi of the path we have travers and a clear object for societi s further develop after all we find ourselv at an histor crossroad there is no turn back but we still have to choos the new road within a veri brief period of time the countri ha move from on histor period to anoth there ha been a radic chang of state structur an end ha been put in russia to the previou polit system which wa underpin by the cpsu monopoli of power and ideolog a headlong chang is under wai in the correl of form of ownership in russia and correspondingli in the entir system of social interrel there is a grow accumul of interethn contradict within russia and of problem with former ussr republ which ar now sovereign state there ha been a fundament chang in russia s posit in the world commun and in it mutual relat with foreign state in thi context it is necessari to clearli defin the current and long term russian nation interest which correspond with the interest of individu citizen and of societi as a whole it is necessari to highlight those on which the veri exist of our state depend in our view the main point todai is to prevent the weaken and collaps of the russian state but how is thi to be avoid have defin the prioriti it would be expedi to elabor a program of reform in the interest of societi as a whole and not in the interest of individu group thi program will obvious be nationwid it must be comrehens realist and pragmat it must not be burden by ani polit bia citizen have the right and even the duti to know what kind of bright futur thei ar offer how will reform be implement and how long thei will take thei ar fulli entitl not onli to ask question about all thi but also to altogeth disagre with the propos program and ultim to demand an account of the govern s activ the wai to nation accord must be sought on the basi of respect for the individu and each citizen s right regardl of parti religi or nation affili what we need todai is a govern capabl of find a wai out of the crisi onli a program gear to the need of the major of the popul will enjoi the popul s support thi is also the onli wai to achiev the consolid of all progress forc it is necessari to curb inflat restor confid in the rubl and creat a normal function financi state mechan gear to support for produc rather than for dealer how do we propos to begin first to abandon the excess of polit struggl and to strengthen legal law and order and elementari execut disciplin without which ani power is doom to anarchi in other word to strengthen the state second to undertak a seri of measur to improv live condit for the russian feder s citizen and primarili for the least well off section pension children the sick and those unabl to work third to uphold russia s uniti and it econom and polit independ fourth to reviv russia s spiritu potenti the main threat is the weaken of power and statehood ani weaken of ani of the branch of power mean the weaken of power and statehood as a whole it is extrem shortsight to sow the branch on which you ar perch it would be much wiser to reciproc strengthen the repres execut and judici branch of power we offer for your attent an analysi of the situat and a packag of measur to strengthen the state section i i preserv of civil peac of an integr and independ russian state 1 preserv of civil peac and accord arm conflict and local war ar increasingli often wage along russia s border the fatherland is on the threshold of a war which could begin either on it border or beyond them it ha in fact alreadi begun therefor the main task todai is to prevent it escal into all out war for thi purpos we need primarili nation uniti and accord no matter how the situat in the countri mai develop it is impermiss to make the state depend on victori by differ view or polit forc politician and their ambit even the most outstand on come and go but russia live on ani polit victori would turn into defeat if a blow is dealt on statehood and societi slide toward confront it is imposs to achiev stabil and accord in societi unless an end is put to the divis into our and their into correct and guilti there is alreadi widespread us of the terminomoli and methodolog of psycholog warfar which ar us dure prepar for the conduct of combat oper against oppon who will have to be sooner or later destroi the divis of citizen into victor and vanquish is a state crime becaus it lead directli to civil war in order to avoid thi and halt thi movement toward direct confront lead politician should be made to first abandon person parti interest in the conduct of affair and promot state interest to the foreground second to find within themselv the courag to ceas the endless search for enemi and declar the respons and repent of all for the catastroph which ha befallen russia our histori show that precis thi spiritu moral approach ha alwai underpin russia s extric from crisi in thi context it is necessari to impos a direct legisl ban on the propaganda of enmiti equat it with call for civil war and introduc penalti for the public of unverifi inform detriment to the state and to civil peac but without prevent journalist engag in critic base on fact democraci and it principl must becom a mean for strengthen rather than weaken the state not a singl polit forc can or should claim to be absolut correct and consequ to exercis absolut power it is necessari to consolid all forc in societi without divid them into red white brown and so on thi approach ha prove pernici for our statehood over the last few decad the econom chao todai ha been compound by interethn conflict the collaps of moral foundat and cultur heritag and final the crisi of polit power instead of a middl class which in all civil societi compris the scientif technic and creativ intelligentsia skill worker and entrepreneur we have creat a minut privileg stratum of dealer while the remain strata ar undergo headlong lumpen at no time and in no place ha thi path ever creat a reliabl support for democraci and state power in societi it is paradox but for mani year on end the state ha pursu an antist polici aim at the disintegr and elimin of it most import institut the armi nation domest polici and the state secur system the most acut problem face the state todai ar a to prevent a civil war b to strengthen the state institut c to prevent russia s collaps d to overcom the socioeconom crisi and save the nation e to preserv scienc cultur and educ cadr pose an especi acut problem when promot peopl to the lever of state administr societi envisag a system of measur to train administr cadr all over the world includ prerevolutionari russia ani citizen who wish to becom a profession politician ha to go through the school of upbring educ and practic befor he is allow access to polit activ in local organ of power in order to be launch into state level orbit the candid ha to climb a long ladder of practic work and train in the unit state befor a citizen can hold promin offic he is polish in a prestigi univers and in the cours of work abroad in the ministri includ the state depart and the cia or parti apparatu in congress and so on the result is a skill functionari meet the need of hi societi s rule circl but even here mistak cannot be avoid the polar of polit forc and their grow confront take the most uncivil form in russia not onli did not end with the elimin of the russian feder suprem soviet but ar actual intensifi the elect campaign consider stimul thi process consequ it is probabl that on section of the rule elit will succe in crystal into a clearli defin parti structur which will attempt to establish control first over the govern and then over the presid de facto reviv the on parti polit system the access of such a parti to power will in turn inevit lead first to a clash between the presid and the feder assembl and then to a leadership struggl within the rule parti itself unfortun the histori of the ussr and the cpsu offer us numer tragic exampl of such develop of event in thi context from the state s point of view there is need for measur for legisl and polit regul of parti activ make provis for temporari suspens of the activ of all parti and sociopolit organ in the event that the natur of their polit activ becom damag to the state s secur thi kind of decis and thi is of fundament import must be made and monitor by the suprem organ of state power subject to on immut condit polit decis must under no circumst becom the prerog of execut and monitor organ like the mvd ministri of intern affair the ministri of secur the prosecutor s offic and so on in our view the ideal author to make such decis would be the judiciari the real strengthen of the aithor and potenti of the judiciari must becom a prioriti task in russia s state build base our analysi on the suprem interest of the state and the nation we have conclud that firm author is need todai the most effect indisput and bloodless form for russia could be an interim presidenti rule monitor by the feder assembl if we were to leav asid polit bia and the ambit of polit leader and forc desir to make capit out of discord in russia we ar confid that mani of our fellow citizen would agre even an imperfect leader of the nation is better than a group of polit leader look primarili after their own interest and corrupt element strain to come to power dure the most difficult time in russia s histori feudal strife invas the time of troubl the countri emerg victori have mobil all it resourc and the spiritu potenti of the mass under a singl leader s leadership the soviet era wa no except see that stalin s dictatorship wa object a posit factor of victori in world war ii and of the countri s reemerg from the ruin the press occasion write that russia todai feel not onli the urgent need but even the inevit of the appear of an authoritarian regim capabl of extric the countri from the crisi some peopl assum that russia ha alreadi taken thi path and therefor the question is not how to avoid a transit to authoritarian but to choos it most accept form and the method for transit we it is said have alreadi diverg from the possibl form and norm of a develop democrat state in the transit period it is therefor necessari to accept thi fact as an object exist realiti and second to try and find a method peac and the on most accept for the state of transit to on of the more prefer form of authoritarian thi assum that new qualiti will be demand of the repres of the authoritarian form of rule leader of the nation rather than of a parti staunch defend of the state and it interest rather than leader of reform a builder rather than a destroy in other word a major revis of the prioriti and valu which have been domin in the last few year the list of these charact qualiti could be logic extend to includ a seriou chang in the disposit of polit forc the transform of recent alli and friend into polit oppon and the obvers the attract of broad strata of profession and specialist not commit to ani on polit parti or movement it mai happen that instead of authoritarian we could end up with incess struggl intrigu by differ group parti and junta and attempt coup with the state and the nation at stake ani such struggl which ha becom an accept form of exist for these leader and a part of their essenc will inevit and for a long time to come hinder and delai the stabil of the situat in the countri and will weaken our might the countri s earliest possibl extric from the crisi and the gradual format of durabl democrat foundat of a civil societi ar import for russia becaus real democraci is possibl onli in a societi where there ar no mortal threat against the state and the nation 2 improv of the feder structur prevent of region fragment what should russia be like follow the disappear of the superpow the soviet union from the world map it former constitut call it the russian feder but is thi realli true a genuin feder is possibl onli when two or sever state ar unit and as a rule it is base on last integr without the right to seced the autonomi of a union state s compon is guarante insofar as it doe not threaten the state s uniti precis thi principl wa us in form the major of feder state exist todai the unit state switzerland canada germani true enough some other state also style themselv as feder argentina brazil mexico venezuela india and spain for exampl essenti howev thei ar unitari state with a certain amount of autonomi for their provinc pseudofeder in the classic sens of the word world experi ha shown that a durabl feder state is possibl onli when it is form by autonom state keen to unit by dint of variou vital import reason more recent histor exampl alreadi prove that ani attempt to creat a feder out of immatur nation and territori format inevit engend instabl and disintegr which swiftli lead to the collaps of newli form state or the format of a unitari state the soviet union wa a feder onli in name proclaim by it constitut but in essenc wa in our view a typic pseudofeder it is well known that a treati between a seri of republ wa conclud in 1922 but in the strict jurid and legal sens not a singl on of the compon agre to the union wa a state as for the rsfsr russian soviet feder socialist republ as on of the contract parti to the creation of the ussr from the veri begin it wa also a pseudofeder both in form and in it inner composit the conclus of the feder treati in it present form did not solv the problem either with whom did the feder compon conclud the treati with the feder state structur to be precis if thei repres a singl state it emerg that the russian it numer largest peopl compris more than 80 percent of the popul ar dispers among the feder compon sinc their own statehood is not even mention furthermor tatarstan and the chechen republ did not sign the feder treati while the stanc of a seri of republ and region as regard the distribut of power is threaten the russian feder s uniti it is fair to ask is the newli emerg russia not a wors variat of the same old pseudofeder it ha to be object note that ever sinc the collaps of the russian empir the ethnic russian have been gradual lose their statehood thi is the fundament question of our commun s develop in view of all that ha been said abov will russia be abl to becom a genuin feder state the fatherland s histori contain sever exampl of attempt to impos a feder unif of territori dure the kievan period right until the invas by the golden hord dure the suzdal muscovi period dure the time of troubl and in 1917 right after the februari revolut it is of cours possibl todai to blame the soviet power for fail to take everyth into consider when form the sovereign republ but the main point is that mani peopl acquir or restor their statehood precis thank to the soviet power the pull toward integr and uniti of the peopl of both russia and the former ussr stem from numer factor the territori which thei inhabit eurasia throughout the mani centuri of their exist these peopl have on mani occas unit within state format and have produc uniqu cultur and singl spiritu area thei perceiv eurasia as their motherland contin whose fate is insepar from the fate of each on of it peopl experi show that whenev the eurasian ethnic group have fail to reach accord their land have becom easi prei for aggressor the struggl for eurasia s repartit could disrupt the world geopolit equilibrium and caus a global catastroph anoth common featur of russia s peopl is the highli polyetnn natur of all newli form state onli six of the multitud of russian peopl claim more than 50 percent of indigen popul in their republ the chuvash account for 69 percent the tuvinian for 64 percent the komi permyak for 60 percent the chechen for 58 percent the buryat in aga buryat autonom okrug for 54 percent and the ossetian for 53 percent the averag indigen popul in all russian feder republ is 32 percent and even less 10 5 percent in autonom okrug it is simpli imposs to divid all thi into some sort of state format the follow conclus suggest itself russia s peopl ar destin to live in on state feder in spirit and form so what ar the wai to solv the nation state question in russia there ar two main danger appar in the possibl develop of nation process todai the first is the uncontrol explos of russian nation as a natur defens reaction to the threat of russia s fragment and to the insult of nation digniti take the form of the russophobia and chauvin typic of some former union republ and of individu nation region in russia itself but the establish of nationalist dictatorship is no solut the lament experi of such dictatorship and regim in a seri of state which emerg on the territori of the ussr offer convinc proof of thi territori and state collaps is as a rule the price that ha to be paid for the triumph of nation idea the second danger li in the attempt to turn russia back to it prerevolut state structur divid it into guberniya in practic term thi would mean the forc colon of nation republ the right which non russian peopl have acquir can no longer be withdrawn or curtail without tragic consequ for them and for the russian nation russian or ani other nation will not onli lead inevit to the destruct of russia s integr but will also render the statehood of these veri peopl just a pipedream the ideal wai to a genuin feder state is to conclud a full blood feder treati between the republ russia s krai and oblast as feder compon must enjoi equal right with the republ with a possibl subsequ establish of new integr format guberniya laender the more extens the level of self govern the more last will be the real integr between feder compon includ the russian region the comprehensivess of thi integr elimin the problem of the russian nation s possibl self dismember in the event that krai and oblast ar elev to the level of republ thu feder could be found simultan on the nation state nation territori and territori principl which would be most in line with russia s specif featur there is need to constitution enshrin the right of nation group and the guarante of cultur autonomi in thi process it will be import to sensibl distribut power between central and local organ of power and administr sinc the two organ of power parliament and govern combin all the origin featur of a multin state in the person of deputi and member of the govern thei would appear to personifi to a larg extent the compon of the feder and their peopl and then the center s authoritarian within the limit of it power would be accept with understand on the other hand authoritarian in the form of a presidenti republ in russia s specif condit could spark off conflict which would be diffitul to overcom and in the event of the adopt of decis which mai be disadvantag for some of it compon it mai even prompt nation agit and protest nonetheless experi show that at critic moment in histori authoritarian as a temporari measur mai be necessari and furthermor justifi the format of a genuin feder russian state will offer an opportun to reviv the larg lost ti with nearbi foreign countri the time and extent of thi new rapproch of peopl from the former ussr will depend primarili on russia s stabil and prosper thi will happen sooner or later and when it doe the eurasian contin will see the emerg of a new commun of free peopl and state qualit differ from all other in the past mainli due to the genuin feder principl underpin it build if oblast even enlarg on ural republ far east republ and so on were to be given the right to have their own parliament constitut embassi and so on thi would run contrari to both intern experi and common sens ani sovereign of administr oblast in todai s condit will lead to the feder s transform into a confeder in light of the current weaken of power thi would be the quickest wai to the state s collaps with all the ensu econom and social consequ which would be extrem seriou for all evid of thi can be seen in the consequ of the soviet union s collaps a strengthen of separat is also possibl even if compon do not formal seced from the feder someth which can alreadi be notic todai what attitud should be taken toward the strive of the leadership of some sovereign republ to take advantag of the feder state s weaken so as to expand their right still further and acquir a special statu in the feder someth like associ member practic ha convincingli confirm that ani excess expans of compon right lead to a weaken and even the collaps of the feder case of secess from the feder by joint accord of all interest side ar isol the state of singapor from malaysia other attempt secess have usual been put down by forc the sonderbund in switzerland the southern state in the unit state

and it result can have onli a polit not a legal signific the threat to seced from the feder which can be heard everi now and again run contrari to both the constitut and the feder treati therefor thei have no legal effect and in our view ought to be resolut cut short bear in mind the vast advantag which the republ have alreadi gain thank to their membership of the russian feder their leader ought to abandon their attempt to further expand their right to the point which is tantamount to secess while the legitim right of republ and oblast ought to be cover by addit treati with the feder the forc

should these function be restor on a new basi on the basi of democraci and market relat howev commit to democraci and market relat by itself is not a state idea which can unit multin russia in a unifi state the birth of specif method of transform just like of a state idea is pain nowadai have to fight through the complex of the past and the contradict of the present the basic criteria in thi process could be the minim of social loss the spiritu humanist and moral orient of transform and the balanc of the interest of the world commun and of the russian feder s peopl todai just like in 1991 russia is face the task of how to realli becom sovereign an analysi of the past two year show increasingli clearli that not a singl on of the ni includ russia wa prepar either polit or econom or psycholog for sovereign exist the end of 1991 saw the format of 15 protost without border armi monetari system infrastructur state or nation interest full blood economi and so on it ought to be conclud that even todai not a singl on of these state is full blood in thi sens consequ in 1994 just as in the two preced year their develop will be determin by the follow block of problem a complet the format of sovereign state with all state attribut b creat an effect system of mutual relat between the ni c join the polit militari econom and other system exist in the world open presuppos meet the other state halfwai establish new mutual relat with them and expand the sphere of these relat convers sovereign of each ni and it separ from the union would mean draw awai from it former neighbor in the commun state a certain step up of autarki breakdown of exist ti and alien thi contradict determin the logic of mutual relat between the ni which develop in two opposit direct first there wa an increasingli notic manifest of interst relat establish of custom regim and border most republ the baltic countri ukrain kyrgyzstan moldova georgia azerbaijan belaru kazakhstan ar introduc either

account is be establish and so on second integr feel ar grow or at least the desir for an earli break is weaken in most former republ except latvia and estonia and partli lithuania and turkmenistan nonetheless todai it is still prematur to talk of integr or disintegr what we ar observ for the time be is the coexist not of the ni but of real author at differ level in these ni for exampl how is it possibl to treat as part of russian kazakhstani relat the tripartit polit econom union of kazakhstan tatarstan and bashkortostan which wa sign in august 1992 and under which bashkortostan ceas deliv oil product to russian depart in 1994 it will be necessari either to make effort to place russia s relat with the ni on the firm basi of intern law or to creat suprast structur with power of author it is more than like that both form will develop in the immedi futur the format of civil relat between the ni will be influenc by the follow factor the incomplet disintegr of the ussr as a result of which the subject of interst relat have not been final defin it is possibl that their number mai be either increas if separat intensifi in russia moldova georgia ukrain and so on or reduc if the process of integr ar intensifi two fundament differ principl ar clearli manifest the nation territori separ into autonom republ and nation territori format and the region separ into pure russian region analysi show that the russian feder s disintegr will hardli end up as a sovereignti bandwagon of autonom format the indigen etnnic group repres even a rel major in onli 11 out of the 31 nation territori format separatist mood ar intensifi in proper russian region in the far east the ural kuban siberia thi ha not been observ either in the ni or in east european countri the follow forecast can be made for 1994 retent of an economi with a price structur out of kilter with world price in 1993 russia suppli product to the ni at price equival to 30 40 percent of world price while purchas from them at price equival to 70 percent of world price and consequ russia had a posit balanc of about 750 billion rubl in trade with the ni in the first six month deterior of the situat of etnnic russian in the ni have becom an ethnic minor there the situat is be aggrav by the fact that virtual all the ni be multin have opt for the nationalist idea in strengthen the state lukewarm attitud of the world commun primarili of the g 7 countri toward individu ni and the structur of mutual relat prevail in the post soviet area it ought to be note in thi context that first in 1992 1993 the major of ni lost their illus about western aid but certain hope remain that some would be integr within the ec while other would draw closer to asian countri and would enjoi their support second there is a steadili grow econom depend on the west and third there is an increasingli clearli manifest tendenc by the west to pursu mainli it own interest in relat with the ni for exampl squeez russia out of the arm market and other technolog market increas purchas of energi sourc from russia at the expens of deliveri to nearbi foreign countri and so on sever system of collabor between the ni will be form in 1994 in on wai or anoth prioriti is be given to the problem of structur the geopolit area with the aim of boost stabil in the region and the manag of polit process 5 wai to form a civil societi term

we have to form a civil societi as a ramifi network of social relat and institut independ of the state express the will and protect the interest of citizen bear in mind the popul s low standard of

third thi trend persist also in 1993 but the number of record crime hardli reflect the true pictur accord to some expert estim recent there have been some 10 12 million crime commit in russia each

accord to expert estim these relat involv up to 40 percent of entrrepreneur and two third of all commerci structur so far the effort to combat thi grow threat have fail to produc ani tangibl result thi threat ha not even been legisl defin therefor we feel that the best possibl definit is contain in the un secretari gener s report a organ crime is the activ of associ or crimin individu or group

viewpoint held by variou polit group and variou social strata of the popul from a sounder point of view it can be seen that a chang of govern and of author in gener will inevit result in replac the immatur inconsist at time simpli foolish and clumsi democraci but democraci nonetheless with a quasi democraci thi is the ground on which intellectu determin their attitud toward the govern todai but from the fundament posit the present situat call more for understand rather than for approv or condemn to comprehend and to announc it conclus to societi thi is the function of the new intelligentsia politician intellectu parti and movement want success a member of the intelligentsia want the truth by it veri natur the new intelligentsia need more than anyth els the fullest possibl democraci and it is the on that can util it best of all thi mean that it is capabl of be a kind of regul of the degre and form of democraci the new intelligentsia is also the bearer of optim in a societi of skeptic

swiftli deal with it polit the multiparti system which is capabl of produc a seriou struggl for power is still at it embryon stage as it were in our countri nonetheless we ar inde at a stage of crisi at present and thi crisi is moral the main question face russia now is what should be the moral guidelin of it futur state build thi question ha to be answer by the peopl themselv it would be appropri to recal the tradit form of dialogu between the suprem power and the peopl by conven an assembl of the land which could compris authorit repres of all social and profession group and the tradit religi

currenc on balanc sheet if thei were to be adjust for inflat thei would be sharpli reduc the main caus of inflat ar the sharp declin of product the arbitrari price set by enterpris in condit of

lead to an imbal between the monei in circul and the commod avil for purchas error in the implement of econom reform and the super rigid monetarist credit polici togeth with confus in calcul have intensifi the slump in product and fuel inflat the main lever for hold inflat back ought to be the credit support for viabl enterpris if enterpris do not receiv credit to meet product cost and cover

commod produc enterpris ar in debt thi is confirm by the correl of the growth of price and of monei in circul over a two year period the former increas by a factor of between 100 and 1 000 while the

five year ago the countri would have need trillion of rubl to replac worn out equip and thu ensur simpl reproduct thi account for 50 to 60 percent of all fix asset in product at todai s price the

therefor in order to reviv the economi we will be unabl to manag without inflationari credit emiss but a credit emiss that is accur verifi and control it must be note that in a healthi econom system high interest rate ar set in order to reduc inflat in our own condit todai high interest rate prompt a faster pace of price increas and further devalu of monei fast growth of commod product can be achiev by lower interest rate while acceler the turnov of fund and provid target credit for the economi thi mean an econom effect for both creditor and commod produc thi is the wai to extric ourselv

destruct of what ha alreadi been creat will continu without such an agreement without ani organ principl the monetari credit system the dispar between the bank system model in russia and other countri is the main caus hinder their integr in a singl financi area the model appli in russia ar substanti differ from the model of the world s bank busi and encourag the specul commerci accumul of capit rather than it invest in product suppli commod to the market the second import reason hinder the integr of the russian and the world s monetari credit system is the underdevelop of modern long term form of settlement in russia in these condit the attempt to elabor the best possibl cours in credit polici and reform the system of settlement in the nation economi is perceiv by the central bank of russia as a prioriti task the object of the bank of russia s monetari credit polici ar enshrin in the basic guidelin of monetari credit regul in 1993 ratifi by the suprem soviet and in the 24 mai 1993

guidelin for particip in econom relat proceed from the premis that the rate of inflat depend on the rate of monei suppli it ought to be expect that after a certain time lag credit restrict should result in a slow down of price increas but inflat stood at 20 percent in june 22 percent in juli 26 percent in august and 23 percent in septemb dure the first nine month of 1993 wholesal and consum price increas by a factor of 7 3 and 6 3 respect thu the basic approach toward the curb of inflat ha prove useless the rise price of energi sourc of ga in februari and of coal in juli remain the main factor of inflat the monopoli statu of individu group of produc provid the main caus of the acceler increas of wholesal price and after a brief interv of consum price as well inflat in russia is expect to reach 900 to 1 000 percent in 1993 as a whole the state of the monetari credit sphere remain veri complex it is not onli instabl in the economi but also uncertainti as regard the state

might be requir in order to avoid it and thi in it turn will lead to an expans of unsatisfi effect demand and higher rate of inflat the graviti of thi threat is prove even more graphic by the fact

is to achiev guarante live and work condit for russian outsid the russian feder which not onli would rule out ani encourag of their departur but also would realli creat prerequisit for the preserv of their nation tradit languag cultur and nation self awar we perceiv thi prospect as the develop of econom cultur and polit trend aim against ani attempt to establish reactionari ethnocrat regim on the vast space of the former union it is of cours hardli possibl to reli on object reintegr tendenc for reviv that which ha collaps under the weight of accumul contradict and gross error by shortsight politician there is no subjunct mood in histori there is howev an altern to such a develop of event but it is lament it is first the loss of econom independ by the newli form state includ russia follow the disintegr of the singl econom area and the nation econom complex which wa unifi until the recent past their distinct western and their transform into underdevelop appendag of major western countri with a mafia crimin domest econom and polit structur it is second the intent or unintent flare up of inter nation or interethn conflict either as a result of the exacerb and deterior of the socioeconom situat and the impoverish of broad strata of the popul or due to the insolubl of question pertain to nation state belong of variou territori militari properti and other categori of former

which a special type of eurasian civil start develop a long time ago across the space of russia and it associ territori the preserv of on s own state ident todai is a question not onli of human

includ and let us have no illus on thi account in russia itself and will becom a power factor for the develop of interst conflict pretend not to realiz thi mean directli encourag such a develop of event 2 polit aspect a legitim wai out of the situat from all point of view could be provid onli by restor of the common econom cultur and legal area uncondit remov of trade barrier introduct of benefit for member of the new econom and defens union adopt of common citizenship in the ninth year of perestroyka and after three year of democrat russia lack a clear foreign polici concept there ha been no definit of russia s prioriti or a concept of the new integr cooper across the former ussr thi is precis why the sluggish activ of the ci ha produc no posit result russia s nation prioriti must inde be the interest of the peopl of the russian feder and of the largest among them the russian peopl which ha for centuri been russia s unifi nucleu and ha alreadi prove it consolid role consequ all diplomat foreign polit and foreign econom effort must focu primarili on russia s allianc with the former union republ which have a larg proport of russian and russian speak popul thei ar primarili ukrain kazakhstan belaru estonia latvia uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and moldova thi will make it possibl to solv the problem of almost 90 percent of ethnic russian and of mani russian citizen who ar resid in these state it is in russia s nation interest and regardless of the russian diaspora s size to further strengthen the allianc with central asian republ which have prove their commit to the idea of uniti at the most critic time for russia 3 toward integr via coordin there is an impress that out of the entir packag of problem on whose solut the ci ought to be work attent todai is focus onli on two aspect the suppli of russian raw materi and fuel to the ni and the combat involv of russian troop under ci auspic in conflict on the territori of the former ussr and yet the question of paramount import for the peac period of develop settl the issu of citizen right ar hardli ever on the agenda the ci todai certainli need an organ capabl of coordin humanitarian question and eas the pressur of state border on the collect and individu right of citizen of ani nation the ci collect organ could also coordin the process of reform it is hard to reviv our econom mechan while differ part of the ci implement diverg concept of transit to market economi like for exampl when the western republ adher to the genuin sensibl limit of initi privat while russia is engag exclus in macroprivat the destat of harbor and airport oil and gold field and industri giant the problem that could be resolv onli within the framework of a singl socioeconom area ar consider more numer than it might appear at first

as well as the provis of complet secondari and higher educ in the nativ languag togeth with question concern the pension provis for peopl who work in the ussr and ar now live in ci state no matter how sad thi mai be to admit but the initi built in disintegr factor still domin the concept of the ci two year later the reason is the lack of a concept of unif of a backbon around which a real as oppos to a nomin commun mai be develop russian and european experi alik show that a real and dynam foundat for the re creation of a singl humanitarian econom and defens area can be provid by the interest of ethnic minor detach from their nucleu includ the largest among them the russian a concept capabl of switch the ci to the track of construct collabor will emerg onli when we abandon the demagogueri abour russian chauvin and all the other tag recent attach to the nation which succeed in realli ralli the peopl on on sixth of the earth s surfac 4 problem of migrat without a forecast of the true extent of migrat it is difficult to determin what financi resourc will be requir to compens refuge and forc migrant for the damag thei have suffer and to provid facil for new settler the number of job that will have to be creat for them the real burden that will be impos on the social infrastructur at place where migrant will concentr and so on the return of russian from former ussr republ and the migrat of repres of non russian peopl to russia began long befor interethn tension reach the stage of open conflict and becam a bargain chip in polit struggl even back in 1979 1988 the posit balanc of the migrat to russia by russian who had formerli activ resettl in other republ wa in excess of 300 000 the growth of the scale of migrat wa also affect by the outflow of nonindigen peopl from region where non russian titular ethnic group had concentr in russia itself the northern caucasu the volga vallei the siberian transbayk region and the northern belt of the feder in essenc these region show the selfsam symptom of discrimin against repres of nontitular ethnic group as in nearbi foreign countri among the advers consequ of mass migrat realli great import attach to the growth of social stress there is a signific deterior of the social awar of migrant themselv who have lost their former statu and quit often the prospect of social success there is also dissatisfact among the resid of town and villag where thei live unfortun the help given to forc migrant or refuge by the local organ of power and popul is clearli inadequ the attempt by migrant to acquir a social nich in the new local come up against seriou object difficulti the level of social tension ha increas wherev refuge ar concentr as soon as thei have appear thi is note both by the migrant themselv and by local resid the social and psycholog atmospher in which refuge find themselv is also indic by the result of a poll of the popul in 13 russian feder region when ask what polici do you support the answer were distribut as follow as percentag of the number poll accept citizen of all former ussr republ regardless of their nation 36 percent accept onli russian by descent 51 percent do not accept anyon 11 percent did not answer 2 percent on out of everi 10 person poll is against the accept of migrant while on half of those poll ar inclin toward divid refuge and migrant into our peopl and foreign these stereotyp of mass and individu awar cannot be ignor thei were graphic demonstr in practic in saratov and volgograd oblast dure the discuss of the question of settl german there and re creat a german autonom format in the volga vallei the local popul s unwelcom attitud toward migrant will intensifi as the shortag of foodstuff hous and so on worsen thi can alreadi be seen at present respond of the all russia poll were ask what will be your attitud if refuge which mai appear in your region ar alloc hous out of turn ar given job and ar help with monei from the state budget the answer were as follow 1 attitud toward help with employm nt posit 58 percent neg 15 percent difficult to answer 27 percent 2 attitud toward help with monei posit 56 percent neg 19 percent difficult to answer 25 percent 3 attitud toward help with hous posit 29 percent neg 33 percent difficult to answer 38 percent the acut of the hous problem in russia where the number of peopl wait for hous is in excess of 9 million wa clearli manifest by the fact that less than on third of those poll ar inclin to support the polici of prioriti hous alloc for forc migrant thi indic of potenti conflict rise sharpli when the ethnic composit of migrant doe not coincid with the titular ethnic group at their new place of settlement in other word mass migrat is fraught with a chain reaction of interethn conflict the symptom of which can alreadi be seen specif thei take the form of grow nation and attempt to initi pogrom against peopl of differ nation or religion in oblast which have taken in larg number of migrant there ar differ forecast about the migrat of russian to russia the number of potenti migrant could includ virtual all 25 million russian live in nearbi foreign countri some 4 5 million peopl in the next 5 10 year thi is the maximum size of the migrat flow which could be prompt either in the event of exacerb of interethn relat or as a result of the start of combat oper on the territori of former union republ accord to feder migrat servic data over the next 12 18 month we can expect between 650 000 and 1 2 million peopl to arriv in russia from nearbi foreign countri 300 000 400 000 from ukrain and belaru 250 000 550 000 from central asia and kazakhstan 40 000 100 000 from the transcaucasu and 25 000 45 000 from the baltic countri the mass migrat of russian from ukrain and belaru to russia and of ukrainian and belarusian to ukrain and belaru can happen onli in the event of militari conflict between the republ although in ukrain for exampl there ar even now forc prepar to instig thi process the situat with russian is even more complex in kazakhstan where there ar about 6 million of them on fourth of all russian live in former union republ outsid the russian feder there is a larg flow of russian migrant from kazakhstan thi trend is grow it is possibl to forecast three avenu and consequ three period of the migrat of russian to russia an activ migrat of first and second gener russian is expect from turkmenistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan azerbaijan uzbekistan and kazakhstan between 30 and 50 percent of the russian speak popul intend to emigr from there some 18 20 percent of russian intend to leav latvia estonia lithuania moldova georgia and armenia up to 11 percent of russian express desir to leav ukrain and belaru accord to poll result about 2 million russian intend to move to russia todai becaus thei feel persecut along nation and linguist line both now and in the futur the forc migrant from union republ ar mainli engin technician skill industri worker teacher and physician in other word strictli urban peopl who will be unabl to settl in the larg citi becaus of resid permit problem thei cannot bui or build hous in town becaus the law forbid it thi is why mani of them perceiv their situat as hopeless there is hardli ani need to comment on the polit view of present and futur migrant or their attitud toward the new polit and econom realiti which have turn them into outcast there ar six special and transit recept point for refuge open and function on russia s territori there is discuss of the possibl of set up similar point and region migrat servic in everi oblast the committe for migrat affair proce from the premis that thi is not onli a calam but also to a certain extent a benefit for russia the govern is begin to realiz that the recept and settlement of migrant will requir larg invest but those return to their histor motherland ar almost the most enterpris skill and industri part of the nation a public committe for the settlement of forc migrant is function in just under on year it ha process about 1 million person and ha help 20 000 but the work on migrat problem is fragment there is no coordin at state level and resourc ar be wast mani categori of migrant have found themselv altogeth outsid the sphere of state regul it is clear that the feder migrat servic will not be abl to cope with the swell flood of migrant on it own the situat call for immedi action there is need for a packag of interlink measur and coordin action by state migrat organ the foreign ministri the committe for emerg situat the state committe for nation affair and the public organ in other word there is need for a nationwid feder program for help to our compatriot furthermor thi program must be given top prioriti from the materi financi and the polit diplomat point of view alik the state s polici toward migrat need more than just seriou amend bear in mind the provision qualit and quantit apprais of migrat and it sociopolit consequ we ar talk about actual elabor a new all embrac and effect migrat polici it main action and principl would appear to be the follow help for forc migrant must includ not onli the provis of compens land credit and employ inform but also the lift of all restrict on resid permit and the choic of place of resid migrant togeth with all other russian must be given equal right to bui and sell at russia s hous and labor market and not be made hostag of suprem state interest the swell or subsid of migrat process will depend at the veri least on polit decis by the leadership of variou republ about protect the right of ethnic minor and the pace at which the indigen of the republ popul proce there must be no delai in elabor more precis guidelin in mutual relat between former ussr republ and

make much better us of the profession potenti of worker and engin from among forc migrant and refuge to organ the retrain of migrant with a view to reduc the armi of forc unemploi to encourag entrepreneuri activ by migrant temporari benefit in the taxat of small busi to form special budget and extrabudget fund for the effect resolut of these and other emerg problem the republ parliament must revisit the problem of the russian languag s statu it must be given the statu of state languag wherev it is us by the major of the popul thi approach is in line with intern norm and would obvious promot the further harmon of interst relat there also is a press need to conclud interst agreement on human right with all former union republ monitor of their fulfil could be carri out at both state and public level the statu of econom relat with variou state must depend on the observ of these intern agreement and the principl of intern law it is expedi to support the creation of trade and econom

peopl of russia ar fratern for the russian peopl our peopl desir to live in peac and friendship with the peopl of all other countri our concern about the fate of russian peopl is not aim against other peopl and state russia s path lead through peac solut of problem and mutual cooper to univers and just peac 5 problem of russia s econom mutual relat with ci countri the rate of the slump in product and inflat continu to grow in ci countri in 1993 the govern of not a singl ci republ succeed in halt the process of econom declin on the whole the total volum of industri product in the commun wa reduc by 20 percent in compar price over the year the share slump wa not affect to ani larg degre by the differ natur and pace of econom reform in differ countri in the condit of transpar border and unifi monei circul within the rubl zone the lack of coordin in econom activ hurt the financ of neighbor the imbal in reciproc deliveri ha alreadi evolv into an imbal in the intern settlement of ci countri on the whole it is possibl to agre with the opinion of world bank associ k mikhalopoulo and d tarr the situat as regard trade and payment in the former soviet republ wa distinguish by chao which reflect the exist of a seri of problem the disorgan of the credit monetari and payment system wa at the heart of these problem the main problem is that the reduct of interrepubl trade will promot the further declin of the volum of output and incom therefor polit strategist will have to creat mechan for the transit period which would help the new state to restor the effect flow of trade and avoid further seriou breach of thi flow in the short term support in the longer term the restructur of their economi and it integr in the world economi after all the sharpli increas depend of each ci state on the extern market becom a condit for the function of their economi as a matter of fact these realiti ar onli just be realiz and taken into account in the econom practic of ci countri on the whole as 1993 ha shown the step up of the economi extern depend will continu thi depend will be most graphic demonstr in the sphere of satisfi the ci countri energi need sovereign ha undermin russia s potenti as energi supplier let us add for object s sake that cutback in the rate of oil extract start four year ago accord to estim by russia s ministri of fuel and energi oil extract drop by a further 50 million tonn in 1993 in other word will reach onli 340 million tonn if thi pace of reduc the extract of black gold is maintain then in the veri near futur the fuel and energi complex will be work to meet onli russia s own need which todai stand at 240 million tonn oil export increas more than threefold but thi increas wa accompani by a reduct of deliveri to ci countri by an averag of 50 percent in thi context russia could be suspect of wage a cold war against ukrain and the baltic and central asian countri but such an approach would be base on inertia of thought fact prove whether it is advantag for russia to deliv oil product to the former republ russia deliv it output primarili raw materi which ar competit on the world market to nearbi foreign countri at price equival on averag to 30 40 percent of world price and acquir from nearbi foreign countri output at price equival to about 70 percent of world price moreov in mani instanc russia often fail to receiv ani payment at all for it export for exampl have deliv to nearbi foreign countri about 50 million tonn of oil to a total valu of 6 5 billion by wai of payment it receiv machineri and equip worth onli 700 million but russia s extern econom depend wa also increas and ha almost trebl have reach 14 15 percent of gnp thi is more than in india and japan let alon the unit state extern depend demand addit foreign currenc resourc for the economi s function natur some of the sourc ar ga oil and oil product come back to the idea of cold war against ukrain it is appropri to recal on contenti problem last year ukrain sold abroad at world price of cours 8 million tonn out of the 33 5 million tonn of oil it had receiv from russia accord to some estim the amount earn from thi deal is equal to for exampl the cost of build a major intern airport at sai novosibirsk capabl of earn an annual profit to the tune of 700 800 million russia s economi todai bear the heavi burden of addit export and import expenditur associ with transit charg for cross the territori of neighbor state but the safeti of good in transit is not guarante not even by ukrain of cours the press cite numer fact about russia s debt to other ci republ but the overal balanc is thi russia had a posit balanc of about r750 billion similar trend will also persist next year even though the govern ha taken a seri of measur to put an end to nonpay apprais the situat in russia s econom ti with nearbi foreign countri it can be said that 1993 saw the start of sober up from euphoria in the ci it is of cours prematur to conclud that the balanc of centrifug and centripet forc show that the latter ar stronger but thi awaken coupl with disappoint and lost illus ha also brought in a certain proport of common sens section v v the creation of favor intern condit for the implement of reform in russia 1 exist realiti in order to elabor russia s strategi in the sphere of nation and intern secur it is necessari to analyz the posit it occupi in the world and the essenc of it intern interest as determin by the profound chang of the last few year there ar four main factor make up the system of russia s polici guidelin at least for the 1990 s the first is the fact that the soviet union ha disintegr thu put an end to the world s bipolar structur there ha been a radic chang in the geopolit role plai by russia which ha becom a compon of the world commun russia ha inherit from the ussr 75 percent of it territori 51 percent of it popul 60 percent of fix product asset in term of valu and 76 percent of enterpris produc mean of product it account for 90 percent of oil extract 73 percent of ga extract 63 percent of electr gener 80 percent of crude oil export and almost 100 percent of natur ga export it procuc more than on half of the gnp produc in the ussr in 1990 but russia is not just smaller than the ussr in size it ha found itself in a fundament new environ to the west and to the south where the former soviet republ lie furthermor some of them have been profoundli hit by domest instabl thei ar extrem suscept to extern influenc and ar in conflict with on anoth the paradox is that formal these ar foreign countri as far as russia is concern in fact howev thei remain insepar link with it both by their common histor past and by the multitud of live econom cultur social and psycholog bond the second factor russia is experienc a most profound econom and sociopolit crisi whose solut still li far into the futur at the same time by dint of it size and of the polit and strateg legaci inherit from the ussr russia remain on of the world s lead countri it will not be at all simpl for russia to find it place in the intern arena russia s new leadership bear the burden of a difficult twin task to creat a new system of foreign and domest polici ture it into a catalyst of radic market reform and at the same time to overcom the burden of problem inherit from the past the third factor the russian feder as a genuin democrat republ russia no longer ha a plan economi but it still ha not acquir a market economi the unitari state ha collaps but the best possibl balanc between central and local power ha yet to be found furthermor the feder todai face the threat of disun and fragment into separ princip final the fourth factor is associ with chang in the surround world we ar wit the onset of a more tradit but also a much more complex time of multilater diplomaci intricaci of contradict and coincid of state interest shift coalit and limit polit goal the threat of a univers war is declin but there is a grow danger of local conflict fraught with escal of combat oper in variou region all thi indic that the mainten of peac in the futur will requir activ work by intern and region organ to ensur collect secur as well as joint peacemak action by the power proceed from what ha been said abov what ar our fatherland s main foreign polici prioriti at present russia ha three interlink suprem foreign polici prioriti the first is to ensur polit stabil in the countri prevent war and settl arm conflict on the territori of the former ussr both within and between individu republ primarili by polit mean the second is to prevent the emerg of hegemon power in europ south asia and the far east which would strive to extend their influenc to region in the former ussr where the situat is unstabl the third is to preserv the statu of a great power occupi a special posit in the world s geostrateg structur the main point for russia is to ensur polit stabil and to prevent and settl conflict across the former ussr should instabl and potenti conflict there grow further thi would threaten both russia s territori integr and it econom and democrat reform the maximum desir task is econom and polit integr on the basi of equal right voluntari and mutual advantag for ci countri primarili russia ukrain kazakhstan and belaru if the desir prove unattain then the vital import minimum task for the russian feder is to prevent the creation of a hostil coalit russia is proceed from the premis that the helsinki principl of the inviol of border must provid the foundat of mutual relat between the former ussr republ ani revis of border would be permiss onli via peac talk sanction includ the us of forc would be permiss onli in the event that a countri s leadership pursu a polici of genocid toward ethnic minor and thi is recogn and defin as genocid under un rule germani turkei japan china and other ar potenti capabl of pose the threat of region hegemoni to russia in the 1990 s of cours nobodi is accus the aforement countri of current act along thi avenu but a sober forecast of the shift balanc of forc and of the geopolit situat make it mandatori to consid the possibl of chang in their polici which ar not even contempl at present the unit state is russia s most import partner in counter region hegemoni the remain center of power ar still not capabl of realli influenc the situat in hot spot be thei in the near east angola or yugoslavia the caucasu or afghanistan russia is plan to pursu thi prioriti us differ method in differ region in europ for exampl the guarante for prevent ani militari polit expansion by lead state is perceiv in the develop of european integr and the stregnthen of the csce as an organ of collect secur and collect respons to ani potenti aggressor in the past the ussr us to advoc the simultan disband of nato and the warsaw pact organ wpo not onli ha the nato bloc not been disband but is is actual build up it might thi organ cannot be smoothli transform into a european secur structur we believ that a stabil of the situat in the russian feder on the basi of market economi and the develop of democraci will creat the need for a fundament new intern organ possibl on the basi of util and develop element from the structur of the ec the west european union nato and the csce and with particip by russia the unit state and canada the russian feder s polici in asia minor malaya aziya and south asia could take the form of direct includ militari resist to outsid interfer by agreement with the republ under threat the natur of the multipolar world adjoin the transcaucasu is much more complex russia s partner here is object iran and turkei in south asia the mainten of a certain balanc between them is in line with russia s interest despit the fact that the west would obvious give prefer to turkei as a member of nato the mainten of the us militari presenc in japan is in line with russia s interest in the far east in the event of withdraw by the unit state and of china s headlong econom and militari strengthen japan s reaction could onli take the form of acceler remilitar a clash between the two huge power over korea taiwan hong kong or southeast asia could also involv russia in the conflict ani sharp chang of the balanc of forc in favor of china or japan and the emerg of hegemon aspir in on of the two power could pose a direct threat to russia s far east it is obviou that russia need to retain it posit as a great world power thi mean russia s particip in the un secur council as on of it perman member and it role in other intern structur it also mean particip as far as possibl in the mainten of peac and the repuls of aggress includ along the line of peacemak forc within the framework of the secur council the csce and other and genocid termin oper sanction by the unit nation and region intern organ russia advoc activ prevent of the prolifer of nuclear and other mass destruct weapon a tougher regim to control the deliveri of missil and missil technolog and the elabor of agre quota and restruct on the arm trade as a whole the problem of russia s militari strateg pariti with the unit state deserv special mention it will be necessari to continu the mutual balanc reduct of russian feder and us strateg nuclear forc on new term here we need a transit from mutual deterr through the abil to deliv a crush counterstrik on the aggressor to joint manag of strateg stabil thi is why talk will constitut the sphere of special mutual relat and mutual interest between russia and the unit state 2 nation interest let us examin russia s specif nation interest from the viewpoint of intern secur retain the great power statu thi is russia s natur right vest in it thank to it econom potenti the success it ha achiev in scienc cultur militari might and so on guarante eurasian stabil whenev the eurasian balanc of forc ha been disrupt russia ha tradition been the main victim therefor the desir by ani on state or coalit of state to domin eurasia will not be in russia s fundament nation interest nor can our interest be serv by attempt to isol russia squeez it out of the black sea and the baltic sea reduc foreign econom commod turnov chang it structur and so on ensur polit and econom stabil in state all along russia s border thi is a kei interest for ani power but the problem of prevent the emerg of conflict zone along the border is especi import for russia which ha the world s longest land border and with it complex relat with neighbor which ar root in the past parri and prevent potenti threat the world in which we ar live now is a world of power partnership and power rivalri within the framework of rigid durabl structur despit the chang which have occur in the last few year especi the end of the cold war the improv of relat between the unit state and russia the rapproch to a certain extent between east and west europ and so on more sophist principl of power balanc and power collabor

further deepen of the process of disarma offer an opportun to reduc the russian arm forc to the minimum level necessari to ensur extern secur and honor the russian feder s intern commit restor the russian feder s intern prestig as the legitim heir of the former soviet union and a great power recogn by the world commun the fewer the forc be divert extern the faster will the establish of russian

and so on the most vulner sector of the russian feder s border li in the region of interethn conflict it is therefor in our nation interest to extinguish all interethn conflict along the caucasian border and achiev the restor of peac and tranquil there in todai s condit it is imposs to ensur the secur of border between ci countri without help from the arm forc from the polit viewpoint it would be disadvantag for russia to becom the first to introduc arm protect of border with ci countri it would therefor be expedi to begin with a gener accord on border regim what will be the natur of border the extent to which arm forc will particip in their protect and so on it would be expedi if the new state were to us their own forc to protect their border thi appli especi to the southern border thi section of the border ha been close in russia s interest but it is unfair for russia alon to bear the respons and cost it is in the ci state nation interest to receiv guarante against nuclear attack the likelihood of which ha to be taken into consider in todai s world the russian feder is in a posit to back up such guarante at the same time howev we ar interest in have all ci state join the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the nuclear power todai ar interest in strengthen the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon and rule out ani access to them for adventurist and irrespons politician furthermor joint action by all nuclear power in thi sphere promot the develop of relat of trust between them which is also in line with the russian feder s interest 4 threat to the preserv of state stabil and secur measur for their neutral the idea of superpow statu base upon unrestrain militar wa the primari caus of the soviet union s defeat in the cold war and it subsequ collaps the russian

is no worri origin from thi direct at present at the same time it would be prematur to rule out militari danger from the southwest in the event of ani protract of the arm conflict in yugoslavia capabl of involv neighbor countri the conflict s religi aspect is especi danger becaus we ar talk about three faith with adher in mani countri includ the russian feder romania could also produc a seat of tension or rather an outburst of romanian great power chauvin which ha not abandon the idea of re creat a greater romania incorpor moldova and the dniester region land should thi happen ani such

less like turkei such a bloc will inevit try to includ in it orbit azerbaijan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan it cannot be rule out that it might attempt to influenc kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan as well when evalu thi danger it is necessari to take into account the chang natur of mutual relat within the triangl of the russian feder the arab countri and israel the normal of the russian feder s relat with israel and the latter s susten through emigr from russia coupl with the fact that the russian feder ha to a certain extent distanc itself from libya and iraq ar provid ground for grow anti

come to abandon propaganda declar like the complet ban and withdraw of nuclear weapon and to take a realist point of view a certain quantiti of nuclear potenti is a guarante of secur both for the russian feder and the ci state in addit it is necessari to aim both now and in the forese futur for a ration regul of the balanc of the nuclear missil potenti of russia the unit state britain franc and china which remain the stabil foundat of the contemporari world order thi regul ought to be implement through deep cut of nuclear arm the strengthen of the regim of nonprolifer of mass destruct

other nuclear power includ talk on the most ration level of nuclear deterr it is also import to emphas that we ar hope for understand of our desir for real nuclear disarma by ukrain kazakhstan and

sink the countri in backward in the third world mani peopl believ that ani expect that the west and the unit state will help the reviv of a mighti and independ russia ar at best naiv the west is increasingli lose it interest in us becaus first we have lost our former econom and militari strength and second we ar no longer claim to be creat a social altern to the west at the same time as can be seen from b clinton s speech in the long term and by attract resourc for it modern from germani and japan and possibl from franc itali and britain russia could weaken competit between the western power in the econom sphere it is also worth note the question of reviv the bipolar system but on a complet new basi the idea of form a second pole is certainli not the product of abstract imagin or a specul project the shortcom and danger of the monopolar system make it necessari to consid the altern idea of a second pole the us monopoli as the sole world leader could tragic destabil intern relat by it veri natur the bipolar system offer a more stabl basi for cooper between the center of world polit it will enabl the third world countri china and russia to protect their common and individu interest in a more or less organ wai and consequ to guarante the greater effect of their effort the creation of a second pole could also strengthen militari polit stabil in the countri adjoin it and could becom an instrument for settl conflict without the west s interfer a seriou motiv for thi could be provid by the need to protect nation cultur asset to counter the expans of western mass cultur and at the same time to pool effort for the shape of competit nation cultur on the basi of the peopl own vital valu and the renew of their tradit equal collabor between all cultur could serv as a counterweight to the hegemoni of western mass cultur which is be implant final a substanti justif for form a second pole is provid by the quest for a new type of civil to replac the domin industri capitalist on whose exhaust and crisi ar increasingli obviou and univers recogn thi object could attract sympathi for the second pole among mani progress stream in the west which ar concern with the quest for a new wai of life collabor between the two center would most probabl lead to posit chang in the natur and content of the first pole s activ and give it a more realist orient even the actual discuss of the problem of creat a second pole could lead to favor albeit partial posit chang in our opinion bipolar will acceler the process of form a global system on the basi of the balanc of interest and becom a step in that direct all of mankind includ the atlant center is interest in creat the second pole becaus it offer a program for extric from the crisi be experienc by the whole world although the second pole is need partli as a counterweight to the first their relat need not be antagonist but could be built on the principl of cooper includ cooper between the unit state and russia a return to the bipolar model of the world is not the onli possibl option the multipolar system also ha it advantag in ani case it is import to ensur that thi system guarante stabil and russia occupi in it a posit befit the statu of a great power 5 disarma problem russia did not inherit ani militari polit alli from the ussr it is object unabl to maintain the mighti arm forc which the soviet union had in mani direct the paramet of russia s defens were move far beyond the limit of it state border now the countri either ha no such paramet or thei have end up be unusu close to it central region the end of the great confront between the two superpow did not lead to the triumph of the principl of nonus of forc in intern affair as proclaim by the unit nation or to the disband of militari polit allianc creat or so the explan went to parri the soviet militari threat moreov the sole remain superpow displai a notic stronger desir to impos it will wherev it feel that us interest exist includ the baltic countri there is no need to explain that if russia intend to solv it own problem guid by it own nation interest it must be strong in everi respect includ by no mean least in defens question we have the full potenti to do so thi doe not run counter to the long term peacemak guidelin proclaim by russia s presid in hi januari 1992 messag to the un secretari gener the principl of effect global and region militari polit stabil declar in thi messag also presuppos measur for mutual disarma thi is precis why russia offici took over from the ussr the baton of reduc the militari potenti of state and eas the level of intern tension it confirm the commit under intern treati and agreement to which the soviet side wa a parti and also sign in januari 1993 the russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start ii thu the track taken by russia in the sphere of the disarma process is in line with the on which the ussr follow dure the last year of it exist but the differ militari strateg condit in which russia now find itself demand of it the elabor of new concept and approach toward the solut of problem concern the arm limit and reduct nuclear disarma problem the salt i and salt ii soviet us agreement in the strateg arm limit sphere were underpin by the principl of equal and ident secur which wa agre by the side it main criterion wa the ensur of militari strateg equilibrium thi in the side opinion not onli coincid with the secur interest of the partner in the talk but also promot the stabil of the world situat but the last soviet us treati on the reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start i contain provis make it possibl to bypass thi principl if necessari the treati s shortcom includ not onli the univers known notion count of weapon which total negat the side initi proclaim intent to reduc their strateg potenti by on half but also a seri of provis place the side in unequ condit for exampl the treati impos stricter limit on land base icbm which have tradition been the foundat of the ussr and now of russia s strateg might at the same time the most liber interpret ha been appli to reduct requir for heavi bomber in which the unit state enjoi a threefold advantag there is absolut no justif for exclud from the treati s effect the strateg sea launch cruis missil which ar object more advantag for the unit state the soviet side simpli fail to obtain agreement from it partner at the talk that the abm treati should be observ while the start i treati is in forc consequ the unit state retain the possibl to chang the strateg potenti to it advantag by implement the sdi program the start i treati ha still not come into forc despit thi a new now russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens weapon start ii wa sign in januari 1993 follow compar brief talk but thi treai is not flawless suffic it to mention it provis on the procedur for the convers of icbm and submarin launch ballist missil from multipl warhead to singl warhead and the reorient of 100 us heavi bomber for the perform of nonnuclear task the start ii treati s provis potenti offer the us side an opportun to re instal more than 4 500 nuclear warhead on strateg deliveri platform within the briefest of time frame bear in mind that the total number of nuclear warhead the side mai hold after the reduct should not exce 3 000 3 500 unit russia run the risk of find itself in a situat wherebi the unit state have for some reason denounc the start ii treati could veri quickli doubl it strateg nuclear potenti under the term of the treati russia should it wish to do the same would not be abl to boost it potenti by more than 900 unit the same wai nonetheless russia ha ratifi the start i treati and ha express redi to ratifi the start ii treati with all their shortcom and posit aspect at the same time it is perfectli clear that the process of the limit and reduct of strateg arm will be continu at some stage it will be join by other nuclear power on what basi should these talk be conduct what should be their ultim goal the question of complet elimin of nuclear weapon will hardli be rais in the forese futur the other nuclear power ar not rais thi task even as an idea the agenda will evid includ the question of arriv at some maximum level for strateg nuclear arm to correspond with the so call minimum nuclear deterr back in the past the ussr express readi to support thi idea and to discuss and agre it strateg mean and basic criteria it might possibl be us to repeat thi attempt nevertheless regardless of whether thi concept will be discuss on a multilater or bilater with the unit state basi russia will have to determin what in it militari strateg posit should be meant by minimum nuclear deterr and thi should be the subsequ guid principl when elabor posit for talk on strateg nuclear arm and on nuclear arm in gener thi will help prevent ani reduct of russian nuclear forc below a certain critic limit it would not go amiss to also apprais the extent to which thi criterion correspond with the start i and start ii treati when accpt the concept of minimum nuclear deterr at the talk it is necessari to bear in mind that thi decis will inevit necessit the examin either in parallel or jointli with strateg nuclear arm of the question of tactic nuclear arm especi if thei ar deploi so as to reach target on the other side s territori includ ship base weapon as well as the uncondit observ of the abm treati limit of convent arm forc and their armament the consist process of disarma must certainli becom the normal polici of ani peacelov state in the post confront period furthermor the outbreak of interethn and other region conflict testifi that the reduct of the potenti of convent arm forc and armament is a task as import as that of reduc strateg and tactic nuclear potenti the continu of talk on convent arm forc and armament is especi topic for russia it is necessari not onli becaus it is becom increasingli difficult to man and maintain such larg arm forc but also becaus we will have to honor committ under the 1990 treati on convent arm forc in europ the parti to which wa the soviet union and not russia thi is not the same thing therefor strictli speak follow the disappear from the militari polit arena of on of the collect parti to the treati the wpo and later on of the ussr new talk ought to be held on the reduct of convent arm forc in europ and a new accord ought to be reach take into account the sharp chang in the situat in thi import region of the planet on 8 juli 1992 russia ratifi the treati under which it also commit itself to the stage by stage reduct of the numer strength of it armi and navi from 2 8 million to 2 1 million men by 1995 and to 1 5 million men by the year 2000 at the same time the nato state did not embark on ani limit and reduct of the numer strength of their arm forc and firmli refus to take naval forc on of the most import compon into account when determin the militari strateg balanc enjoi undisput superior in naval armament capabl of deliv strike against land base target carrier born aviat sea launch cruis missil nato wa unwil to lose thi imbal thi posit is most typic of the entir western approach toward talk on the limit of convent arm forc in europ it envisag the elimin of imbal but onli in those categori of armament where the wpo enjoi the advantag it is clear that ani potenti futur talk cannot leav the question of naval armament outsid the scope of agreement especi as regard armament design to strike against land base target the veri fact of the accept of commit under an accord elabor for anoth state the ussr and for differ militari strateg condit realli goe beyond the framework of ordinari common sens which indic that russia ought to accept and honor onli commit which have been thoroughli and specif elabor for the russian condit otherwis the situat mai reach the point of absurd as it did in 1993 dure the withdraw of troop from germani and the attempt to deploi them in the north caucasu militari district it emerg that russia could not do thi without breach sever provis of the treati it had ratifi it also emerg that russia cannot show ani concern for it southern flank as it see fit sinc it is constrain by limit under thi treati much ha been and is be said about the principl of suffici there is hardli a singl state in the world which would declar that the militari organiz develop of it arm forc is guid by the principl of insuffici or supersuffici therefor the term of simpl suffici is meaningless the term defens suffici or suffici for defens would be more appropri to the concept of russia s defens polici but the mean of even thi term demand thorough elabor onli when thi term ha been given specif content in line with the russian state s militari doctrin it can and must provid the basi of posit for subsequ talk on arm limit 6 the need to improv the mechan for manag militari organiz develop ani polit program of the leadership need a finetun mechan for their implement otherwis thei will remain noth but wish think in the sphere of militari work we ar still nurtur the illus that we ar talk onli of a partial reduct of the arm forc and a partial switch of the militari economi to the manufactur of nation econom output and that the actual mechan for manag militari organiz develop can remain basic the same fundament document in the defens sphere ar be implement with difficulti there is no doubt that the basic provis of the militari doctrin will creat the necessari prerequisit for the organiz develop of de facto new arm forc for russia for the reliabl protect of it interest for the elabor of long term militari technic polici for the creation and further develop of qualit new forc and for the train and educ of the personnel the militari doctrin approv by the presid basic ensur that russia will honor it intern commit on the reduct of armament and arm forc and the mainten of peac the specif applic of the militari doctrin in the sphere of the militari economi is defin in the presid s special edict no 1850 of 11 novemb 1992 wherea onli certain clarifi remark can be made as regard the doctrin s militari and militari technic aspect there ar doubt aris as regard the econom mechan thi is becaus attempt ar be made to retain the old method of manag and adapt them to the complet differ socioeconom condit now develop in russia under the former administr edict system of manag when all element of the econom organ were not onli subordin to the state but also belong to it the main mechan of manag were program and plan five year annual and so on the plan ratif wa follow by the implement of the principl that the plan is law and must be fulfil at all cost at time it wa wreck more often than not it wa fulfil but the mechan function now the situat ha chang radic complet differ law oper in the market economi even the law on defens adopt in 1992 enshrin that the state order in other word the plan issu from abov call for mandatori fulfil onli in wartim financi and econom incent should be us in peacetim the budget and the taxat system becom the main instrument of manag it is therefor anachronist for the militari doctrin in it section on militari technic and econom foundat to reli on elabor and implement of long term up to 10 15 year program for armament and militari equip on the basi of state defens order financ by the state attent must mainli be given to a comprehens substanti and balanc defens budget it is the budget that bring togeth the contradictori

mean that jordan plan to go back on the decis of disengag of ti to the west bank hi majesti the king want to make thi point veri clear we have an interest in jerusalem we want jerusalem to be arab and islam and we want the holi place to be safeguard jordan did not creat thi situat it is the natur of the declar of principl that creat thi situat becaus the declar of principl ha defer the question of jerusalem until the final phase after five year we know that when jordan relinquish the geograph jurisdict in the west bank includ jerusalem it want the palestinian to take over but if we ar go to have a vacuum for five year regard the question of jerusalem then thi mean that the holi place under isra measur and court rule will be subject to control by israel as there is no on to claim these place on behalf of the arab and muslim therefor hi majesti explain that thi posit ha to do with islam arab interest in jerusalem and is not meant to circumv the disengag decis hijjawi so there is no go back on the decis of disengag al anani there is no go back on the disengag decis there ar variou view be air which we cannot control in a countri that ha freedom of express it is better to have a constant relationship between jordan and palestin we do not want thi to be a good framework for bad intent we do not want someth that look good but induc suffer from within therefor we have to show

attempt to circumv the disengag decis if there ar fear that there will be a confeder in the futur we sai no thi howev doe not mean that there can be no confeder at the choic of the two peopl in the

legitim right to self determin on their nation soil i think hi majesti wa veri clear in thi regard hijjawi why do you think the palestinian side is drag it feet over the sign of the econom agreement with jordan al anani i do not think thei ar drag their feet it is a question of the plo want first to wrap up an agreement on isra withdraw and the gaza jericho accord befor move to deal with jordan on that score jordan howev doe not necessarili see ey to ey with the plo jordan see a greater need for arab coordin which it argu must be given preced over negoti with the isra arab jordan s argument run must coordin their polici toward israel from our standpoint we do not think an arab parti should give prefer to coordin with israel over that with fellow arab we have inform our brother that their negoti with israel ar bound to affect us directli henc the need for them to coordin with us as an import player in thi equat and at thi crucial state there can be no disregard our interest we ar press for coordin in the best interest of our two countri we ar speak from experi we should not lose sight of the import that must be attach to the right order of prioriti let us first coordin among ourselv as arab and then approach israel with a unit negoti strategi hijjawi there is a memorandum of understand and nine protocol between the jordanian and isra al anani no there ar no protocol in exist there is an agenda made up of item address particular topic there ar no protocol or annex or agreement other than the item on the joint agenda there is noth hijjawi in light of the recent event will the open of jordanian bank branch in the west bank and gaza strip be frozen al anani a decis will be made at the appropri time and i do not want to judg thing prematur we presum that the bank should be reopen in the west bank and that thi plan should pass through legal channel so jordan will endors it we ar eager to do so hijjawi have you been acquaint with what is agre on in the pari econom meet

be so i cannot tell how we will deal with them howev we can deal with such result through coordin for thi reason we call for coordin hijjawi why doe the palestinian side refrain from coordin with the jordanian side al anani it is not a matter of refrain but of interpret concern the prioriti hijjawi to what extent will the central bank of jordan control the jordanian currenc that will remain in circul in the self rule area al anani we should recal that the jordanian dinar is current avail in the west bank thank to the open bridg polici and also becaus our kinsfolk in the west bank and gaza strip prefer to deal with the jordanian dinar than with other currenc particularli the isra shekel thu the exist of bank channel will make jordan more capabl of organ the currenc affair by organ and supervis the work of such bank hijjawi what ar the possibl threat to the jordanian dinar al anani the jordanian currenc is at risk due to isra measur whether bank ar there or not we learn that immedi after the 1967 occup israel sold jordanian dinar in the market and jordan had to purchas these dinar in hard currenc moreov israel tri to counterfeit the jordanian currenc but we chang that currenc

yesterdai in the afternoon it ha drawn up a program to discuss what it is go to do the committe is now discuss the venu for the endors of the agreement jordan and the sultan of oman have been suggest

after deal with thi point the committe will move on to anoth it will name the peopl who will attend the ceremoni on arab and intern level thi will give the ceremoni more weight sinc an intern presenc repres on of the guarante for implement of thi agreement which is the outcom of immens effort made by all parti and polit forc in yemen in addit to these two task the subcommitte should studi secur arrang so the leader will be abl to go to their workplac the question of secur is veri import and the entir yemeni nation is preoccupi with it the subcommitte also ha to think about how it will go about implement the accord after it endors and how to prevent ani obstacl that could be present by the parti harm in the process al qallab do you think that some parti which sign the agreement ar try to go back on what thei have sign and ar try to procrastin al atta all the parti that sign the agreement have continu to welcom it and assert the need to implement it al qallab some arab newspap have report that hous of repres speaker shaykh abdallah bin husayn al ahmar ha some reserv about the document even though hi parti ha sign it is thi true al atta ye thi is true i have also notic that the al sahwah newspap which speak for the yemeni reform group reflect someth like thi these reserv were announc dure the draft and discuss of the document howev after consult and exchang of view it wa draft without ani reserv i have to sai here that after we draft the document and while we were still in the confer hall we notic that some paper were circul with new reserv but these reserv were not accept by the parti to the dialogu al qallab when you sai paper do you mean the letter reportedli sent by shaykh abdallah bin husayn al ahmar to the subcommitte al atta not at all the letter of shaykh abdallah came befor thi stage and wa welcom by the dialogu committe howev we notic that saba the offici yemeni new agenc did not report the fact that the dialogu committe welcom the letter when it dissemin a report about the subject al qallab the topic question on pose here and everywher is about the natur of the challeng thi document face al atta thi is not the first document that ha been sign and not been implement howev it differ from the other becaus it will bring about major chang in yemen and will set yemen on the right and sound path not onli with respect to uniti but also with respect to the establish of a modern state of institut the big challeng we face is how to get support for thi document and work togeth within a broad nation framework to implement it provis here i must point out that there ar forc which have start to work against the document and it implement in my opinon these forc will try more vicious in the futur to abort what ha been agre upon therefor we should secur yemeni popular guarante and even arab and intern guarante to foil the attempt of these forc and to have our countri take the requir step forward al qallab doe thi mean you expect some sort of action by the opposit forc to block the road to the implement of thi document al atta there is no doubt about thi that s why we propos arab and intern guarante becaus we expect militari action to harm the agreement and move in the opposit direct al qallab we heard that a plane carri foreign oil expert wa hijack two dai ago while it wa on it wai from sanaa to sirwah and that there is tension on the militari level there is thi true al atta these act ar carri out by the forc which oppos uniti these forc reveal their real face immedi follow uniti thei carri out sever action harm secur and target yemeni nation figur particularli yemeni socialist parti ysp leader and cadr and some leader of the gener peopl s congress gpc and figur from other parti in addit to thi these forc target oil compani and what happen the dai befor yesterdai is part of thi ongo seri al qallab is the issu of the plane over and have the hijack given themselv up al atta no effort ar still under wai it is known that two dai befor the hijack of thi plane anoth plane wa hijack thi remind us of the incid of the kidnap of the us diplomat as soon as he wa releas a german nation wa kidnap if you ask why these thing occur i will tell you it becaus the wai we handl those who commit such deed is wrong for exampl when a tribesman carri out a kidnap the author placat him instead of arrest him and take him to court thi encourag other to do the same thing thi is on of the point on which i have not budg as i have repeatedli reject placat kidnapp when thei commit the crime of hijack al qallab we notic that you talk about those who carri out such act as if thei were ghost you ar not give name who ar those peopl behind the kidnap explos and assassin al atta we know the name and affili of those peopl but we avoid talk about them becaus we ar do our best not to harm ani parti directli unless we ar sure you know that a person is innoc until proven guilti the problem is that some peopl ar try to obstruct the activ of the judiciari which should pass an honest imparti judgment give a more activ role to the judiciari would spare us mani problem especi concern the trade of accus between the major power for exampl a certain parti could be accus of be behind a certain incid but the court could prove it innoc and thu sedit would be prevent al qallab who is prevent the judiciari from plai it role al atta last august i address a letter to the presidenti council ask for either the arrest of those who ar carri out the explos and assassin who includ arm forc offic or sack the interior ministri command becaus it is not implement the instruct it is receiv from the prime ministri the govern could also resign the result wa that onli on person from the southern provinc wa arrest and the polic and secur agenc in the southern and eastern provinc carri out their duti while the polic in other provinc did not do anyth al qallab the ysp central committe and you ar a member of the ysp polit bureau ha made a decis on the return of some minist and senior offici to sanaa howev we see that you ar still in aden is thi a posit you have adopt al atta i am here for privat reason al qallab you were the target of an assassin attempt a while ago did you find out who wa behind the attempt al atta of the dozen of attempt that took place in sanaa over a two year period my bodyguard manag to arrest on of the culprit while he wa place a larg explos devic near my hous at the time i wa meet with my deputi had the explos occur it would realli have been a disast the strang thing is that the

incid but the report were chang after thei arriv at the ministri it wa later discov that there wa a great infiltr of the secur agenc i can sai for sure that thi appli to other attempt against sever senior offici and some nationalist figur i want to sai that if the secur question is not settl thing will get wors al qallab you have said that you ar stai here in aden for privat reason but in light of what you have just said and of the attempt on your life and after you have been prevent from enter the capit of your countri i believ that your refus to return to sanaa is a glare sign of protest is thi true al atta of cours thi is absolut true thi is becaus the continu of thi situat ha veri grave consequ for yemen it is difficult to go ahead when matter includ those concern expenditur ar decid behind the back of the prime minist al qallab we have heard that some 20 billion yemeni riyal have been counterfeit is thi true al atta first i would like to sai that there have been no case of yemeni bill be counterfeit howev there have been some case of other currenc be counterfeit al qallab can you give us exampl al atta ye there have been case of saudi riyal and us dollar be counterfeit these two currenc ar be us in yemen al qallab if the document is sign but not implement will you remain in offic with the situat that you have describ in mind al atta by god i explicitli sai that if the document is not sign or sign but not implement i cannot stai in offic al qallab in thi case if the document is not sign or sign but not implement do you not have fear for the uniti of yemen al atta thi document is the last chanc if it is not sign and implement then no on can predict the volum of the catastroph that will befal yemen henc i sai that we refus for the document to be accept onli in an attempt to abort it al qallab i heard that your parti ha decid to unilater implement the document in the area under your control even if the document is not sign al atta in practic especi concern local govern some step can be taken in thi regard al qallab in the past you the ysp were accus of be atheist and communist now you ar accus of be pro saudi and pro kuwaiti why ar these charg made al atta these ar noth but polit vituper time ha proven that these charg ar unfound at thi point i would like to sai that the ysp want good relat with the neighbor state in the arabian peninsula i also sai that despit the known circumst our stanc on the gulf crisi ha been clear al qallab will vice presid ali salim al bid return to sanaa befor the document is sign al atta never he will not

the document is a complic on and is tantamount to an initi agreement similar to the agreement between israel and the plo in the sens that everi claus requir a separ agreement it requir about 40 draft

FBIS4-22411: cso interview with nation bank vice presid merab kakulia by armaz saneblidz donetsk tbilisi econom passion a triptych for two minist and a vice presid date not given text we began our interview with nation bank vice presid merab kakulia by talk about an ordinari detail of the hullabaloo so to speak over the 50 000 rubl banknot even a priest will steal when hungri saneblidz what is the realiti behind it is it a form of make monei with monei kakulia let me sai that the hullabaloo over the 50 000 rubl banknot is pure specul thei ar the most mobil banknot in russia freeli accept by bank establish the offici of russia s central bank wouldn t even dream of take those note out of circul true counterfeit 50 000 rubl note have been print and have been found in russia and other republ where the rubl more or less circul but that shouldn t have caus such a hullabaloo becaus it s easi to determin whether a banknot is fake or not for it ha mani protect mechan for exampl just look at it in the light if you see watermark you can be sure it s genuin the finish on a fake bill is so bad that it take littl scrutini to tell the differ peopl won t accept a 50 000 rubl note in georgia and will exchang it onli if you let them keep a few thousand as a commiss so to speak make monei with monei goe on we ought to be combat thi in the media explain to peopl that a 50 000 rubl note is a fulli valid medium of payment that it is in no danger but becaus our mass conscious suffer from so much malais for variou reason it will be hard to carri out reassur work like that we do have some experi howev rememb when the exchang offic wouldn t accept dollar bill issu in the 1970s and 1980s the absurd notion of the superdollar issu in 1990 spread the ridicul claim wa that peopl in america don t like to put those bill in their pocket becaus thei contain so much metal mugger us a special devic can easili detect that kind of capit and it owner realli is in danger of lose it when thi problem surfac in georgia i ask my colleagu in the us feder reserv system although i wa certain it wa wa all made up an offici repli would be us and hi repli wa prompt and categor all banknot issu sinc 1928 ar legal tender we publish thi repli and explan and believ it or not the problem wa partli solv probabl the same thing should be done about the 50 000 rubl note saneblidz but there is still a state agenc that is suppos to regul currenc circul it ha been slow to react to thi falsehood which some organ must sure be behind why kakulia that agenc is the nation bank but keep in mind also that for us the 50 000 rubl note is foreign currenc and the nation bank doesn t have the mean to influenc it circul at best we can talk to russia s central bank and by an exchang transact have the bill exchang for smaller denomin saneblidz let me put it anoth wai some peopl think that the transact which privat exchang offic ar provid should be taken over by the state kakulia i don t share that idea until the parliament made chang to exist legisl and allow legal and physic person to open currenc exchang offic onli author bank had that right includ state bank you ll recal that most bank were not interest in bui and sell currenc thei were involv in more lucr busi such as refinanc credit resourc obtain from the nation bank bank which did engag in currenc transact onli bought it and at low rate too a black market develop in which the currenc purchas rate that form wa significantli higher than the on set by the bank and greatli exceed the purchas rate in order to correct the currenc market it becam necessari to set up an extens network of exchang offic we can sai now that the currenc black market in it tradit sens is no more the bui and sell of currenc goe on primarili in the exchang offic but a great mani of them can t meet standard although that too is be dealt with in the cours of reinforc state order still the exchang offic role would be greater if the coupon realli did function as the sole legal tender in georgia saneblidz that wa my next question parallel currenc and the fate of the coupon kakulia let s look thi wai at the idea of two currenc with parallel circul in our countri there is a gener acknowledg law of monei circul a strong currenc will drive out a weak on thi is happen befor our ey the rubl to sai noth of the dollar is drive out the coupon in everi case then offici allow parallel circul will step up the pace of coupon avoid meanwhil most of georgia s citizen receiv their pai in coupon you can imagin what will happen our peopl s earn will lose ani econom mean and lead to a social explos as for the coupon s fate is there a wai to assur it statu as the sole legal tender look here we ar in ukrain which is also have a hard time even the local karbovanet ukrainian rubl is not much firmer than our coupon there wa a time when our coupon s exchang rate wa more solid than that of the ukrainian currenc and yet the karbovanet is still the sole legal tender in all thi big countri you can hardli find a store that doe it trade with rubl or dollar if you have foreign currenc sai rubl in your hand you have to chang it at an exchang offic i repeat the karbovanet s exchang rate is fall fast yet currenc regul ar not be broken becaus that carri an appropri penalti that is enforc by law and peopl have a nation self conscious that the karbovanet is a symbol of i think that with the proper state approach we can make the coupon the sole legal tender in georgia as well i m encourag to think so by the fact the coupon s statu in the outli area is not as shaki as it is in tbilisi we have to take prompt step to save the coupon first of all we have to institut a legal mechan of liabil for violat currenc regul in georgia despit

march by 27 4 percent as compar with march of last year thi is a record declin in product dure all the year of restructur at the same time it is obviou that an improv in the economi will not occur automat there is a need for the continu and intensif of reform and their correct in a number of direct on the part of the govern and the parliament and of cours it is veri import that commerci bank be realli drawn into thi process of correct and develop in particular of the goal orient program for financi stabil todai we ar worri by a fundament question will reform develop in the economi and

thi year on the situat of the russian economi and prospect for it develop in 1994 provid for the implement of a moder tight credit and monetari polici in the current year in principl we agre with thi but it is import to determin method of realiz thi direct we do not understand the circumst that the govern credit commiss determin the alloc and distribut of central credit in a number of oblast and krai thi procedur spread and local credit commiss ar also establish there try to command bank thi is direct confirm of the return to the distribut economi and disregard for market mechan adopt ani decis concern reform bodi of state manag seem not to note the newli establish entrepreneuri sector of the economi and do not lean on their union group and associ yet it is precis here that all problem of entrepreneurship ar accumul and thei ar readi to particip in the draft of fundament document on econom develop basic direct in credit and monetari polici ar develop and decis on it ar adopt by a narrow circl of worker in the system of the rf central bank as experi show it suffer from veri import miscalcul in our opinion repres of all particip in the market economi primarili commerci bank which ar the financi and econom base for the market economi should particip in the draft of thi document we have been sai for a long time that a bank committe should be establish from among bank repres scientist and entrepreneur for now howev thi remain onli a wish reform need compet state administr and the parliament must establish the legal basi for reform as quickli as possibl inform you about the state of russia s economi and financ and analyz the condit under which commerci bank have to oper i assum that everi bank when work out the strategi of activ for the current year should take into account the econom process that ar take place not onli on the scale of activ of a specif bank but also the process that ar develop at russia s macroeconom level despit the veri complex condit under which bank have to oper the new credit system is develop and adapt to the market to an ever greater extent reform in the bank sphere outstrip transform in other econom sector as of 1 april 1994 there were 2 041 bank with 4 660 affili without the save bank in russia last year the central bank regist 306 independ bank or almost as mani as in 1992 the declar author capit of commerci bank exce 1 trillion rubl and in 1993 it increas 10 fold the amount of asset is more than 110 trillion rubl at the end of 1993 the amount of bank credit invest total 24 5 trillion rubl a total of 11 bank the author capit of which exceed 10 billion rubl appear in russia for the first time i would like to especi stress the qualit chang in bank oper undoubtedli these ar not the bank that were 4 or 5 year ago thei like spong absorb everyth that is advanc in world bank experi primarili modern bank technolog a number of bank have becom member of the swift intern settlement system have master plastic card in settlement have introduc fundament new form of bank and personnel manag on the basi of modern comput have greatli expand the rang of servic provid to client and have improv servic for the public as of 1 april of thi year the share of the popul s deposit rose to 40 percent of the total amount while in the save bank it decreas to 60 percent the figur cite abov seemingli point to a larg number of bank howev an analysi show that our economi is by no mean satur with credit institut if we exclud moscow bank and bank of two and three other larg econom center it will turn out that in the absolut major of administr region there is on bank institut per region and sometim not even thi thi will not help econom develop small and medium size busi farm and the entir entrepreneuri sector under condit of high inflat rate there is also a problem with the amount of bank ownership capit the author capit of more than two third of the total number of bank is below 500 million rubl although in the economi there should also be small bank an increas in bank liquid is connect to a consider degre with the amount of ownership capit we realiz that under condit of the shortag of fund liter in all econom sector it is not simpl to do thi nevertheless it is necessari to increas bank capit incident the campaign for sum up bank activ in 1993 indic that the absolut major of bank assign the basic amount of profit for an increas in their capit and the amount of dividend wa determin much below inflat rate howev solv the problem of increas bank capit we must take into account the real financi resourc of the economi which ar extrem meager in all it sector furthermor it is necessari to have the entir assort of bank larg medium size and small which world practic confirm the orient of the central bank onli toward larg bank is highli disput you know that as of 1 march of thi year the central bank set the minimum amount of the author capit of newli establish bank at 2 billion rubl and in 5 year thei must increas ownership capit to 5 million ecu 10 billion rubl as is now accept in the european commun under condit of the acut shortag of fund thi task is too difficult for the overwhelm number of peripher bank thi will requir 30 trillion rubl the central bank ha permit the establish of new bank with author capit rang from 500 million to 2 billion rubl for the perform of a limit rang of oper thei have no right to keep client current account and to attract fund for a period of less than 1 year client will hardli need such bank in addit to the neg consequ note abov the decis of the central bank will lead to the fact that the bulk of current oper bank will be in a difficult situat mani of them clearli realiz that thei will not be abl to increas the amount of capit to 5 million ecu within the plan period and therefor have no prospect for further develop as is well known a lack of prospect alwai is a destruct forc bank ar alreadi inform the associ of russian bank that there will not be an increas but an outflow of capit from such bank becaus sharehold ar not interest in invest fund in an unpromis busi as i have alreadi state abov the associ of russian bank undoubtedli support the direct toward an increas in the capit of bank and in their liquid howev it is advis to solv thi problem in stage depend on the financi resourc of econom region and with due regard for the sphere of bank activ as we propos last year we inform the state duma and central bank chairman v gerashchenko of our posit it is import that particip in the congress also express their opinion on thi matter i want to submit for your discuss a matter concern variou nonbank organ which have no licens attract and place fund that is perform the same function as bank do but without licens these ar financi compani fund financi and industri concern and so forth which advertis the comput of a high interest 700 to 1 000 percent and higher withdraw larg amount of the popul s fund for question oper these organ ar regist in the ministri of financ but ar not subject to supervis their deposit ar not insur peopl who deposit fund in them ar subject to risk such organ discredit the bank system befor the popul their activ doe not conform to bank legisl and often simpli swindler ar at work in them the associ of russian bank address a propos to the central bank the ministri of financ and the state tax servic to prohibit them from perform bank oper the central bank and the ministri of financ support our opinion and we hope that we will be abl to jointli solv thi problem there is anoth burn question for mani bank it is now the question of life or death in the liter sens of thi word in the current year a signific number of bank mai ceas their exist for three reason ow to the nonreturn of loan and gener insolv loss of substanti fund in oper with forg letter of advic and rossiya check and unprofit activ these ar new phenomena in russia s bank system and thei requir seriou thought it cannot be permit that the collaps of on bank should entail the bankruptci of other bank and their client for bank activ which is connect with a high risk in western countri the bankruptci of sever bank is an ordinari phenomenon howev a mechan for the prevent of bankruptci and support of bank which experi difficulti oper in all countri if a bank ha temporari difficulti with payment not through it fault it is necessari to provid for measur so that loss for other bank and especi for depositor be minim unfortun thi subject essenti ha not been studi in our countri primarili at the central bank when financi complic aris the central bank us onli on remedi depriv of licens essenti prevent and therapeut measur with a sick bank ar not taken of cours everi bank first of all should have it own reserv for the

ha collect substanti amount of monei of commerci bank in three fund in reserv account in the bankruptci insur fund and in the deposit insur fund howev dure past year thi monei ha virtual not been us for the support of bank experienc difficulti probabl thi can be attribut to the fact that an entir packag of measur concern state regul of the bank sphere ha not been form in our countri for exampl in the unit state in order to maintain current liquid commerci bank can receiv loan in the feder reserv system thi method is veri effect and prompt in order not to caus a mass withdraw of deposit from a

financi difficulti second it carri out the merg of bank which arous apprehens with bigger on third it make insur compens payment to owner of deposit through the bankruptci procedur the associ of russian bank ha persist sought the separ from the central bank of function connect with deposit insur into an independ organ in januari of thi year the central bank ha adopt the decis to stop collect of monei from bank into thi fund howev there is no deposit insur committe or corpor the associ of russian bank is prepar it propos on thi matter and we ask the state duma the govern and the central bank to take into consider the acut and import of thi problem discuss bank liquid we cannot keep silent about the qualiti of credit portfolio and the credit issu procedur we recommend that commerci bank establish strict technolog for the adopt of a decis on these matter in our opinion for thi purpos credit committe consist of highli skill and principl specialist should be set up in all bank and a specif procedur for the prepar of materi for the committe meet and person respons for their qualiti should be establish as intern and domest practic ha shown the solut of such as well as other

affect mutual relat of bank with client bank which attract medium and long term resourc with a high interest should give thought to how the decis on lower the discount rate of the central bank will

the highest wage level is in our sphere the feder council instruct the govern to provid for measur to replenish the circul capit of enterpris and to offset mutual debt the associ repeatedli address such propos to the govern and the former suprem soviet we consid it to be a posit fact that superior bodi of power have final understood thi import problem and it will find it solut at the same time the question aris why the govern repeatedli discuss the problem of nonpay did not make a decis after all to regul mutual relat in the area of the economi in fact is the function of the govern not the legisl function of the parliament at the same time the feder assembl confirm the need for an uncondit fulfil of the presid s edict date 19 octob 1993 on improv settlement in the economi and increas respons for their prompt execut as you rememb in thi edict emphasi wa place on the process by bank of promissori note of enterpris on overdu debt i would like to exchang view and to hear your propos on how to best carri out such an oper take into consider that the condit necessari for the introduct of the promissori note turnov do not yet exist in russia the central bank with our particip should work out form of settlement between enterpris and bank advanc payment or the so call prepay cannot remain the preval form thei maintain seller dictat with respect to purchas of product and lead to a vast growth of debt buyer transfer advanc lose control over their fund thei ar not left even with a document confirm the receipt of monei by supplier it is quit clear that the settlement system hamper the develop of market relat not to mention that it withdraw a vast amount of monei from the turnov the intern coordin committe for improv in russia s payment system wa establish a year go thi committe includ repres of the rf central bank of the associ of russian bank and of a number of commerci bank as well as of such intern organ as the intern monetari fund the world bank the commiss of the

the develop of new financi tool includ promissori note and for the train and educ of personnel in the field of settlement and informat have been develop within the framework of thi committe by now it is onli necessari to speed up the realiz of these propos the associ of russian bank will inform their member as work at the indic section is complet the organ of mutual econom relat and determin of optimum form of mutual interst settlement at the level of both central and commerci bank is a vital import problem which politician and manag of bank system in near abroad must solv life forc commerci bank to search for method of settlement essenti blindli the chief thing is that it is not clear along what path to build the system of mutual settlement to complet give up the idea of the rubl zone of the new type and to give prefer to payment in nation currenc or to find other variant combin both in order to discuss thi entir set of problem the associ of russian bank togeth with the central bank of russia and the intern econom save bank plan to hold a bank confer possibl wai of form a system of mutual settlement with state in near abroad the poor state of account is on of the unsolv problem in bank thi is connect not onli with the shortag of skill account personnel but also with the obsolet account plan and the absenc of an effici norm base and of methodolog support for the financi report of bank at the end of last year commerci bank as an experi began to draw up new financi report and new account standard howev there ar no new norm document conform to new bank legisl the account plan and account and report rule approv in 1987 have becom obsolet moreov thei come into conflict with a number of law in particular with the fundament of civil legisl with the law on ownership in the russian feder and with the law on bank and bank activ in our opinion the account of commerci bank should gradual approach intern standard thi mean that account should be reliabl and ensur a real evalu of the result of activ and of the asset and liabil of bank and the safeti of the bank document turnov in accord with exist legisl the methodolog of account is determin by the central bank but it effort in thi obvious ar insuffici we realiz that the central bank ha difficulti in connect with the departur of skill personnel and we ar readi to appeal to bank to establish a group from among specialist of commerci bank for the prepar of the necessari document sinc the begin of reform invest have drop by more than 50 percent undoubtedli the declin in product chang in form of ownership and especi inflat have affect thi ow to thi bank particip in invest approxim at the rate of 4 percent of all the credit invest on 21 march of thi year the rf govern approv the temporari statut on financ and credit capit construct we welcom such a step by the govern howev it concern onli state enterpris therefor the distribut principl prevail in it in our opinion a system for grant credit for these purpos on the basi of an arrang between client and commerci bank with state support by mean of interest on credit so that enterpris mai receiv loan as now at an annual interest of 13 percent would be an effect measur in our opinion the govern ha not taken advantag of all the opportun to attract fund for invest the associ of russian bank ha analyz wai of reviv invest process from thi standpoint and address a special note to govern chairman vs chernomyrdin for bank that put monei in invest it is necessari to lower obligatori reserv to make tax polici more favor to set apart the keep of fund earmark for these purpos and so forth unfortun our propos have not yet found a real wai out in our opinion it is necessari to onc again return to thi matter take into consider that the invest capac in russia s economi make up 15 to 20 trillion rubl while capit invest now total approxim 7 0 trillion rubl the associ attent examin the plan for the possibl direct of invest prepar by the rf ministri of econom in our opinion the polici of big invest project with a recoveri of 5 to 12 year which prevail in these program will intensifi inflat therefor it doe not correspond to the possibl and tactic of implement of invest in our opinion thi plan first of all should contain project primarili connect with an increas in consum good process of agricultur product and product of equip for small and medium size busi thi will make it possibl to realiz them more rapidli and to increas the mass of commod and nation incom which will activ promot a reduct in inflat rate such project will acceler the return of fund put in invest program there is anoth sourc of invest but it is of the natur of polit decis make unfortun russian monei circul all over the world and on should not be surpris at thi the experi of other countri indic that when in a countri there is a high level of inflat extrem high interest rate and unstabl legisl and intern polit situat there is an outflow of capit fear of the possibl of regular confisc from russian entrepreneur should be ad to thi thi is a fulli understand matter therefor on should hardli be surpris that the currenc earn by our entrepreneur disappear from the countri if the polit and econom situat and legisl in russia had been more stabl undoubtedli these dollar would have work for our economi that is the effect of invest in russia s economi is veri high accord to variou evalu the amount of these fund in foreign bank rang from 20 to 40 billion dollar in order to return thi vast amount of monei russia s author should examin the method of guarante owner of capit it safeti thi path is more prefer to wait to receiv dollar credit from intern financi organ in our opinion a joint statement by the presid the feder assembl and the govern on guarante to entrepreneur return capit to the countri could be on of such measur the feder assembl should adopt law on such guarante it would not be superflu to back such guarante with our state s intern oblig the econom situat also dictat an energet decis possibl by involv commerci bank or their lead group in the problem of settlement of the countri s foreign debt to the london club no

first confront of thi type that ha happen within the framework of the unifi nation although the mobil forc particip on each side ar evid of the degre of fragil of the institut that repres the structur of the state and the likelihood that thi state ha no futur if matter continu to be as thei ar right now 2 the confront is occur dure the time when a newli appoint governor is assum hi duti of offic thi governor is muhammad ali ahmad on of the top men of ali nasir muhammad the former presid of south yemen the fight is happen in the midst of a disput concern the legal of appoint him by mean of a decis made by the prime minist as a prelud to have the presidenti council later on issu a decre appoint him to thi posit some peopl especi those in the ysp sai that the fight began in order to prevent him from arriv in the governor to assum the duti of hi offic 3 the fight ha happen in a governor that sinc the event of 13 januari 1986 that put an end to the rule of ali nasir ha maintain it stanc of silent opposit to rule by the ysp in it present form in south yemen and the situat remain the same even after unif becaus the ysp continu to have it influenc in the south from the strateg point of view of the northern forc it wa consid to be an import event in the seri of effort aim at crush the attempt to reviv the southern regim in aden becaus domin the governor of abyan would furnish the miss link in the seri of militari posit necessari to encircl the unifi nation s econom and busi capit from the east thi would make it easi to isol the governor of aden and lahij in the west from the governor of shabwah hadramawt and al mahrah in the east where the sourc of petroleum wealth ar a relat issu here is the fact that thi confront from the point of view of the north had the object of prevent a reconcili between the wing of the ysp that is current part of the power structur in the unifi state and the wing that split off with ali nasir dure the event of januari 1986 the popular base of which is consid to be abyan and pictur the battl as be fought between the nativ of abyan who support the northern forc the al amaliqah giant brigad against the southern ysp forc which includ the ysp militia format known as the madram brigad and the 5th armor brigad which came from aden to support it on thing that help to highlight the idea of thi old feel of reveng and the attempt to us thi opportun to exploit it is the fact that the al wahdah uniti brigad which particip in the fight after be transfer from hadramawt to abyan wa the unit that after the event dure januari of 1986 restor the situat in the governor so that it would favor the wing of the ysp that is current in power both local and northern element accus it of have commit horribl atroc as it undertook it task 4 the fourth factor is the particip of some of the arab afghan who ar headquart in the al maraqishah mountain report sai that an estim three brigad of soldier from the yemeni reform group yrg militia also particip in the skirmish in civilian cloth togeth with the southern forc in an attempt to portrai the confront as be on between civilian who ar nativ of the governor and remnant of the former

that it is danger to reli on extremist militia which ar not known for be disciplin to decid a polit struggl be wage within the framework of the state thei point out egypt s experi in thi regard when presid anwar sadat encourag a trend such as thi on in order to contain nasirit and marxist element not onli did thi effort end with him be assassin by them the result wa also an aggrav of the problem

wound wherea politician from the variou yemeni polit faction maintain that no more than six person were kill and a few dozen were injur becaus the skirmish were within the framework of yemeni tradit which follow the practic of fire into the air the fact remain that thei constitut a step on the rocki road toward uniti there ar apprehens that thei mai lead to a relaps or end up be a case of flee
