that the precondit for success increas thi appli to both the develop and the distribut phase for develop of larg system cooper with the custom is a prerequisit for success 8 energi technolog is mark by high invest cost long lifetim and high demand for access of the system thi lead to a certain inertia toward radic chang and these take longer than in mani other field the swedish develop of energi

other area of technolog such as the field of nuclear technolog 10 the develop usual took place in the form of develop block in which technolog develop and technolog buyer cooper under busi like form and with a distinct intern alloc of role 11 the swedish develop of energi technolog appear uniqu from an intern perspect the develop wa facilit by rapid market growth which made it easier to spread the technolog by success share of risk between variou player by a stabl surround world and particularli dure the post war era by a favor financi situat 12 todai the develop of energi technolog in mani wai face a more difficult situat the greater pace of chang in the rest of the world ha led to higher concentr on short term issu the growth in energi us ha decreas and the capit cost have increas on the other hand the more intens competit lead to more pressur on the compani to us their resourc in the most effici wai and the internation financi market make financ of larg project easier factor which stimul technic develop 13 within the power sector there is no longer ani specif swedish develop of energi technolog as a result of grow develop cost and reduc swedish invest volum the develop cost must be spread over a larger market volum than the swedish on 14 within the heat sector a swedish develop cours ha a somewhat greater import as a result of a larger domest market special need by the custom and often lower develop cost in thi field as well there is a grow internation and here as well it is becom less import to talk about a swedish develop cours 15 the deregul and internation of the energi market is put the energi compani on a more equal foot with other industri activ thi could possibl primarili dure the adjust phase lead to a certain reduc interest in share develop risk just as for other capit intens process industri howev competit advantag ar to a major degre creat by forward look invest in new technolog which is why the princip orient will remain societi s influenc

of control aim at the technolog develop or technolog applic here call innov support in all the climat for technic develop ha much greater signific for the technic renew 17 the long rang stabil in govern regul the interest rate level and the taxat and fee polici ar three area of particular import for the climat of technic develop in the energi field it is further essenti which doe not distinguish the energi field from other field of technolog that there is a great deal of expertis in basic research and educ and an econom polici which stimul industri activ 18 innov support for compani ha been given in three form regul financi mean of control and inform regul have been the tradit method to reduc the environment consequ of technolog applic in some case tax and other fee have

contribut for develop project have possibl in some case acceler an ongo develop process in all howev thi support ha not had ani appreci effect neither posit nor neg on the activ of the compani 20 tax and fee as well as regul have in gener had much greater effect but not alwai of the kind intend 21 there ar three main type of princip difficulti involv social support for the develop of energi

have rapidli spread between the energi compani the market which is under wai could lead to a slower distribut of result and to more parallel work among enterpris thi should be oppos by reinforc joint industri research 23 histor the energi compani and particularli the player in the technolog triangl have been mark by a willing to take technic risk when thi wa in line with the compani strateg consider in principl thi still appli the sector is character by larg compani with good opportun for financ r d effort there is therefor no reason to assum that the energi compani in gener ar underinvest in r d 24 steer the us of technolog toward increasingli environment adapt technolog is an essenti social task for that reason it is import that the environment cost aspect is incorpor into the think regul have often been more effect than environment fee which is like to be due mostli to the fee have been exploit as an opportun for taxat these effort must be credibl stabl and as far as possibl undertaken in intern cooper 1 content and organ thi studi analyz how societi should act in order to stimul commerci develop of energi technolog by commerci technic develop is meant develop which from a shorter or longer perspect is aim at method product or process us in the market in chapter 2 the technic develop process the forc behind it and the factor for success ar analyz the object is to answer the question what determin the success for technic develop project and new technolog and to what extent is energi technolog and the develop of energi technolog differ from other technolog develop technic develop is also affect by factor of the surround world such as the compani histor decis market develop competitor action etc in chapter 3 the question is therefor ask what ha govern the orient of energi technolog develop and what ar the effect of the structur and organ of the energi sector on thi technic develop also discuss in the chapter ar ongo and anticip chang and their possibl impact on the futur develop of energi technolog chapter 4 discuss societi s role in the develop of energi technolog and the histor experi from govern measur in sweden and abroad the main question is to what extent and in which wai societi can influenc the develop of energi technolog and what the experi of these measur ar in chapter 5 in conclus propos ar state for the wai societi can stimul commerci develop of energi technolog the organ of the studi is shown by the figur below not includ in addit to the work group s own experi and evalu the studi is base on three specialist seminar with about 15 invit theoretician and practition the seminar dealt with the issu discuss in chapter 2 3 and 4 respect for each of these seminar a foundat report wa work out as support materi the report from the first and third seminar respect ar given in supplement 1 and 2 to thi partial studi while the foundat for the second seminar form it own report af 1991 2 what character success energi technolog in thi chapter will be discuss futur factor of success for technic develop project factor which affect the speed of distribut for a new technolog as well as what distinguish develop of energi technolog from other technic develop 2 1 what character success technic develop project by technic develop project is meant the entir process from idea to commerci product by wai of r d product develop product adapt etc a success project is a project which lead to a product that sooner or later will gener profit technic develop is usual divid into basic research appli research product demonstr and the distribut of the technolog in the market on often talk about the so call develop chain the goal of basic research is intern scientif theori format and basic research ha an intrins valu while other r d activ in the shorter or longer term ar aim at produc method product or product process it is often taken for grant that all the phase in the develop chain must be pass through for technic develop thi is not the case research is not a necessari first step for product develop not even product develop is alwai necessari for technic develop learn effect which lead to technic develop also occur in connect with undertak other work the last step introduc the technolog to the market howev is a condit for the technolog have an impact on societi and thu lead to technic develop in the actual sens thu success product develop must lead to market test product and process from which the technolog develop as well as the buyer make monei the orient toward result in product develop lead to a differ in how research and develop work in commerci develop work the effort is rapidli and effect to achiev result it mai be said that research strive to talk about how someth work in product develop it is enough to know that it work without for that reason have complet knowledg of why it happen thi wai if difficulti occur in product develop there ar two possibl go around the problem or compromis the perform characterist of the product mani eleg technic solut involv precis go around the difficulti a good exampl of thi from the case studi see supplement 1 is the hvdc high voltag direct current case in which on actual never succeed in solv the problem of the backfir of the ga fill rectifi but it wa still possibl to us them as rectifi by creat enough redund it is not veri common that on succe by do so of cours most usual is that on is forc to compromis with the perform of the product often it also turn out that in a certain phase it is not enough to know that the product work but on ha to know the physic foundat in greater detail in order to continu thi requir research and mean that the cours of develop come to a halt while wait for these find in principl develop project can be divid into develop of new gener of exist product and genuin new develop product of strateg import for the futur a gener chang is aim at retain posit in the marketplac and is the compani s wai of increas competit strength and profit in the short run often it turn out that by chang gener it is possibl to reduc manufactur cost or increas perform by up to 20 percent new develop project mean strateg invest for the futur and it take time befor these invest becom profit in the meantim it is necessari for establish product to gener profit cash cow which can be us for the new develop consequ both type of project must exist simultan and a success compani thu work for both the long term and the short term at the same time the follow section deal mainli with new develop project although part of the reason can be appli to gener chang project financi volum and develop time vari greatli between variou project product field and type of technolog in the energi sector as in other sector of infrastructur charact the develop is domin by larg project and facil with long technic and econom life the develop cost for new technolog ar difficult to indic precis figur often includ a great deal more than direct develop cost and must alwai be treat with caution the type of develop process which ar describ in supplement 1 howev often involv direct develop cost in the rang of sever hundr million kronor and up usual follow by even higher cost for the first refer facil figur 2 1 not includ show the time from idea to commerci product for 45 import innov in sweden dure the postwar era as can be seen in the figur the time vari greatli around an averag number of about eight year energi innov ar among the area mark by long develop time henc it is not unusu to have develop time of more than 10 year distribut the technolog in the market also proce rel slowli and perhap for that reason it take anoth approxim 10 year befor the product ha paid off it develop cost such develop cours natur pose major demand for long term involv and financi stamina by the compani and accordingli requir financi strong busi sinc the ultim evalu of whether the project wa actual success or not often cannot be undertaken until close to 20 year after the project idea it is necessari when start a develop project to be assur that in the futur the project will lead to financi and competit advantag for the compani the combin of high cost and long time frame have the result that the futur profit of the project must be veri high cover the cost of the project is therefor not enough of an incent for the compani to put it best develop resourc into a project the product develop process can be divid into two phase the search phase in which a rather free search of altern method is made in order to solv problem and the product specif develop in all the search phase can consum up to 10 percent of the total develop resourc after that the develop project itself end the success factor sup 1 for a technic develop project ar mani and the interplai between them is not alwai simpl often it turn out howev that success technic develop project ar mark by a chain of success consist of earli evalu and high qualiti assess which lead to a clear and earli pictur of the market and the product s properti which lead to a strong product which lead to good market penetr on usual talk about protocol in the develop work with the protocol concept the entir develop work is aim correctli from the begin and thi usual lead to a strong product all project alwai includ knowledg from outsid in figur 2 2 not includ is shown a typolog of variou such method for acquir idea and knowledg it is thu not possibl necessari or desir alwai to gener all knowledg oneself mani insist that swedish compani and sweden on the whole have been particularli success as regard acquir knowledg from the surround world and convert it into new product and process of their own someth which is particularli import for a small countri the kei to a success develop project is therefor to make the correct evalu immedi in the initi phase in order to do so it is necessari to have a good and earli product and system specif which properli point out what market there is or can be expect and how to deal with it the basic question is when and how will the product be competit on those occas when the problem descript or problem definit wa lack wa insuffici or even wrong the project usual fail the most common reason for such failur is that the market connect ha been too weak experi from similar product develop work provid better opportun of cours the precondit for success evalu increas if on ha good knowledg of the custom of hi need a gener accept truth is that new custom new market ar more difficult than new product new technolog and the combin of new product and new custom is close to hopelessli difficult thi is becaus coupl the develop to the market becom consider more difficult in thi case well develop cooper with the custom with a knowledg potenti custom automat lead to be abl to enter market aspect into the develop work and thu to be abl to posit the develop work correctli from the begin and increas the opportun for a good product at the same time as we earlier conclud that it is essenti to have suffici resourc for develop work it is often not an advantag to have too mani resourc particularli not in the initi phase of develop project thi could lead to becom careless with identifi the goal of the develop work which mean that the develop project is less well posit and therefor lead to a poorer result onc the search phase is conclud and the develop project itself start it is often a major advantag to have larg resourc particularli for product with short product live the product must be quickli develop thi is facilit by be abl to pursu the develop with parallel develop path someth which requir major resourc as wa state abov success develop project ar often mark by close cooper between the develop of the technolog and an earli potenti custom in sever of the case studi in supplement 1 it is strike that there wa consider willing to take risk by someon or both parti in the develop work even in veri larg develop project thi willing to take risk can often be trace to some person or a small group of person in lead posit without these entrepreneur or fieri soul technic innov do not proce it is essenti to note which can also be seen in the case studi that the entrepreneur doe not intrins need to be directli involv in the develop work but can veri well be an earli custom the incent for the entrepreneur is usual the hope for financi profit of cours and for that reason it is import for tax regul etc to be design in such a wai that the entrepreneur ha a clear financi incent 2 2 spread new technolog in the market on proven experi is that sweden ha been success not onli in gather r d experi from the rest of the world but also regard rapid spread of technolog thi appli to the energi sector as well the factor which affect the success of a technolog in the market natur depend to a larg extent on what lead to a success develop project well develop earli cooper with the custom appear to be the most import individu factor in thi case as well thi mean that mani difficulti ar automat avoid at the same time the lack of such earli custom cooper mean that so mani difficulti accumul that the product will scarc succe in the market new technolog is often introduc in connect with new invest if new technolog is to achiev good distribut it must therefor be avail when the custom group ha a need for new invest thi is particularli import for technolog that cannot be appli to exist facil which is often the case for process technolog in a grow market capac must be expand while with zero growth new invest need onli to be undertaken at the rate old facil ar taken out of oper that make spread new technolog much more rapid dure strong market growth the fact that nuclear power wa abl to achiev such rapid distribut in the swedish energi system wa made easier for exampl becaus the penetr took place in a market under rapid growth correspondingli a strong structur reorgan lead to major opportun for new technolog the rapid distribut process which ar provid in the case descript for the tmp thermo mechan pulp process and the steel develop in supplement 1 should at least in part be seen in the light of the rapid structur chang which occur within these industri at the same time these two sampl case also show that even in capit intens matur industri new technolog can spread remark quickli if suitabl condit prevail if invest willing is low the speed of distribut for new technolog is usual slow thi will be the case dure slow market growth for exampl thi slow distribut is particularli strike in connect with a transit from a growth situat to a non growth situat when for a period replac invest will be particularli small as a result of a rel modern physic plant structur the most import individu properti for the market penetr of the product given that a need for the product exist is the advantag offer by the product rel to previou product sinc busi activ impos demand for measur the improv at least as regard produc good must be financi or technic measur in the form of improv product perform or lower cost thu it is not enough for the product to be perceiv as better the cours of the distribut is also affect by the product s compat with exist norm standard and technic environ market penetr take longer for technolog which doe not fit exist system technic or organization or which by be radic differ or complex ar perceiv as foreign by the custom the opportun to test the technolog on a reason scale also affect the cours of the distribut technolog involv technic risk which must be taken in facil which ar felt to be larg by those involv have greater difficulti than where the technic risk ha been dealt with in a compar small pilot facil on factor which in the case studi appear import for spread the technolog is the refer facil veri high demand for access of the product ar often place on process technolog at the same time new invest ha consequ far into the futur the result of thi is that a buyer of such technolog feel healthi caution toward untest technic solut it is therefor essenti for distribut to build an initi moder larg refer facil on a commerci basi bought by a respect custom known for be a good purchas such a facil is import for the continu technic evalu but still more import for make commerci evalu easier for new custom a demonstr facil not built on a commerci basi is of limit valu howev although it could possibl show that the technolog work it doe not facilit the custom commerci assess in the same wai 2 3 distinguish factor for develop energi technolog the factor of success in the previou section ar mainli gener independ of the technic field in thi section is discuss to what extent the develop of energi technolog differ from other technic develop after that the characterist for cabl transmit energi technolog and the special consequ for those develop pattern ar discuss thi is becaus the develop of energi technolog in sweden to a larg extent involv cabl transmit technolog and technic compon or system which oper within the framework of cabl grid what character the develop of energi technolog energi technolog ha mani similar with other process industri it requir larg initi invest it lead to strong relationship of depend between the energi supplier and the energi user it pose special demand for care product plan sinc the maximum product capac is greatli limit and it pose particularli great demand on access in the system all in all thi result in the energi system have a consider built in inertia against technic chang radic chang of the architectur of the energi system is a process which rang of sever decad while such a develop in some other field can be consider faster the develop time for produc new technolog and process ar also compar long which further reinforc the long perspect in energi technolog develop the special market structur with a few equip manufactur and energi supplier is to some extent a result of the chosen technolog onli strong compani with consider financi stamina and extens technic know how can cope with larg long term project of high technic complex and larg financi scope thi structur in turn ha creat special precondit for long rang close cooper the custom have known that there were supplier compani with a great deal of abil to satisfi their wish at the same time the supplier compani have met strong custom often with stabl social support who have been abl to risk a fail project without too much problem the energi compani between themselv have also been mark by a strike open which is facilit of cours by the fact that there wa no competit situat histor the develop of energi technolog is therefor character by have been conduct in an unusu cooper environ and by market relat of a particularli last natur someth which distinguish the energi field from sever other field with correspondingli high proport of capit cost such as the telecommun field is that the develop of the oper cost in thi case the develop of fuel cost ha turn out to be of decis import for the profit of the invest thi is due to the veri larg fluctuat in raw materi price and tax of cours the energi field also differ becaus both technolog and market question have been affect by polit decis to a greater extent than in other area of technolog thi is true both in sweden and in sever other countri it is also connect with the fact that societi ha quit favor opportun for influenc the develop becaus of the close involv of the energi sector with environment and resourc issu and becaus societi in sever countri ha been directli involv as owner in on or more of the energi compani as well as the import of thi for the social develop the effect of cabl transmit technolog on develop pattern a cabl transmit energi system pose particularli high demand on the develop in a number of respect a cabl transmit system creat an even stronger depend between supplier and custom the custom ha becom depend on an energi suppli link and cannot easili chang supplier if he is not satisfi the supplier is also greatli depend on hi custom sinc the invest made cannot be chang with eas the custom ar not quit as depend on just on supplier but can chang to someon els if the cooper is not work the supplier can also chang the circl of custom dure the lifetim of the invest sinc the invest in a cabl grid ha a veri long life and ha the charact of a sunk cost when it is complet it ha impact far into the futur the invest will thu affect the futur scope of action in a cabl transmit system it is not onli on the product side that it is veri import to have even util it is just as import for util in the distribut system to be even partli becaus the larg amount of capit invest should be effici util and partli becaus the maximum transmiss capabl is more limit than in a non cabl conduct system after all there ar ordinarili no possibl of emploi extra transmiss capac as in the case of a non cabl transmit system furthermor there is usual not ani storag possibl correspond to the on in non cabl transmit system product must take place at the same time as consumpt which is in some contrast to the effort for even util of the system and make optim extra difficult thi lead to cabl transmit energi system be mark by particularli larg advantag of scale by build larg system and coupl togeth product unit and user with differ characterist it is possibl to achiev the desir balanc at the same time as variat on both the product and the util side can be dealt with in sum the factor mention abov have the effect that the energi technolog which is part of cabl transmit distribut system oper under special develop circumst at the same time it must be state that there ar differ in degre between cabl transmit system which ar due to the fundament architectur of the system in thi case it is possibl to distinguish between cabl transmit system on the on hand which ar first establish local in order later to be coupl into an integr grid and on the other hand entir new structur which can be directli combin into an integr grid a system which is built local and then integr involv fewer initi invest but often in the long run poorer develop possibl than a system establish from the begin 3 the technic develop within the energi industri the follow chapter analyz develop pattern for the swedish energi system after a brief descript of the power and heat industri and it suppli industri and it structur in section 3 2 we will discuss develop pattern for the swedish energi system and the develop of the swedish energi technolog in the conclud section we will analyz certain current develop pattern as well as import futur question for the develop of energi technolog 3 1 the structur of the energi industri an energi system includ three princip type of player energi supplier energi user and equip manufactur who deliv technic equip to supplier and user while the energi supplier and equip manufactur ar clearli identifi group the energi user ar a heterogen crowd which includ everyth from veri larg custom such as a steel mill down to privat person in the follow descript interest is focus partli on the suppli industri and equip manufactur and partli on the heat and electr power industri produc of power and heat mean the power compani and the municip power plant in 1990 had a turnov of about 65 billion kronor and emploi about 20 000 person af 1991 thi is somewhat less than the pulp and paper industri 73 billion kronor and automobil industri 77 billion kronor but is for exampl more than three time more than the turnov in the telecommun industri 23 billion kronor and seven time more than the pharmaceut industri 9 3 billion kronor judg by the number of employe the automobil industri is nearli three time larger the pulp and paper industri twice as larg and the telecommun industri approxim the same size as the power and heat industri the pharmaceut industri ha about on third as mani employe the turnov per employe is therefor more than twice as high among power and heat produc as in the alreadi veri capit intens pulp and paper industri and nearli four time higher than in the telecommun industri a distinct featur of the energi industri is thu an almost extrem high capit intens of the swedish power product capac vattenfal own 50 percent the industri 25 percent the municip 19 percent and other six percent appli to 1991 in comparison with other countri the ownership of the electr power product is well balanc between govern municip and privat interest the power industri and of cours the municip power plant as well have tradition been of an almost total nation charact with a low degre of internation tradition there also ha never been ani extens foreign ownership interest a certain internation and greater intern ownership ha taken place in the last few year the obstacl to enter the industri ar high tradition legisl and concess have in mani case made start new busi imposs although thi is not the case the opportun for new establish ar compar small as a result of the veri larg invest requir in mani area there ar about 300 compani which distribut electr power in the countri the 10 largest power distributor have 37 percent of sweden s total subscrib the largest distributor ar sydkraft stockholm energi vattenfal and goteborg energi dure the period 1970 1990 power consumpt more than doubl in sweden from 63 twh year to 140 twh year includ transmiss loss thi mean an averag rate of increas of more than 4 percent per year distribut over the period the increas from 1970 to 1975 wa a total of 26 percent 1975 1980 a total of 18 percent 1980 1985 a total of 39 percent and 1985 1990 a total of seven percent at present the growth is lower just as the electr power industri the district heat industri can be divid into a product segment and a distribut segment in most case a vertic integr exist between produc and distributor which is why that divis is not as obviou district heat is deliv from hot water center and thermal power plant characterist of the industri is that there is major variat in size the 10 largest plant ar respons for about 50 percent of the district heat deliveri the 100 smallest plant about two third of the number of plant onli repres about 15 percent the typic owner of a district heat grid and product facil is a municip or a municip own corpor the largest supplier of district heat in sweden ar stockholm energi goteborg energi malmo energi vastera tekniska verken and uppsala energi district heat wa expand quit rapidli dure the 1970 s and the first half of the 1980 s no signific market growth can be foreseen at present outsid the larger citi sinc most area suitabl for district heat grid have alreadi been util sever swedish compani in the heavi mechan engin and electr engin industri have establish their strength on the basi of deliv equip to energi facil the domin compani particularli in electr engin ha of cours been asea abb abb compani oper in sweden ar big on light water reactor steam turbin gener high voltag transmiss equip switch gear transform electr motor control equip stack ga purif equip in order just to mention some of the most import product field for deliveri of larg energi product compon such as furnac or turbin there ar onli a few supplier in sweden when it come to tradit steam boiler for power plant there ar no longer ani manufactur under swedish ownership in sweden supplier for the swedish market ar among other abb aeg ahlstrom kvaerner and siemen for smaller equip detail within the energi industri such as transform switch equip valv pump etc there ar sever supplier of whom a few foreign on such as siemen also have a small product in sweden 3 2 what character the swedish develop of energi technolog the develop of energi technolog in sweden in sever respect equal the technic develop in the electr power sector by that is not meant that the develop ha sole involv electr engin but that the develop wa undertaken with a view toward the need of the electr sector thi emphasi can be trace to the establish of the energi system and to the composit of swedish industri for a long time swedish industri develop wa mostli equival to the develop of basic industri the princip task of the energi sector becam to suppli thi trade of such vital import to sweden with suffici quantiti of suffici cheap energi gradual a consider mechan engin industri also appear which to be sure did not requir larg amount of energi but nevertheless depend on an assur suppli primarili of electr power guarante deliveri of suffici amount of electr power at competit price thu quickli becam a condit for the abil of the initi strongli export orient swedish industri to compet thi requir a strong power industri at the begin of the centuri the suppli and us of electr wa local with increas demand greater capac wa need the power industri realiz at an earli stage that the special swedish situat with major natur resourc locat in complet differ place than the consumpt center would be abl to provid uniqu opportun for solv the electr power suppli in a ration and cost effect wai there wa talk dure thi period of the white coal that is to sai hydroelectr power and how it could be util the technolog to do so wa not avail howev the power need for develop creat expans opportun for the swedish electr engin industri head by asea thi develop provid basic technic know how and player relationship which could be us as a foundat when the expans of hydroelectr power wa complet and other technic system were need to meet the constantli grow need for electr the establish of the nuclear power industri abov all is an exampl of thi the typic pattern for the develop of the swedish energi technolog ha therefor been that technolog wa develop in order to meet need within the swedish energi system these product and the knowledg and expertis which have accumul in the track of thi develop have then in sever case becom internation success product some outstand exampl of thi ar for exampl asea high voltag transmiss equip for altern current as well as for direct current turbin primarili from asea stal and asea atom nuclear reactor on mai speak about there be a technolog triangl between asea abb and the power compani primarili sydkraft and vattenfal and the electr intens industri chiefli the pulp and paper industri and the iron and steel industri it is in the interfac between these industri that develop need and technic know how have been found so that meaning develop cooper could be establish larg project which involv long term commit and have long repay period pose major demand on care coordin the result of thi is that technolog develop is made easier by a guarantor who assur the long rang involv of the parti sever of the develop project ar mark by the exist of such a guarantor the relationship ar explain by the figur below not includ the develop ha often assum the charact of develop cooper and ha often taken place under businesslik form in which the role of the variou player were clear and express the fact that precis swedish player cooper therefor is not due to ani forc swedish protection but to the fact that it wa actual more ration there ar sever exampl of thi type of develop cooper in sweden even outsid the field of energi sup 2 and dahmen ha coin the express develop block to describ similar process in hi studi of the swedish industri develop dure the period between the war dahmen 1950 in certain case these develop block consist directli of cooper between a coupl of compani the cooper between asea and vattenfal regard high voltag technolog repres such an exampl an import and well known exampl in which a guarantor facilit the develop is stockholm enskilda bank s activ at the begin of the centuri when the bank through favor credit facilit the expans of hydroelectr power and greatli particip in establish asea as a compani gassland 1956 nuclear power repres a clear exampl of a develop block in which close cooper between sever player differ on at differ time brought the develop forward for nuclear power the state assum an essenti role as a guarantor in order to make the develop easier even in recent time there ar exampl that such develop block have origin the foremost exampl is the develop of larg heat pump in which asea stal and the municip thermal power plant by act with foresight were rapidli abl to preserv the potenti of the heat pump in the district heat grid the develop of new technolog ha not been wholli concentr to the technolog triangl of cours but the swedish energi sector must still be said to be character by the fact that it includ strong and weak partial sector from the aspect of develop by development weak partial industri we mean that thei tend to underinvest in technic develop as a result of a lack of incent the usual opinion is that primarili the construct sector and the municip energi plant repres these development weak sector in the construct sector these problem ar on the product side the problem ha not been gener but wa mainli link to the multi famili dwell sector technic develop wa undertaken in order to meet stiff and rigid product standard rather than actual product develop need in combin with a nearli insati demand for the product the develop pressur wa thu veri low the reduc regulatori control which now mark the construct sector in combin with a more normal demand which lead to greater competit can be expect to increas the incent for develop in the futur thi is demonstr abov all by the experi in the small hous sector where competit pressur ha been higher and develop more favor new build standard result in electr power dure the past 10 year be the onli financi justifi altern in small hous the fact that electr heat wa instal in turn result in the market have introduc an insul standard at a higher level than prescrib by the standard the develop in the small hous sector show that the market function even as regard more effici energi if provid with favor opportun not even in the construct process itself have there been ani correspond tendenc toward underinvest on the contrari swedish compani were respons for a consider part of the intern technic develop involv the construct process that the municip power plant repres a development weak industri is primarili explain by the fact that there were weak owner the owner were influenc by interest group which want the municip energi plant to keep the rate as low as possibl in the short run which necessarili creat difficulti for the compani in undertak project of an r d natur which in the short term predominantli mean higher cost for the compani thi tendenc wa reinforc by the ampl support which wa given the invest pattern have chang so that the govern had to put up a signific part of the cost without the subsidi the owner would most like have had to assum greater respons for the compani develop so that the presenc of financi develop subsidi contribut to a poorer develop than what would otherwis have been the case 3 3 why did the develop turn out thi wai a few factor seem particularli import in order to explain the develop the develop of the market the interplai and relationship between the variou player the condit of the surround world it is in thi connect essenti to distinguish between the earlier develop up to the mid 1970 s and the chang which have occur sinc then the earlier develop the last strong growth in energi and particularli electr consumpt creat a power need for new capac thi open up major market opportun for innov compani the rapid growth also reduc the invest risk for the power compani in that strong growth situat it wa not a direct catastroph for a compani in a monopolist situat if capac happen to be expand somewhat to quickli after onli a few year new demand develop which caus the facil to be need regard the player structur it can be note that cooper ha taken place between quit larg compani and that there have been close relationship and major confid in on anoth s capabl accordingli on ha been convinc that the problem could actual be solv and if ani project were to fail contrari to expect the parti would manag to accept financi failur without insurmount difficulti at the same time it wa obviou that the buyer side would assum some of the risk with the develop work sup 3 it should also be note that there wa strong govern involv as support for thi develop other than in except case the support did not affect technic or commerci question but meant that the player could anticip that the rule of the game in the cooper would not drastic chang dure the cours of the work the compani could thu us long depreci period for new invest sinc on wa act in a polit and market wise veri stabl environ the govern also influenc the develop through the heavili regul credit market sinc there were low nomin interest rate and there wa plenti of capit becaus of the extens public save for exampl the later develop dure the most recent 20 year period the condit for energi technolog have gradual chang market opportun have chang both for the industri and the energi compani the cost of technic develop have also risen an often repres view is that swedish industri ha becom more short sight dure the 1970 s and 1980 s it is quit clear that over the more recent 25 year period the major of industri compani ha encount a faster pace of chang in the surround world includ for exampl more rapid market chang and greater intern competit as a reaction to thi greater pace of chang in the rest of the world in the late 1960 s an alter leadership philosophi emerg within the manufactur industri quarterli balanc sheet division and profit unit creat more pressur on compani manag alwai to show a good result the trend wa reinforc by the wave of incorpor and dispers of ownership dure the 1980 s in all thi develop ha been favor by creat greater pressur on compani manag to work more activ with the firm develop but at the same time it ha of cours heighten interest in the compani s short term goal greater concentr on short term issu doe not howev as ha sometim been indic necessarili mean lower effici in the long term if the surround world ha chang it is necessari to undertak measur against or adjust to these chang at the same time there is obvious risk that focus on the long term which is also necessari for the compani s long rang success mai be neglect in thi process the energi compani also face a less predict futur dure thi period the energi price fluctuat had been a constant problem sinc the begin of the 1970 s the price fluctuat were reinforc by the effect caus by vari tax and environment fee often there were also subsidi avail for new invest which further increas the uncertainti about the cost of variou altern add to thi the polit uncertainti about the futur of nuclear power which meant that there wa some risk that 50 percent of the electr power product capac would need replac in the short term as for the market develop the 1970 s repres a clearli lower rate of growth accord to the offici energi statist the energi consumpt even decreas sup 4 in the earli 1980 s the simultan econom boom convers to electr heat and the expans of the district heat grid led to rapid market growth in both the electr power and heat sector on the electr power side thi develop wa of cours facilit by the fact that new nuclear power plant rapidli enter the system in the late 1970 s and earli 1980 s the rate of growth in recent year even regardless of the effect of the econom condit ha decreas as a result of greater energi effici and the fact that convers to electr and district heat ha halt thi limit growth ha not requir new product capac to ani major extent and new invest dure the second half of the 1980 s have been veri limit in the area of power as well as of heat the higher interest rate situat ha also had a major impact in the direct of project with a short period of repay thi appli to both industri and energi compani the opportun for technolog develop have also chang swedish refer facil and oper experi have been veri import for the further commerci of new technolog a certain chang ha occur howev which can be exemplifi by the domin compani in the field in sweden abb sweden is still an import domest market for the major of abb compani activ in sweden of cours howev dure the 1970 s and 1980 s an internation of the electr engin industri took place which result in sweden no longer have the same charact of springboard to the world for abb as wa the case for asea previous the compani essenti search out develop problem in sweden and develop product for the swedish market which were then adapt for other market nowadai the technic develop in the electr engin industri take place for the intern market and the swedish market no longer occupi the same special posit the correspond develop also appli to mani other compani small as well as larg which ar activ in the infrastructur field sup 5 on drive forc behind thi develop ha been higher develop cost as a result of increasingli advanc and complex technic system which mean that the develop cost must be distribut over a larger market that provid increasingli fewer opportun for special nation solut in market which ar compar small such as the swedish on anoth import drive forc in sweden is that the combin of lower market growth and a modern establish structur ha meant that there wa no need for new facil after the introduct of nuclear power thi forc the industri compani to direct their ey even more toward the need of the surround world altogeth thi ha the result that there is increasingli less relev in speak of specif swedish technolog develop in the energi field it appli to a particularli high degre in the electr power sector the same develop trend can also be notic in the heat sector howev although thi develop is somewhat later in time as a result of gener lower develop cost and a larger domest market all the factor given abov contribut to the gener of fewer long rang develop project in sweden in the energi field over the past 10 15 year compar to what wa previous the case 3 4 develop trend for the futur in thi section will be discuss develop trend and their potenti effect on the technic develop just as all other predict for the futur these must be treat with caution there ar a number of indic that both the electr power and the heat market in sweden and in our immedi environ face a histor break with the trend even if industri growth dure the 1990 s will be good which is desir it is like that the growth in energi consumpt will be of limit extent at the same time the physic plant structur is rel modern and particularli in the area of electr power a certain increas in demand could be met by increas output from exist facil the greater european integr of electr system simultan lead to more effici util of exist reserv and for that reason thei can be shrunk from an overal point of view in gener thi argu for a limit need for new construct of power and thermal facil for quit a long time at least 10 year which ha a consider impact on the penetr of new technolog especi against the background of the modern facil structur remodel for exampl as a result of stricter environment requir and current mainten and modern will take place but these ar measur of compar limit extent new invest could of cours occur even over a shorter time frame in that case probabl for reason of competit in the wake of the now ongo regul if a more extens export market for electr power should develop thi could also lead to new invest nuclear power still repres an uncertainti factor of cours with consider consequ for the plan by the energi compani sinc it will affect the time at which new product capac will be need if nuclear power is to be abolish by the year 2010 veri extens new construct will have to be start within a 10 year period while more extens replac invest can otherwis wait sinc new technolog is introduc in connect with new invest and nuclear power abolit will lead to a forc invest wave the opportun for rapid spread of new technolog will be greater if nuclear power is abolish that thi is the case should not be interpret as thi report advoc such abolit spread new technolog is not an end in itself even the continu develop of scientif knowledg in the area of climat could lead to continu polit uncertainti for a long time an interest develop with potenti consequ for technic develop is the deregul of certain energi market which is under wai thi market liber wave which is an intern phenomenon and includ among other thing greater privat ownership of energi compani lead to a gradual transit from an express social servic role in the direct of greater similar with other industri activ includ the same demand for financi profit for the owner and with a posit that is tangibl more expos to competit express social respons for exampl in the form of deliveri oblig and cost base price is begin to dissolv the role more similar to other industri activ also includ introduc competit for custom previous the energi compani had an assur custom base other compani were exclud through the concess when the market is open up the produc doe not sit as secur in hi market which introduc an addit element of risk into the commerci evalu of new invest project against the background of the factor mention abov it appear like that the compani orient to some extent will be guid toward activ that pai off more rapidli thi could have the consequ of reduc willing to assum risk for long rang and uncertain technic develop project at the same time experi in other area indic that competit stimul technic develop by increas pressur on the organ to us their resourc in the most effici manner experi from other technic similar industri such as the chemic engin industri or the forest industri indic that there is no conflict between short term econom profit and invest in long term technic develop and new technolog rather the opposit in a market expos to competit short term profit is a precondit for compani invest suffici much in r d and dare to undertak purchas of previous untest technolog natur it is necessari to have the simultan capabl and resourc to do thi accordingli the reduc risktak indic abov is like to be primarili a temporari phenomenon which will mark the energi industri in the restructur phase now under wai in the long run competit abil is creat in thi industri just as in most other type of industri activ larg by invest in new technolog when the compani have found their new posit the view of new technolog will not be fundament differ from what ha tradition been the case as wa previous mention we in sweden us to have a low real interest rate for energi invest that is to sai the energi price increas wa close to the nomin interest rate which favor major invest todai we have a deregul credit market with high interest rate there is much indic that the tendenc of compar high interest rate and low inflat will continu for the futur thi could affect the develop in the direct of less invest heavi technolog and toward technolog which involv shorter repay period as a counterbal to thi tendenc there is now at the same time an internation credit market thi result in an equal of the financi term and the internation capit market is like in the long run to lead to more effect financi market and thu to a certain downward pressur on interest rate on question for the futur is whether todai there is ani relev whatsoev in the technolog triangl earlier describ as wa mention in the previou section the ti between the electr engin industri and the power industri have weaken primarili as a result of the global of the suppli industri the now ongo deregul of the electr power market is like to mean that the relationship between the power industri and the electr intens industri will be affect to a certain extent the power industri can be expect to focu a greater part of it interest on higher pai custom in other countri societi s role of stronger emphasi on market solut which is support by the present eea european econom area ec adjust will further weaken the technolog triangl and for the futur on might thu question whether it is not more or less in the process of dissolv with the greater internation in the wake of the ec intern market major chang ar under wai with gener impact on societi the chang in the financi market and the transport market will be especi great of cours in the energi sector as well the consequ will be signific although it is difficult to predict exactli what these chang will be howev thi increas internation further accentu the need for acquir knowledg and technolog from the surround world 4 societi and the develop of energi technolog the follow chapter discuss societi s opportun to influenc commerci develop of energi technolog the discuss is supplement by the case studi materi which is given in supplement 2 societi s impact on technic develop can in principl be divid into two categori effort which influenc the climat for technic develop in societi effort which ar more directli aim at stimul all or certain innov activ innov support the main purpos of thi chapter is to discuss the latter activ sinc dure the cours of the work it ha becom increasingli clear that a favor climat for technic develop gener speak is of much greater signific for the firm develop strength we will begin by take a closer look at climat factor of particular import precis for the develop of energi technolog 4 1 the climat for technic develop the develop which wa describ in the previou section with more intern competit and weaker nation network further accentu if that is possibl the import of the innov climat for develop in order to be competit it is probabl not enough for sweden to have an innov climat that is as good as in other countri sweden with a small domest market larg distanc to custom market a minor languag etc must in order to compet have a more favor climat for industri activ compar to those countri which have better precondit becaus of size and geograph locat five especi import climat factor for the develop of energi technolog have been identifi basic research and educ long rang stabil in govern regul the interest rate level energi tax and fee gener econom polici inflat tax burden of these the first and last on ar like to be import in gener while the three in the middl ar of special signific for the energi sector thi is due to the depend on the long perspect in invest and the high capit intens a great deal of know how in basic research and educ is essenti partli becaus of the research result as such but perhap to at least as larg a degre as a sourc of good personnel for the compani compet in academ institut is satisfactori in principl howev there ar area in which societi should try to strengthen the expertis the field most import to industri to which thi appli is electr power technolog and nuclear technolog field which tend to be neglect in the govern s major concentr on energi research previous commerc and industri to some extent tri to compens for thi through it own effort in academ institut which turn out not to be easi in part becaus of the manag form of the institut it is necessari for the polit decis of import for the industri to be stabl and have long rang credibl in a situat where decis factor affect decis cannot be predict at all the compani increas their concentr on the short term perspect measur which offer extrem high flexibl will also be priorit overal these flexibl solut ar not alwai the on which would be most ration in a more stabl environ long rang activ particularli those which involv consider commit for the futur ar shelv while wait for the abil to have a better overview of the condit as wa mention in chapter 2 the develop of oper cost ha often turn out to have a fundament effect on profit becaus of the price develop for energi raw materi and for the fiscal and fee polici the market fluctuat in the raw materi market have been difficult to predict particularli sinc 1973 by introduc yet anoth uncertainti in the form of variat in tax and fee the problem have becom nearli insurmount dure the 1980 s the municip energi compani abov all oper in a veri difficult environ in thi respect and the invest made in coal technolog for instanc dure the first half of the 1980 s support by the govern turn out to be less success after the state within the cours of a few year rais the coal tax from zero to a level approxim three time higher than the coal price in on import respect tax chang introduc an even greater assess difficulti than normal market chang market chang ar cyclic in natur at the same time invest decis often have a lifetim span sever market cycl the result is that invest decis contrari to the market develop if on succe in overwint the downturn phase often still turn out to be fortun in the long term govern regul do not have thi cyclic natur which is why a decis that is wrong becaus futur chang in govern regul were misjudg rare turn out to be fortun the vari tax on energi have not onli increas market uncertainti but have also had an immedi neg impact on the technic develop by reduc the incent for technic develop thi effect can also be exemplifi with the situat regard the tax on coal the proport of tax of the total cost for coal mention abov ha vari greatli over a short time period i todai s situat coal can be convert to electr power us the most effici and best environment adapt technolog with an effici of more than 40 percent the hope for the new coal gasif technolog is to be abl to achiev an increas in effici of about 5 7 percent over a 10 20 year time frame no matter how essenti thi improv is it is insignific compar to the tax chang incent to start a lengthi r d project to improv a process by some percentag point while the rule mai suddenli alter the cost by perhap 10 20 percent will be extrem limit instead the businessman is like to perceiv that resourc should be concentr either to get the decis point in a direct which favor hi own interest or not to do anyth at all while wait and hope for the situat to be clarifi as wa mention earlier the interest level is of crucial import for the profit of the energi project and thu for the opportun for bring about technic develop thi appli especi to develop of capit intens system the develop under wai in eea ec agreement ha alreadi result in an equal of the interest level in variou countri a tendenc which can be expect to continu the interest level can thu not be influenc nation as much as befor but in a small countri such as sweden it is primarili internation determin and onli slightli affect by the gener econom climat 4 2 motiv and mean of innov support sup 6 societi s interest in the develop of energi technolog just as in all other technic develop is of cours to see to it that technic develop progress with good speed and that it get an orient which coincid with the gener good do so potenti involv three differ type of influenc acceler technic develop limit the us of technolog with consequ neg for societi guid technic develop toward the direct desir for societi in most area of technolog societi s interest ha mainli involv the first aspect in area of technolog where the activ ha potenti neg consequ for peopl and environ which concern mani type of process industri includ energi societi also ha an interest in reduc or complet elimin the us of certain type of technolog in the field of energi the third type of influenc ha also been of signific for exampl in the form of societi s select have tri to stimul certain technolog such as wind power bioenergi etc it is not obviou that societi need to take ani respons for technolog develop by busi in a function market the technolog need will be produc and is econom defens the fundament reason why societi realli ha to stimul technic develop is therefor that there ar said to be market failur which make the motiv for technic develop by privat organ too weak from a socioeconom aspect below we list four argument which have been brought up as to why thi should be the case 1 r d result ar of a collect natur which is why the social benefit ar greater than that of the individu compani thu project exist which should be undertaken from a socioeconom aspect but which have no busi econom profit and should therefor not be undertaken without subsidi 2 compani and financi avoid particularli riski activ if thei can it is usual said that thei have a high avers to risk sinc r d project often carri unusu high risk thi result in few r d project be start thi risk profil of technic develop project further caus the capit market to be unwil to provid resourc for thi type of project if it doe it is on particularli unfavor term 3 the cost of develop and abov all invest in new technolog of an infrastructur charact ar often of such extent that the capit market cannot cope with such larg project if it doe manag it the term will be particularli unfavor so the govern must help 4 the assess by the market of the us and cost of technolog can differ from that of societi for exampl by not fulli includ the environment hazard from variou type of technolog in the compani financi evalu technolog of major benefit to societi must therefor be stimul so that it becom competit these ar thu fundament reason and as is shown in section 4 4 and 4 5 there is no lack of argument against sever of the reason given abov mean of support innov in principl there ar three basic method to formul the mean of control innov regul financi mean of control educ and inform regul ha tradition been societi s most import method for limit neg environment effect sup 7 in the energi sector the financi mean of control can be of mani kind and includ carrot subsidi and whip fee for develop variou categori of financi mean of control ar shown below figur 4 1 financi mean of control in the innov field subsidi see below tax and fee govern purchas of technolog r d carri out or purchas by the state sourc accord to folster 1991 subsidi in turn can be provid in a number of differ wai accord to the tabl below figur 4 2 innov support subsidi gener subsidi r d tax deduct gener support for r d in specif industri select subsidi direct project grant subsid loan loan with favor term loan guarante honor sourc accord to folster 1991 in order to acceler the develop direct project grant to the energi field ha been the princip method while tax and fee have obvious been the method for reduc the neg effect of technolog applic sup 8 educ and inform ar a third type of control sup 9 by provid inform about what is possibl and how to go about it a respons is expect from the user in gener inform ha not been us as much as a mean of control innov as the other two method that is becaus it is not known in advanc to the same extent what the result of thi type of measur will be from thi perspect regul ar the most appeal of cours 4 3 experi of swedish and foreign support for energi innov in thi section certain observ ar made regard the effect of support innov the materi is base on both swedish and foreign experi with a certain domin for swedish experi it is of cours extrem difficult unambigu to comment on the overal effect of a number of differ measur howev we outlin a few princip direct regard the experi the most success role of swedish societi as a develop of new energi technolog ha been as owner of the former nation waterfal agenc which within the framework of the owner s polit prioriti act with integr base on relev technic and econom principl and in thi wai greatli contribut to the develop of energi technolog in the countri sever of the most signific new product which origin in sweden were develop for the need of the waterfal agenc thi ha been a consequ of the enterpris s busi activ and is therefor someth differ than govern innov support it is thu not possibl to draw ani conclus about the form of support which involv govern technolog purchas base on the result achiev by the govern s public servic enterpris a gener which is sometim done as for the innov support societi s environment regul appear to be the most success area the measur have often led to the intend result thi is true in sweden as well as abroad in gener the support for innov in order to guid the us of technolog toward more environment friendli technolog seem to be more or less without object howev in some case applic of these regul ha repres an obstacl to new technolog new technolog alwai lead to certain breakin problem the fact that in some case temporari exempt for emiss regul were not grant ha caus the choic of more tradit solut which in the long run were probabl poorer in sever case it is obviou that the financi support move up the project somewhat which wa not alwai good for the develop process but led to the result have been forc out and immatur product be present to the market among equip manufactur it is most strike how small the effect of the support ha been for the compani activ and it is rare that the support measur in themselv have initi new project thi rel disinterest should be view in the light of the r d function s strateg charact for the long term surviv of the industri enterpris it is through the result for which the develop function is respons that surviv is assur the fact that the develop cost ar paid for is not enough of an incent to put the compani s best resourc into develop but it requir a firm convict that the project will lead to product which in turn can gener a profit in a commerci market that doe not alwai mean howev that the compani ar disinterest in support if such is avail given that it ha been decid to invest in a certain develop all opportun for financ ar welcom thi mean that as long as econom support in variou form is given to compani the compani will concentr on obtain these fund for project which the compani want to undertak the compani will also as long as it ha a chanc of get the fund stubbornli insist that the support is need among energi enterpris it ha been more common that the opportun for get support have also affect the choic of which project to carri out thi is probabl becaus the develop function is not the compani s life blood in the same sens and that cover the cost is therefor a stronger incent anoth reason is that sinc support in variou form ha been given for such a long time the compani and their owner have in some case gotten us to the fact that technic develop is undertaken with partial govern fund and a lack of support mean that the project will not be undertaken 4 4 the princip problem of energi innov support the follow section deal with the problem which have emerg regard financi innov support in particular in which we also includ subsidi such as taxat aim at priorit certain technolog these difficulti have primarili been of three kind social time frame opportun for success project select and the neg effect which can ensu from support experi ar base mainli on swedish innov support dure the 1970 s and 1980 s the project select on reason for the problem with develop support is that the govern ha had a difficult time make earli good assess of develop project which is why the veri import project start rare becom veri effect the reason for these problem ar in part that it is complex to select the right project to support and partli that innov program must also take variou polit consider for exampl region and energi polit on into account it is difficult to make a sensibl choic of which technolog to back what is a good project signifi both that the project itself is promis and that it fit into the organ s overal strategi it is thu difficult for an outsid to make these evalu even if he is profession compet there ar also reason to assum that the select will be poorer than would have been necessari sinc an innov support program is usual design with regard for thing other than find exactli the right project even if a polit decis is right there will soon be an elect which could mean that a new group with other prioriti will come to power and that new project will be given prioriti befor the old on have gotten there often region consider ar taken into account and other type of consider which in themselv could be justifi for exampl base on region polici but which could lead to certain other type of project with less abil to compet be priorit the short time frame of social support as wa mention in chapter 2 commerci technic develop usual ha a time frame of perhap 10 year from idea to market dure thi entir period the financi backer must if need be prepar to come up with new resourc in order to bring the project forward direct financi social support for the develop of energi technolog ha been paid over an entir differ time scale often encompass no more than a three year period a develop project which stand and fall with the grant of a lot of support throughout the entir develop period is thu run a veri larg risk of failur the fact that fund is avail for a normal limit period of time risk increas the compani shortsighted and increas the market uncertainti when support is given as a on time contribut for exampl in the form of an invest subsidi for a demonstr facil it risk lead to an invest hump follow by a drop when the support disappear when the support is given in the form of run subsidi the addit cost must be calcul over the rel short period which the support can be assum to span dure the 1980 s sever compani made dubiou invest decis in retrospect as a result of not have anticip that the regul would chang so quickli todai the enterpris have learn from thi and in gener practic greater caution in undertak invest which depend on long term contribut and subsidi for their profit the awar of the need for stabl rule for industri develop ha increas in societi in recent year to a certain extent thi is a result of experi in the field of energi technolog in particular the greater internation also ha the result that more stabil can be predict for the futur at the same time it must be conclud that there ar hardli ani chanc of get back to the stabil which mark the develop of the postwar period becaus of an increasingli turbul world neg effect of the innov support on motiv for societi s innov support is also to influenc the market base incent for develop and applic of technolog of cours there ar certain risk that the natur tendenc toward innov mai be affect in the energi field the follow neg effect have been observ by forc a develop for instanc through a combin of develop and introduct support on risk bring a product to market which is actual not finish thi result in the earli custom get a neg view of the technolog which lead to a cool recept for matur product that have been further develop the most neg effect is of a psycholog natur the long term subsidi have led to a not uncommon view among owner of energi compani that technic develop should take place with societi s support thi result in project sometim tend to be rank accord to wherev support is avail and that intrins promis project ar not follow up becaus no support can be obtain 4 5 is continu econom support for commerci develop of technolog necessari the motiv for societi to provid support for energi innov have been of four differ type as wa mention that r d is a collect product that the compani have a high avers to risk that the capit market cannot cope with financ larg project and that neg environment effect ar not taken into consider in the evalu by the marketplac the collect natur of r d on the averag r d project undoubtedli provid a larg amount of socioeconom benefit within the energi sector howev thi is primarili due to a few project which ar veri profit both for the enterpris and for societi few project ar not profit from a busi econom point of view but should still be carri out from the aspect of societi in connect with the deregul which is now under wai in the energi market there is some risk that the great open which ha character the energi compani with jointli own develop compani and project could declin somewhat it is essenti for the tradit of joint industri project and compani concern research educ and evalu of new technolog to be abl to continu sinc these activ facilit the spread of knowledg within the industri which ought possibl to be stimul by a certain social support the compani avers to risk the compani within the energi sector have previous not gener avoid becom involv in long term develop project with technic and econom risk if the potenti gain from the develop project were found to be suffici larg dure the 1980 s tendenc toward a certain avers to risk could be glimps thi is to some extent a result of the gener econom develop dure the 1980 s but it is chiefli a result of the plenti suppli of govern fund avail for the right project sinc the energi industri is mark by larg financi secur compani there ar also no major financi difficulti in undertak develop project we thu look onli at the special need to support compani for energi technolog develop to the extent gener commerci subsidi ar avail for instanc in order to facilit obtain risk capit by small and medium size compani energi compani should of cours have the same opportun as other the capac of the capit market with the internation capit market the financ of new energi technolog infrastructur at reason cost is manag without direct govern help a reason for the govern to support thi can onli occur as a result of rapid abolit of nuclear power thi could conceiv lead to a new wave of invest which would have enorm consequ for the electr power market unless a part of the financ is pass onto societi extern market factor reduc environment effect by mean of intern environment cost will continu to be an import field for societi prefer in intern cooper it should be note in thi connect that in the major of case regul ar the method which ha been us for success contribut despit the fact that fee ar regard as prefer from a strictli econom aspect thi is becaus it is much easier to know what you get with a regul and that a regul can be a clearer signal to the market about what is need environment fee have often turn out to be a blunt instrument a contribut caus for thi is that it can be easi to confus fee as a mean of stimul technolog develop with the fiscal natur of fee in principl iva is not oppos to econom mean of control if handl correctli that is to sai as a mean of control and not as a mean of taxat and if the field is suitabl for thi type of control 5 recommend regard societi s role in commerci develop of energi technolog in chapter 2 the success factor for technic develop project were analyz and the extent to which the energi field differ in thi respect from other field of technolog chapter 3 dealt with develop pattern for technic develop in the energi sector and chapter 4 analyz societi s mean of influenc the compani technic develop as well as swedish and foreign experi of the measur emploi societi s most import task in order to facilit the develop of energi technolog is to creat an industri and innov climat which lead to good profit develop in the busi and thu to invest in industri activ be more profit than invest in properti for exampl on condit for a well function busi commun is a function research system which is capabl of suppli busi and industri with new knowledg and new carrier of knowledg thi requir high qualiti research at univers and academ institut in field of technolog relev to busi and industri in order to assur thi relev expand cooper between busi and academ institut is need thi concern abov all the opportun for univers and academ institut to obtain stimuli and signal from busi and industri regard essenti research field within the framework for thi there should be much greater academ freedom regard the research field a the same time societi should bear primari respons for financ basic research and educ in todai s situat societi take too littl respons for thi in some area which ar of major import for the energi sector in some case the result wa that industri had to come in and help financ such activ for exampl regard the electr power center at the royal institut of technolog kth in other case altogeth too littl activ is be carri out for exampl in reactor technolog simultan the energi industri is face major chang from have been a nation industri with servic charact to greatli increas internation becaus we ar a small countri it is particularli import that we ar capabl of particip in the intern cooper and exchang of experi it is therefor essenti for academ research to be given greater abil to exchang experi and time for adjust to the r d program which exist within the ec abov all societi should therefor increas it fund of direct academ research within consum specif field help expand the contact surfac between academ institut and the busi commun and creat more resourc for particip in intern program on should also strive for more intern exchang and activ particip in plan and undertak intern research cooper in order to increas intern influenc on swedish energi research the energi sector ha been character by major uncertainti dure the 1970 s and 1980 s thi is in part a result of market fluctuat in part a result of major turbul regard the fiscal and fee polici as well as regard the futur of nuclear power energi tax ar of fundament import for the profit of invest in the futur regulatori and fee system must be design in a more consist more credibl and more durabl wai so that precondit ar creat for a stabl market and consequ opportun for the compani to develop and invest in new more effici and for the environ more accept product and system within the energi sector societi not onli ha an interest in technic develop proceed rapidli but also in the applic of technolog be shift over toward technolog which ha minor or prefer no impact on the environ in remark mani instanc the market forc have been abl to produc thi greater environment adapt on exampl is the develop of technolog for bleach cellulos societi ha a self evid respons to monitor that thi is the case and where that doe not happen societi s larg success work in the environment sector must go on howev measur in thi area must to an increas degre be announc in advanc or at least be forese with a certain prioriti sinc the measur could otherwis lead to reduc willing to take risk there must also be a certain flexibl in the regul so that dure the introductori period there is some margin in the event the new technolog cannot cope with the impos standard if not the rule risk have a technolog preserv effect to the extent econom mean of control ar us thei must be us as a mean of improv the environ for exampl and not as a wai to augment govern revenu furthermor econom mean of control must not be us in combin with regul sinc thei will then automat get thi fiscal charact and not be technolog promot measur should natur be undertaken in such a manner and at such a pace that the opportun for carri out industri activ in sweden is not advers affect measur should be undertaken in intern cooper or at least in coordin with the intern develop other than mean of control intend to intern environment cost we believ that if the innov climat for energi technolog can be reinforc with the measur mention abov there is no need for direct financi support for the develop of energi technolog direct toward individu compani or smaller group of compani new technolog will mainli enter the energi system in connect with new invest dure the 1990 s the need for new invest in the swedish energi system appear to be of limit extent the opportun for broad distribut of new technolog in sweden in the short term is extrem limit and contribut aim at a rapid breakthrough of new suppli technolog will scarc be success subsidi ar also not the solut for support the technic develop in the development weak industri a consider portion of the subsidi have particularli as regard multifamili dwell and premis been a poorli function market deregul and increas competit can be expect to result in these market function better in the futur thi is indic by the posit develop involv energi manag in small hous a market which ha work much better as a result of tough competit and less extens subsidi the situat among municip energi plant is more difficult the industri is development weak primarili as a result of it weak owner who did not permit the compani to alloc resourc for new technic develop project the tendenc ha been reinforc by the ampl support which ha been given to thi sector sinc it permit the strategi mention abov it is possibl to speak of the develop support have function as some sort of drug for the compani if the support were not avail it would be more obviou to owner that thei have to make decis to invest in technic develop and the incent for develop would thu be increas thi neg view of the effect of financi support also includ govern purchas of technolog to be sure there ar exampl that the ongo technolog purchas program ha contribut to sever success develop project iva assess is howev that these develop process would have come about anywai therefor the program ha instead been success in catch on earli to a develop alreadi establish by the market rather than establish new develop process it is also remark that in the area of make energi more effici there have been sever parallel activ initi by variou player both govern and privat someth which mai be question in sum the conclus of thi reason is that direct govern effort direct toward support the compani develop of new energi technolog will not be of decis import for the develop of futur energi technolog sup 10 thi appli to both support for new suppli technolog and new applic technolog the more extens subsidi for thi orient given at present ar the energi technolog fund the experiment construct support and the technolog purchas support for more effici energi technolog we propos a cancel of these subsidi the energi technolog fund and the technolog purchas program each have a budget of about 150 200 million kronor a year up to 1996 and the experiment construct program about 10 million a year in connect with the increas market orient and internation which the energi industri is undergo it is particularli import to retain the valuabl swedish tradit of extens cooper within the energi industri joint research by a specif industri is an import method for thi it is reason that some of the fund releas abov should be shift to stimul these jointli own develop project and develop compani it is essenti for thi activ to be manag under it own respons with a view to the greater internation and the need for greater intern influenc within the sector it would be especi desir if societi could also contribut to joint industri research in which intern player ar particip and thu be abl to share the result strengthen joint research in an industri need not mean establish new institut which risk becom rigid and in the

illustr is what determin the direct and speed of technic develop the main issu can be divid into the follow question where do idea for new product and process come from when doe an idea becom a major

joint goal the project also demonstr the complic interplai when energi aspect ar onli on of a number of differ consider which ar involv in a decis to invest in new process technolog but that new energi technolog in a consider wai can further reinforc the breakthrough of the new technolog in the market the cast technolog case demonstr that even matur industri can undergo rapid technic chang when a number of differ factor ar present at the same time the case also show that such chang ar often connect with major new invest and thu cannot be view independ from invest cycl the pfbc case stress among other thing the long run in for mani technic develop project that sever differ interest parti can be present in a develop project and how the direct of a larg and complic project can chang over the cours of the develop process the stirl engin case demonstr how import and difficult the market evalu for new technolog is technolog can be gener applic while onli be competit within a narrow segment which these segment ar can also chang rel rapidli two of the case fiberopt technolog and mobil telephon lie outsid the energi sector in order to provid an opportun to compar the technic develop process in variou field of technolog these two technolog belong to a field which is normal regard as less matur at the same time as it still involv technolog of an infrastructur natur which is why the differ ar not judg to be as larg and comparison therefor becom meaning in principl technic develop project can be classifi at three differ level and it is import to make thi distinct clear 1 ration ration mean minor chang of an exist product thi type of product is often veri import for rais the perform of a product or reduc it manufactur cost these project ar normal connect with small technic and commerci risk 2 new industri develop by thi is meant project of consider size aim at develop a product base on new technolog or fulfil an entir new market demand thi type of project is usual link with extens technic and commerci risk 3 nation power drive thi type of project which is common in the defens sector mean that no individu group of commerci player is abl to cope with the task as a result of it technic complex and risk and becaus of the major econom effort that ar requir instead thi type of project demand extens govern guarante and perhap govern found of new organ such as new research institut in order to be carri out thi also appli if the greater part of the develop work is carri out within the busi sector these seven case mai chiefli be said to belong to the second categori of project new industri develop project 2 power transmiss with high voltag direct current hvdc the idea of us direct current for long power transmiss exist as earli as the 1800s in the infanc of electr engin there ar advantag of direct current system for us with long power line at the end of the 1800 s the three phase system arriv in which jona wenstrom who found asea wa on of the pioneer the advantag with altern current wa that it wa possibl to rais the voltag and thu expand the distribut area the first major power transmiss with altern current in sweden were introduc in the earli 1900 s and were at 30 to 50 kv in the 1910 s vattenfal began to pose demand on the swedish market for higher voltag and larger transform such as for the first 130 kv trollhattan vastera alvkarlebi trunk line in the mid 1920 s asea had also succeed in it effort to rais transform manufactur to an internation competit level in the 1920 s the ey onc again turn toward high voltag direct current transmiss at asea if the big problem around direct and altern high voltag current were to be solv direct current system could becom cheaper for larg power transmiss over long distanc and long

current transmiss would offer advantag for the swedish electr power grid in which the princip energi resourc in the form of hydroelectr power resourc were found in the thinli popul northern part while the center of consumpt lai in the southern part of the countri larg quantiti of energi would soon need to be transport across approxim 1 000 kilomet the cost of the power line in a high voltag direct current system is lower than in a convent altern current system the cost for end station is higher for direct current howev in order to offer an econom competit altern the transmiss distanc must therefor be long for the direct current altern which what wa also the case in the countri borgquist s strongli express interest in an introduct of high voltag direct current is like to have contribut to asea decis to continu to expand the long rang and costli develop work which includ a larg proport of basic physic and electr research and develop the contact between uno lamm and waldemar borgquist go back to the end of the 1930 s and their relationship wa good in 1943 asea and vattenfal agre on a test facil for high voltag direct current in trollhattan a so call ion valv laboratori wa built where asea construct manufactur and deliv experiment rectifi with associ equip and measur devic vattenfal also made avail a 55 kv line between trollhattan and mellerud test continu for sever year up to the earli 1960 s sinc the physic and electr principl for a rectifi could not entir be mathemat describ the test of variou construct wa of decis import long term test under realist condit also provid experi with the wear of the rectifi studi of the power line between the convers station were undertaken in the 1940 s vattenfal resum project for harspranget which had been initi dure the 1910 s the origin intent wa to us high voltag direct current for transmiss of energi from harspranget to hallsberg waldemar borgquist wa passion about it at asea on wa more unsur the project wa too big to dare invest in the technolog sinc the voltag were high test carri out at vattenfal show that the direct current altern wa a passabl rout but too risk fill sinc the power product from harspranget would be of crucial import for the total power product in the countri on did not dare take the step it wa necessari for harspranget not to be delai harspranget wa readi for direct current howev the gener for exampl were prepar for altern us of both altern and direct current for harspranget a 400 kv altern current transmiss wa chosen the highest voltag at that time for long distanc even thi solut wa risk fill to be sure harspranget wa put into oper in 1951 in 1950 the riksdag decid to us high voltag direct current transmiss for an underwat cabl between the mainland and gotland waldemar borgquist person had a major part in the decis on gotland electr power wa gener by small diesel turbin and steam turbin electr power product on gotland wa twice as expens as hydroelectr power transmit power from the mainland wa a wai to lower the cost of power for gotland the state contribut with invest and project cost for the transmiss link the project wa ideal for asea sinc it wa of a rel modest size asea would be abl manag without major problem even if the project fail all the problem had not been solv at that time but the opportun for solv them within the deliveri period were judg favor gotland would also not be without electr sinc some power product exist on the island oper began in 1954 and after some initi problem vattenfal wa abl to take over the facil befor the end of the test oper period written in the contract the world s first hvdc link high voltag direct current had been instal it length wa 100 kilomet and it carri 20 mw at 100 kv the cost for gotland s power subscrib were simultan cut in half the gotland link provid evid that the technolog wa feasibl further it wa an import demonstr facil which in the long term would make a commerci breakthrough possibl after the project howev asea demobil larg part of the project group the system had been under develop for about 25 year among other thing 140 differ variant of ga rectifi had been test the system technolog combin of tube and more convent compon for entir static convert must be stress as advanc new design dure the spring of 1957 the british central electr gener board and the french electricit de franc

other hvdc link were put into oper new zealand japan and between sweden and denmark the commerci breakthrough had occur asea had becom a world leader in thi technolog licens were sold to manufactur in both great britain and the unit state in 1959 asea sign a licens agreement with us gener electr which provid patent right regard semiconductor and thyristor howev asea goal wa quickli to disengag from the licens agreement at which it also succeed by mean of a major intern develop effort when the thyristor came peopl at asea were rel doubt of the thyristor technolog for hvdc and thei did not believ that the technolog would break through as quickli as some other competitor asea did not dare do anyth other than invest in thyristor for hvdc howev in 1965 asea began the construct and calcul principl for hvdc equip with thyristor the develop wa head by gunnar engstrom vattenfal wa a partner in thi develop phase as well the goal of the project wa to have a test rectifi in oper within two year in the gotland transmiss experi from thi project lead to the first commerci thyristor rectifi for hvdc be instal in 1970 when the gotland transmiss wa supplement by a full set of rectifi and the voltag rais to 150 kv and the transmit power to 30 mw at the end of the 1960 s asea wa forc for polit reason to withdraw from the cabora bassa project in mozambiqu where asea had offer an ga rectifi solut the order went to the aeg bbc and siemen consortium which offer a thyristor altern the competitor therefor obtain a valuabl refer object for their thyristor technolog asea which work with both technolog could see that the thyristor altern gradual strengthen it competit abil in 1971 the decis wa made to close down all develop of ga fill rectifi and concentr on the thyristor altern asea ha creat and retain a lead posit in the world even with the thyristor altern on exampl of a larg and import order wa itaipu in brazil 1983 85 where the transmiss power is 6 300 mw over a distanc of 900

which could not be bridg by the competitor final commerci did not occur until 10 year later howev a number of factor were requir for cooper in which the variou step took place in the right order in order for commerci to becom a fact 3 thermo mechan pulp and energi recoveri in thermo mechan pulp product wood consist basic of two differ compon cellulos and other carbohydr which ar the essenti compon of the fiber and lignin which keep the fiber togeth in order to make paper the fiber must be separ out in principl there ar two differ wai to creat thi separ chemic or mechan in a chemic pulp process the fiber is separ by dissolv the lignin by boil in a boil fluid consist of a sulfat solut the sulfat method or of a sulfit solut the sulfit method sinc the lignin repres a larg part of the wood substanc and thi is dissolv togeth with a larg part of the solubl carbohydr the pulp yield is onli 45 percent for sulfat pulp and 55 percent for sulfit pulp compar to 95 percent for mechan pulp in mechan pulp product the fiber of the wood ar releas by us mechan forc to tear the compon apart in thi procedur the lignin fragment remain on the fiber which explain the consider higher pulp yield the fiber of the wood ar releas by grind with a stone stone groundwood sgw or by mill refin of wood chip between grind disk refin mechan pulp rmp chemic and mechan pulp have wide differ properti the chemic pulp ha great strength becaus the fiber ar rel undamag and is therefor us for those type of paper where thi is essenti for exampl in packag paper chemic pulp is also veri suitabl for bleach which is why thi type of pulp is also us for variou type of fine paper it also ag rel well as regard light sensit and fragil mechan pulp which is much cheaper to manufactur than chemic pulp is weaker but provid a good foundat for print paper from mechan pulp also ha a veri low permeabl for light it is opaqu which is why the paper can be made thin and print on both side without it show through mechan pulp ag veri quickli howev as a result of the lower cost and the good print properti mechan pulp is the onli on us for newsprint product mechan pulp is also an import compon in cardboard and sanitari paper the grind method wa complet predomin until the earli 1960s when chip refin began to be us the grind method requir dry wood in the nordic countri in the form of spruce of not too small dimens refin were abl to us chip and therefor had greater freedom in select their assort of wood the develop from stone groundwood to refin mechan pulp wa a result of an abund of saw mill chip in the major of timber produc nation primarili in canada in order to util thi surplu it wa desir for the chip not just to be us for chemic pulp but also for product of mechan pulp the principl involv pump the wood chip through the refin in thi wai mechan pulp of rel low qualiti wa obtain with thi process the fiber wa damag just as much as in the stone groundwood process in addit the pulp got darker and often more impur when releas the fiber mechan the fiber is more or less damag which is why the bond between the fiber is weaker than in chemic pulp in order for the paper web to stai togeth on the machin and in the print press it must be reinforc with chemic pulp previous sulfit pulp wa usual emploi for thi purpos a common ratio for newsprint product wa 75 percent groundwood and 25 percent sulfit pulp mani newsprint mill thu had both a pulp grind mill and a sulfit factori in paper manufactur there is a natur balanc between increas strength on the on hand in order to increas the speed of the paper machin and print press which requir a higher proport of chemic pulp and the print qualiti which is improv by a high admixtur of mechan pulp sinc the birth of the industri the width and speed of the paper machin have constantli increas as shown in the tabl below not includ at the north american mill often us a poorer mechan pulp than in the nordic countri the develop led to such width and speed for the paper machin that the necessari admixtur of chemic pulp increas consider in addit to higher cost thi larger proport led to the print qualiti becom too poor in mani factori on therefor switch to the us of semi bleach sulfat pulp which wa a stronger pulp than the sulfit pulp and which made it possibl to reduc the admixtur but the sulfat pulp wa even more expens a supplementari reason for thi transit wa the difficult environment problem which the sulfit factori often had which result in demand that thei be remodel or close at the same time there were wish from the print factori for better print properti as a result for instanc of the introduct of four color print into the market the paper produc therefor to some extent compet to offer as good a foundat for print as possibl defibr wa found by arn asplund partli to exploit hi method for produc wood fiber board by treat wood chip with steam at 170 190 c and refin the chip in a defibr at the same temperatur under pressur the coars wood pulp wa form into board the apparatu becam known as the defibr boiler in the mid 1960 s asplund and the develop engin at defibr found that the defibr boiler could be us to modifi the rmp process so that the steam that form dure the chip refin could flow backward through the defibr boiler against the stream of chip be fed to the refin thi made the lignin in the wood more plastic the refin then becam gentler which result in a stronger pulp despit the consider higher electr power consumpt in comparison with to the groundwood process similar develop work wa under wai more or less in parallel in sever place in north america sweden and in finland asplund succeed in interest rockhammar bruk in instal a larg facil which began oper in 1968 rockhammar foremost reason for thi cooper wa that it wa look for a nich for it plant there wa no futur in be a mechan pulp factori in the old fashion wai the pulp wa sold in the market in competit with sgw and rmp the good properti of the pulp caus holmen bruk to instal a larg facil at hallstavik in 1973 a strongli drive forc behind thi develop wa einar klinga then technic director at holmen test of a newli built paper machin in hallstavik show that the pulp which wa call thermo mechan pulp tmp wa of high qualiti the first mill to be base complet on tmp wa braviken in 1977 the competitor bauer sund modifi it rmp method accord to similar principl but for sever year defibr had a lead princip becaus there were mechan difficulti with the doubl disc refin sever bauer sund facil were instal at sca paper mill ortviken for exampl both defibr sup 11 and sund conduct intens develop work in order to produc tmp for paper qualiti other than newsprint both parti found howev that there wa a lack of more basic research involv thermo mechan pulp the industri s research institut stfi in 1974 devot itself to undertak a broadli base research and develop project which wa call the t pulp project particip in thi were in addit to stfi and kth research both defibr and sund togeth with lead technician from the forest industri the project s final report wa submit in 1977 the project includ among other full scale test undertaken at hallstavik ortviken and kvarnsveden by connect to the system reutil of water water consumpt and emiss were reduc the intern environ wa radic improv by the disappear of the steam emiss on also studi modif in which chemic were ad to the refin so call chemi thermo mechan pulp ctmp which would gradual acquir major import for sanitari paper and cardboard with the t pulp project a tmp knowledg base wa develop and the knowledg spread veri rapidli within the industri a larg number of new plant were built at the paper mill as replac for the grind mill mechan pulp product is extrem power intens stone groundwood for newsprint requir 1 500 1 700 kwh per ton of pulp and tmp about 2 500 kwh for nordic spruce which is a particularli suitabl raw materi for thi purpos 1 500 1 700 kwh of which ar for refin in addit steam is need for dry the paper an obviou next step in the develop wa therefor a radic energi save in tmp refin a larg amount of secondari heat is gener in the form of water vapor with low pressur as long as the refin take place under atmospher pressur the steam can onli be us for heat hot water or altern it must be compress with a compressor both of these method were tri at the braviken plant the hot water and the steam with atmospher pressur were reserv and at hallstavik heat pump were instal as an altern method on had tri to put the whole process under pressur the result of which would be that with the help of a pressur cyclon it would be possibl to extract the steam under such pressur that it could be us as replac for fresh steam in the dry portion of the paper machin the work with thi process went on simultan in sever differ place the first supplier who show that thi pressur process function in a satisfactori wai wa jylhavaara which at it own mill in jansenkoski oper a pilot facil where steam under three bar of pressur wa extract and at the same time a good tmp pulp wa produc it wa also the first to offer such equip on the market the breakthrough into the market for thi technolog took place in approxim 1979 1980 other equip supplier rapidli follow the measur achiev a veri rapid breakthrough and result in a dramat reduct in the fuel requir for dry paper pulp todai the technolog is well develop and practic at all mill of ani signific up to 70 percent of the electr energi ad dure refin is recycl and replac new steam dure paper dry which would otherwis have been gener with a suitabl fuel sinc the tmp pulp is consider stronger than the groundwood it is possibl to make do with a consider lower admixtur of chemic pulp accordingli todai s standard newsprint 46 g sup 2 is run without ani kind of chemic pulp for reinforc at speed of 1 400 meter min here the tmp process ha had enorm import econom and from the aspect of energi while the

the leap wa a mixtur of demand the effect of product increas and demand for higher product qualiti the case is also a fine exampl of the effect of cooper between research and industri in order to reach a common goal in sweden rockhammar wa the first to instal a tmp facil the big industri breakthrough came when the larg paper mill primarili holmen hallsta rapidli follow by it competitor sca and stora built tmp facil the recycl of steam wa import here in order to improv the economi of the process and wa consequ an import factor in the rapid distribut of the technolog the develop in sweden occur at approxim the same time as the correspond develop in the larg compet countri 4 cast technolog in the steel industri over the most recent 20 year period continu cast ha becom an increasingli predomin cast process in the steel industri as earli as the mid 1980 s all commerci steel and about 40 percent of all special steel wa continu cast in sweden in ton that mean 85 90 percent of all steel in the countri the world develop ha also gone toward a higher proport of continu cast although sweden ha a larger proport of continu cast than in other compar countri for the develop of continu cast in the world after 1980 see figur 1 not includ henri bessem as earli as 1856 demonstr a continu cast process for steel bessem propos cast molten metal between two water cool roller the process soon turn out to be difficult to control howev at the begin of the 1900 s bessem s idea were again taken up thei were primarili appli to nonferr metal dure the 1930 s and 1940 s continu cast for nonferr metal becam an oper method in the 1940 s german mannesmann huettenwerk among other demonstr a continu cast process for steel in the 1950 s the industri develop of the continu cast process then took place the first swedish continu cast machin wa put into oper at nybi bruk in 1954 and oper experi were of signific in the work with continu cast in europ where on wa doubt about the opportun of the technolog other than that no major develop of the technolog took place in thi countri dure thi period in the earli 1960 s the first prototyp of continu cast facil were built in sweden in 1966 the first larg continu cast facil in the countri wa put into oper at the domnarvet ironwork in borlang after that follow oxelosund ironwork up to the mid 1980 s most block cast wa done as continu cast the drive forc for switch to continu cast in the steel industri were primarili higher yield energi save autom of the cast work personnel save improv of the materi qualiti the materi wa closer to the finish dimens the higher materi yield togeth with the energi save wa the princip reason for the breakthrough the materi save have increas by 10 15 percent with continu cast due to the higher materi yield there wa particular interest at the begin of the method develop in high alloi materi for which an increas in yield wa econom signific but the breakthrough came first on the commerci steel side which wa becaus the special steel manufactur were more uncertain of the qualiti of the materi the total energi save to produc a substanc by continu cast in comparison with block cast is also consider the energi consumpt for block cast with subsequ heat and block roll is about 1 500 kwh ton for continu cast about 500 kwh ton ar need in continu cast some process step such as heat the ingot in a pit furnac which is oil fire ar elimin onc the technolog wa well accept the emphasi wa also on improv the materi qualiti more even materi composit is obtain both lengthwis and crosswis at the begin of the period there wa uncertainti as to whether the materi qualiti could be retain it wa not until it wa possibl to prove that the qualiti of the materi could be kept or even improv that the real breakthrough came todai thi improv in qualiti is highli valu the oil crise of 1974 and 1979 acceler the develop of the continu cast technolog the energi cost primarili the cost of oil increas their share of the total oper cost it wa necessari to save energi the oil price increas by a factor of three in real term from the earli 1970 s to the earli 1980 s everi cut in oil consumpt wa valuabl the payoff time for a continu cast facil could be as short as two year for sweden the structur ration in the swedish steel industri where action wa taken earli on wa a contribut reason for the rapid penetr of the technolog continu cast achiev a more rapid breakthrough in sweden than in mani compar countri in connect with ration product wa concentr to fewer and bigger unit in mani case that meant new invest some of them involv continu cast facil the follow statist not includ show the structur chang in the industri in sweden between the year 1975 and 1988 the capac for raw iron product drop between 1975 and 1988 from about 4 1 million ton to 2 5 million ton year the capac for raw steel product drop from about 7 54 million ton year to 2 5 million ton year dure the same period of time product wa concentr to a few place instead the unit becam larger the actual product of raw steel ha remain at a stabl level from 1975 until todai the annual product of raw steel li between 4 and 5 million ton the next step in cast technolog is thin slab that is to sai a nearli finish form or direct cast of strip with thi the power consumpt can be consider reduc a decreas of up to 50 percent in comparison with continu cast can be achiev but doe not mean veri much in absolut number see figur 2 not includ the energi aspect ar also not the drive forc howev consider cost save can be achiev for invest smaller plant certain product step ar elimin and in product in the form of reduc personnel requir the technolog is begin to be commerci the first facil began oper in 1990 in the unit state nucor a plant is project in itali arweri in japan and germani thi technolog is also regard with major interest other energi save project in the steel industri ar basic warm flow mean minim of the number of reheat step of the substanc until the finish product summar analysi it can be conclud that the period from the first major instal to nearli complet penetr wa about 15 year a rel short period in thi context the technolog had been known sinc the 1950 s that is to sai about 20 year in spite of that the technolog wa not interest from a commerci point of view the reason wa mainli that there wa a lack of oper experi and full scale experi had to be done which requir refer object that the yield would increas and the energi consumpt drop wa an accept insight on the other hand there wa doubt that the qualiti of the continu cast materi could be kept begin with the period of world war ii and up to 1975 the steel industri had stabl growth in the quantiti of steel of about five percent a year new product unit could be made to pai off rel quickli and invest were mainli made in convent and proven technolog that is to sai ingot cast the real breakthrough came in connect with the necessari restructur of the industri in the latter part of the 1970 s fewer and larger product unit requir new invest dure thi period of the restructur the continu cast technolog wa rel complet and the advantag of the technolog made it natur to introduc it on a larg scale which caus it to be instal over a rather short period of time it is possibl to determin that stimul program such as govern on were larg absent in sweden as well as in the rest of the world the continu cast techniqu wa develop on a strict commerci basi thi mean that the introduct took place on it own technic and econom merit which requir a number of concurr factor for the commerci breakthrough to occur 5 pressur fluidiz bed combust of coal pfbc a fluidiz bed is simpli state a bed of particl rais by a ga flow through which make

concept there were sever reason for the interest coal had the futur ahead of it it ha a more stabl price pictur than oil and there will be enough for about 200 year but coal had the imag of be dirti and obsolet it wa a matter of find a modern wai to burn coal within the compani which at that time produc nuclear turbin and turbin and turbin system for ship for exampl a chang wa seen in the market for these the object wa to enter new market to some extent the environment aspect of combust primarili the sulfur fallout were begin to be debat and thi debat wa like to intensifi the pressur fluidiz bed could be a solut environment speak it wa believ that there wa a market and the interest shown by potenti custom wa studi in the earli 1970 s both vattenfal and sydkraft as well as some foreign compani were contact but in sweden it wa nuclear power as well as hydroelectr power that were be expand and no on saw ani need to gener power with coal simultan oil price were low and the oil crise had not yet hit the western world the pressur fluidiz bed pfbc wa known within the compani and therefor by the manag as well in 1976 curt nicolin who wa manag director of asea of which stal laval wa a subsidiari dedic a facil deliv to american electr power aep by asea in thi connect the pfbc concept wa discuss aep becam interest aep is the largest coal burn power compani in the western world and

decid to build an 80 mw test facil the spanish project ha receiv subsidi from the ec but that wa not the decid factor in the choic of technolog the facil wa put into oper in earli 1991 within the asea group it wa in the earli 1980 s believ that thee wa a market in sweden as well import factor were that on wa be forc to replac the expens oil and that the environment demand for pure combust technolog had grown stronger a polit decis had been made to abolish nuclear power it wa not a power reason but it wa sure us as an argument in some circl vattenfal plan a coal base power plant in oxelosund but that wa too far into the futur to be of ani interest in 1982 stockholm energi began to work out a propos for coal convers at the vartan facil the altern which wa develop within the energi compani

in 1938 dutch philip took up the idea of the stirl engin the reason for philip interest wa that the engin could be us to gener electr power for radio and other electr equip in unexploit area where kerosen and oil were avail primarili the dutch coloni at that time in asia as a result of the develop of the electron howev primarili the transistor interest in the stirl engin subsid at the end of the 1960 s sever swedish compani were interest in the stirl engin thi culmin in 1968 in the found of unit stirl ab in malmo owner of the compani were ffv husqvarna and kockum a licens agreement for

ffv had materi laboratori where work on heat resist materi and process of these wa carri out know how in thi field is of signific for stirl engin kockum idea wa origin to util the stirl engin in submarin the automobil industri had also particip in the discuss but it wa realli not veri interest unit stirl s first extern financ project start in 1968 69 and includ a budget of 6 million kronor the project involv stirl engin in submarin the custom wa the swedish navi sinc the potenti applic for the stirl engin were mani and interest in thi type of engin had begun to awaken the technician were to a larg extent the on who decid thei foresaw the follow applic for exampl in submarin in car truck and buse for stationari power gener for heat pump husqvarna pull out befor ani actual develop had begun and that wa chiefli for financi reason onc the shipyard crisi occur unit stirl wa transfer to svenska varv and later celsiu in 1988 unit stirl merg with kockum and becam a part of kockum kockum had been reorgan in the mid 1980 s in the 1970 s ffv had it own unit for develop of the stirl engin in linkop ffv industriprodukt ab which did not belong to unit stirl at the end of the 1970 s thi activ wa absorb into unit stirl howev certain part of the ffv branch were sold in the mid 1980 s to mcdonnel dougla after the first oil crisi in 1974 the stirl project were not affect to ani major extent the most tangibl chang wa that the potenti market primarili the unit state for stirl engin in motor home for heat and power gener disappear after the second oil crisi 1978 howev the ey turn to the stirl engin larg govern subsidi were grant internation for develop of the concept the us depart of energi doe and nasa support mani stirl project the total financi support amount to hundr of million of dollar each year govern subsidi were also provid in great britain germani franc etc there were about 10 compani worldwid which develop stirl engin for variou applic unit stirl wa on of them most were found in the unit state and germani the end of the 1970 s and earli 1980 s must be regard as the dai of glori for develop of the stirl engin for variou applic the public fund which had been alloc to the project all over the world were begin to show result mani confer and seminar were arrang about the stirl engin and it variou applic the entir field wa mark by open and optim for the futur at the end of the 1970 s and the earli 1980 s prototyp for stirl applic in car buse truck heat pump solar power system etc were present the opinion wa that some of these would becom commerci viabl within a five year period a world product of 50 000 100 000 unit a year wa discuss the prognos were larg base on continu high fuel price chiefli diesel but also gasolin and gener high energi cost in principl unit stirl had two larg intern develop project both of which were financ with feder us fund on involv a car concept financ by doe and wa aim at transfer the technolog of the stirl engin to the unit state and the develop of prototyp unit stirl s annual budget for the project were 20 million kronor a year for nine year the result of the project wa that it wa not possibl to verifi that oper of thi type of engin wa as reliabl as that of an otto engin the test with the prototyp yield good result to be sure but had not been carri out for suffici long period the cost of gasolin wa not decis the second larg project involv a solar concentr a stirl engin and a gener the system deliv a 28 percent yield of produc electr power from incid solar energi which wa total superior to compet solar energi convert the project had a total budget of sever hundr million kronor and wa partli financ by doe in 1981 the first prototyp wa built in the mojav desert in california in 1982 83 cooper

to and includ 1991 these were mainli prototyp for car buse and divers energi applic such as engin for submarin etc the intens basic develop carri out at unit stirl in the 1970 s had major signific for the technic breakthrough for stirl engin in submarin summar analysi theoret the stirl engin is a good concept the number of potenti applic ar also mani with these start point and with larg develop budget financ primarili with govern fund worldwid develop wa begun worldwid nearli 10 billion kronor have been invest to try to commerci the technolog when access to fund for develop project wa good increasingli more peopl becam interest in the stirl engin develop and the qualiti of certain compani mai be question the submarin concept wa includ earli on but other potenti applic took over primarili applic for vehicl and the gener of energi becaus thi wa where the largest subsidi were few develop project were abl to demonstr technic econom gain with the stirl engin on potenti commerci applic exist in the energi field the solar concentr here there were financi incent for continu a high degre of effici for the solar concentr combin with high energi cost with continu high energi price in the unit state thi system would like have been commerci on a larg scale within a few year calcul show that it wa financi defens if larg scale engin product were start at thi time there wa also a certain market pressur in the unit state as for submarin the stirl engin offer major advantag in the larg high technolog system which submarin repres cost is of lower rank import kockum interest in stirl engin is princip in the opportun to offer more uniqu solut for submarin than those of it competitor the technic breakthrough for the stirl engin within a veri special field submarin ha arriv but to us thi to state that the technolog ha been commerci is go to far commerci us of the technolog for other applic is possibl under veri specif framework condit name high energi price or uniqu technic requir need it wa these framework condit which were not taken into account when the develop wa at it most intens dure the 1970 s potenti applic area were envis and the idea of the technolog wa appeal the framework condit were rel static and a chang such as the energi price level alter the pictur complet over a short period market the concept on a larg scale is like to requir the fulfil of on or more of the follow factor new product technolog which enabl more ration and thu cheaper product new cheaper materi which in a better wai can cope with high temperatur and the complex transfer and conduct of heat larg product volum which in turn requir a market of cours 7 fiberopt technolog in the telecommun network the principl for conduct light with fiberopt wa describ as earli as the begin of the 1900 s howev the basi of fiberopt commun is consid to be an articl in the proceed of iee 1966 two british research c k kao and g a hockham both activ at itt analyz the reason for the high attenu at that time in optic fiber for imag transmiss about 1 000 db km and predict that on should be abl to achiev a valu of about 20 db km if suffici pure glass could be produc fiber with attenu valu at thi low level should then also becom interest for commun purpos the us fiberglass manufactur corn took up the idea and in 1970 fiber with attenu below 20 db km were produc corn s success were the begin of fiber with ever decreas attenu todai normal attenu valu ar below 0 25 db km with a wavelength of 1 550 nm there wa rel agreement in the telecommun industri in the earli 1970 s that thi new technolog would have the possibl of drastic chang the telecommun of the futur it wa believ that the technolog had the follow potenti advantag among other larg bandwidth and mani channel per fiber low transmiss loss which result in the possibl of bridg larg distanc without intermedi repeat lower weight and volum compar to other type of telecommun cabl which result in easier instal lower instal cost per kilomet compar to other cabl instal in the earli 1970 s it wa still difficult to produc fiberopt with low attenu industri the develop on the fiber side went rel quickli howev a few larg compani such as at t corn and itt further develop and improv the product technolog and the qualiti of the optic fiber at lm ericsson activ wa begun in the mid 1970 s in the field of fiberopt partli in a group which work with system studi and partli in a group at the materi laboratori which develop the technolog for manufactur fiberopt sievert kabelverk sup 14 began to produc optic cabl dure the late 1970 s the telecommun agenc ha monitor the field extens sinc the earli 1970 s and a larg number of futur possibl for the technolog were seen for sweden and the swedish telecommun grid commerci howev the technolog wa not matur a rel rapid develop of fiber took place and there wa continu improv in the fiber develop not until the end of the 1970 s howev wa there a breakthrough for rel cheap fiber with good qualiti in the mid 1970 s sweden wa a world leader in the field of coaxial cabl at the end of the 1950 s as the first instal in the world came a 12 mhz system 2 700 channel per coaxial pair and in the earli 1970 s came the last analog system 60 mhz 10 800 channel per coaxial pair also the first in the world the coaxial expans combin with supplement by radio link had provid a certain overcapac in the network traffic prognos dure the 1970 s were also rel uncertain and the network wa anticip to grow at onli a moder pace at the telecommun agenc no need wa seen to introduc optic technolog on a larg scale at least not within the near futur there wa howev long rang plan for modern of the telecommun network at the telecommun agenc invest plan up to the year 2010 were avail these plan includ optic instal test with optic technolog were carri out for strateg reason plan for the test wa undertaken as earli as 1977 and in 1979 the telecommun agenc carri out test with fiberopt between for exampl the telephon station at fredhal and appelviken in stockholm sievert kabelwerk wa on of the supplier of cabl at the system level the telecommun agenc and ericsson cooper the telecommun agenc itself took care of the instal seen from an intern perspect sweden wa far from first the first test in the telecommun field were done as earli as 1976 77 the telecommun agenc began instal optic cabl in 1982 to begin with fiberopt of the multimod type were instal with certain physic characterist it wa princip the grid between the local station in stockholm goteborg and to some extent malmo which were upgrad and modern with fiberopt sinc 1984 85 the telecommun agenc ha instal about 2 500 kilomet of optic cabl sup 15 per year after 1984 85 the instal encompass mainli the long distanc network after 1985 onli fiber of the singl mode type were instal with differ physic characterist than multimod fiber among them higher signal transmiss capabl todai in 1991 about 16 000 kilomet of fiberopt have been instal in the swedish grid the next step in the develop will be optic cabl in the local network modern and upgrad of the local metropolitan grid todai take place to a larg extent us fiberopt fiberopt system for industri applic have never attract the same attent howev the reason for thi is that it is expens sometim it can be justifi howev for instanc if uniqu requir such as resist to interfer exist or if larg volum of data must be transmit in the energi field it mai be mention that fiberopt can be us in the ground line in power cabl fiberopt can then be us for rapid transmiss of inform such as control the network such a power line ha been instal in sweden in the vicin of forsmark for an overhead cabl portion of the power connect between sweden and finland fiberopt develop ha also been of import for digit telecommun system the introduct of digit transmiss system began in sweden in the earli 1970 s thi wa also not a field in which sweden wa an intern pioneer toward the end of the 1970 s digit switch equip and station were introduc while the link were still larg analog in the earli 1980 s the connect also began to be digit first by equip free coaxial pair in exist coaxial cabl then with newli instal optic cabl the telecommun agenc and ericsson undertook partial joint develop of the digit system for public telecommun primarili in the switch area the ax develop the telecommun agenc and ericsson cooper intim for a long time among other thing thei jointli own the ellemtel develop corpor around 1983 84 came a break in the trend in the telecommun field in sweden from an annual growth in traffic of 1 2 percent it increas to 5 6 percent the reason were mani a strong increas in the data traffic it grew by 30 percent annual which in turn wa due to the definit breakthrough of comput in busi and administr the intern and long distanc traffic increas in the 1980 s busi and industri becam highli internation the servic societi wa also strengthen which increas telephon traffic an alter attitud toward telephon ha been perceiv dure the 1980 s younger gener regard the telephon as someth natur and thu us the telephon to a larger extent the rate of increas in telephon traffic ha been about four percent a year after 1984 85 which repres a major increas in absolut number in recent year new telephon servic as well as the fax have also undergon a strong expans the break with the trend in 1983 84 wa rel unexpect the prognos indic an increas but not as fast and sudden at the same time demand were rais for more reliabl and access in the telecommun system which result in reserv capac have to be built into the system it wa realiz quit soon that the overcapac in the grid from the late 1970 s had been us up plan were therefor made for continu high traffic growth for the rest of the 1980 s and in order to assur high access and secur in the network thi had the result that the joint line grid wa expand by 12 15 percent annual optic technolog wa econom superior to other technolog in cost per channel in the mid 1980 s a digit channel with fiberopt cost onli on fourth of what an analog coaxial channel cost in the mid 1970 s the telecommun agenc began market the digitalen 87 project which involv introduct of a nationwid digit network in 1987 it wa inaugur at the end of 1987 as the first in the world sum correspond to 7 8 billion kronor a year at current price were invest by the telecommun agenc in the network part of it wa fiberopt accord to the riksdag decis on new financi rule etc for the telecommun agenc and it subsidiari after 1985 all extern capit acquisit by the group exclus of it broadcast activ wa financ through borrow in the gener credit market thi ha also influenc the size of the invest becaus it becam easier for the agenc to get financ invest could be undertaken at a more rapid pace the larg invest for a few year in the 1980 s which involv digit the long distanc network caus sweden to have an earli lead internation summar analysi the theoret insight that fiberopt technolog is a superior technolog for telecommun came late not until the 1960 s with research at itt and corn on of the major fiberglass manufactur that is to sai a compani which did not at that time have the profil of a telecommun enterpris when fiber technolog becam commerci avail at the end of the 1970 s mani commun administr had overinvest and saw no need for new capac in the near futur test activ with fiberopt wa carri out on a small scale howev as a kind of strateg monitor dure the 1970 s the digit of the public telecommun system also began on a rel small scale start with the switch equip and later with transmiss as well digit technolog wa particularli suit for us in optic system dure the first half of the 1980 s there occur a chang in the growth trend all over the world sweden for exampl had had growth of 1 2 percent a year which grew to 5 6 percent a year major invest in the network were requir in order to cope with thi growth and to achiev a high level with regard to avail and oper reliabl digit technolog and optic technolog had becom commerci avail dure that period with these technolog it wa possibl to achiev higher capac and qualiti per invest amount digit technolog and optic technolog met the requir of the market for modern telecommun dure a period when new invest in commun network were necessari which result in a rapid breakthrough todai the optic technolog repres the de facto standard for long distanc telecommun the develop of fiberopt is take place at the major cabl and fiber manufactur there ar onli a few in the world todai fiberopt itself ha becom a standard compon todai it is more correct to regard fiberopt technolog as a complet system technolog of which fiberopt is onli a part it mai be note that the idea around fiberopt ar not swedish and that the earli develop of fiberopt wa not to ani major extent done in sweden when the fiber becam commerci avail a major effort wa undertaken in thi countri howev and sweden becam a lead nation as regard fiberopt in the network thi show that it is possibl to adopt technolog develop elsewher and becom a leader by mean of major invest 8 mobil telephon the develop of mobil telephon or more correctli cellular analog mobil telephon took place dure the 1980 s at a rate which exceed all prognos and caus a strong expans of the capac of the network at least from a histor perspect mobil telephon will be regard as on of the most success technolog of the 1980 s commerci cellular mobil telephon network open in japan in 1979 in the nordic countri in 1981 in australia in 1981 in the unit state in 1984 and in great britain in 1985 todai august 1991 there ar 13 3 million subscrib in the world 1 2 million of whom ar in the nordic countri and 550 000 in sweden the telecommun agenc s prognos for the penetr of mobil telephon in sweden wa 50 000 subscrib after 10 year sweden and the nordic countri ar todai world leader in cellular mobil telephon technolog with player such as ericsson and nokia as system supplier and termin manufactur and the telecommun agenc and it nordic counterpart as oper test of radio recept in car were initi as earli as the 1920 s the polic forc in the unit state us thi method to direct polic car an acceler factor is like to have been the gangster chase of the 1920 s in the 1930 s test with land mobil radio began in sweden as well here as well the polic were the first dure the year immedi after world war ii the us of land mobil radio spread rapidli thi wa to a larg extent becaus of the technic develop dure the war at the end of the 1940 s the then telegraph administr decid to undertak test activ with car telephon some calcul show that manual traffic involv consider personnel cost and the develop work wa aim at an automat network thi network came to be the first complet autom mobil telephon network in the world the radio equip wa deliv by svenska radio ab a subsidiari of lm ericsson the system stai in servic until 1969 and had slightli more than 100 subscrib at that time it had local coverag in stockholm and goteborg in the mid 1950 s the develop of yet anoth system began the offici start of thi system wa in 1965 but test had been under wai for some year thi system had coverag area in stockholm goteborg and malmo in the 1950 s and 1960 s the know how about radio telephon grew at the telecommun agenc and at the radio laboratori at the same rate as the increas automobil traffic a need wa perceiv in the late 1960 s for a mobil telephon system with greater rang which even made commun possibl between the nordic countri in 1969 the telecommun agenc inform it nordic counterpart that it wa begin to work with the next gener of mobil telephon system it wa long rang work and a complet system could hardli be finish befor the end of the 1970 s further it would be of major advantag if a similar servic could be achiev in the other nordic countri a work group with repres of the telecommun administr of sweden denmark finland and norwai wa appoint with the task of work out joint specif for a futur autom mobil telephon system the work group wa given the name of nmt the nordic mobil telephon group the lead part of the nmt group wa the swedish telecommun agenc the cost share by the nmt group wa base on the number of telephon in each countri which caus the telecommun agenc to be respons for half of the cost anoth aspect that should be mention is that the cost for specif and subsequ develop could be reduc if more parti were involv thi part wa not insignific the nmt group began to specifi an automat mobil telephon system which wa to oper in the 450 mhz band at the same time demand began to be rais for an interim solut in the form of a manual system befor the automat nmt system had been complet specifi develop and test in the earli 1970 s an interim manual mobil telephon system wa therefor put into oper thi system becam known as mtd and also oper in the 450 mhz band on reason for thi wa that there wa a certain amount of custom pressur for mobil telephon primarili outsid the larg metropolitan region anoth wa that market the manual system wa good for becom accustom to mobil telephon which could provid the automat system with a fly start at it largest the mtd system had 19 000 subscrib the system wa gradual abolish dure the 1980 s the nmt group wa provid continu inform to the nordic industri about it work the industri also had opportun to comment on the nmt group s work and to submit viewpoint in 1975 a system specif draft wa readi that same year the nordic telecommun administr decid to develop the system by their work with the system the nmt group had acquir detail knowledg which could be transfer although not without consider work to the industri in the form of specif the start point for the construct wa determin to be a number of basic requir which were believ to meet the futur subscrib demand adequ and the technic and econom precondit the special function which permit call up a mobil subscrib without the need to know where he is is call roam and is made possibl by the fact that a mobil station which leav a cover area for a base radio station and enter a new on automat report thi to the switch station further dure a convers it mai happen that a mobil subscrib get outsid the area of coverag for the base station in which the convers is take place the move result in poorer convers qualiti the qualiti is check by mean of a monitor signal these special function were technic complic in the mid 1970 s the ax 13 exchang from lm ericsson wa a potenti altern as earli as a year or so later the first ax exchang wa put into oper and thi type of exchang can be equip with modul which can execut the exchang function of the mobil telephon the choic of exchang therefor fell to ax thi exchang wa not intend in it origin function to be us for radio telephon becaus of the modular composit it wa possibl to equip ax with a radio portion with certain modif in 1977 a test system wa instal in the stockholm region in order to verifi that the rel complic signal function reliabl extens test were carri out with thi system for a few year the specif were adjust a number of time and not until 1978 wa the contract sign for purchas of exchang and base radio station the nmt system wa put into servic in the four nordic countri in 1981 in sweden nmt achiev more or less nation coverag as earli as the end of 1983 the same appli to denmark in finland and norwai onli the southern part of the countri had been cover by the end of 1983 but on the other hand these part ar the most popul all develop prognos for the number of subscrib were exceed and as earli as 1983 84 capac problem began to occur in the major citi primarili stockholm as a mean of increas the capac the introduct of small cellular technolog began which make it possibl for each frequenc to be util more effici in stockholm such a system wa put into oper in 1985 it wa onli a temporari solut howev capac problem occur rel soon again small cellular technolog wa a part of the system descript at an earli stage howev at the end of 1986 a new system wa put into oper which wa base on the same technic principl but work in the 900 mhz band which meant shorter rang but more channel per frequenc compar to the nmt 450 system just a few year later the rate of increas wa higher in nmt 900 than in nmt 450 the area of coverag for nmt 900 wa limit to the major citi and princip road the area of coverag ha gradual increas and todai the greater part of sweden is cover nmt 900 ha not receiv the same breakthrough in the other nordic countri howev up to 1988 most of the mobil telephon sold were mount in vehicl after 1988 more and more non vehicl mount termin have been sold so call pocket telephon or more commonli yuppi teddi bear the real expans came with the arriv of the pocket telephon in 1990 more than 130 000 telephon were sold in sweden half of which were pocket telephon the pocket telephon can onli be us with nmt 900 the price for them ha drop from about 25 000 kronor in 1988 to 12 000 15 000 kronor todai and ar still drop the develop of the number of mobil telephon in sweden is shown in figur 1 not includ it should also be mention in thi connect that kinnevik own comvik ha been oper a cellular mobil telephon network in the 450 mhz band sinc 1981 todai it ha about 15 000 subscrib in it system which is the number for which there is space in the frequenc rang comvik ha been alloc todai the mobil telephon system ar also in the begin of digit agreement ha been reach in europ on a common standard gsm group system mobil gsm oper in the 900 mhz band larg develop sum have been spent on gsm project in europ test activ is under wai todai in most european countri develop of digit system is also under wai in the unit state and japan but not accord to the gsm standard as for gsm the nordic countri ar not like to becom the lead on larg amount ar be invest in countri such as germani great britain and franc where there is a lack of well develop analog system in the nordic countri there ar well function analog system and demand for digit system will not be made by the market at least not within the next few year on the supplier side ericsson is todai the leader in the market with about 40 percent of the world s subscrib us system deliv by ericsson throughout the 1980 s ericsson succeed in hold on to thi market share although the develop ha been explos sinc the mid 1980 s the number of subscrib ha more or less doubl each year it is even more remark that in the unit state ericsson is bigger than motorola if on count the number of subscrib coupl to the respect supplier system the know how in the radio field exist earli on at svenska radio ab which at that time wa a subsidiari of lm ericsson the nmt group s choic of lm ericsson as a supplier of exchang for the nmt system gave the compani a few year lead over it competitor and is like to have been a contribut factor for ericsson s posit as world leader todai some develop of the radio modul for ax also took place at the develop corpor ellemtel jointli own by ericsson and the telecommun agenc summar analysi from the aspect of the futur system there wa a custom will to take risk the telecommun agenc which start a larg project with a rel poor foundat for the wai the futur market might develop the agenc s prognos for the nmt system were not made until the earli 1980 s and indic 50 000 subscrib after 10 year which turn out to be a major prognosi failur these prognos were base on the increas when it wa as it largest of the mtd system and no in depth analys of market demand were made there were idea about how it would function technic it should be point out here that the expertis at the radio laboratori wa the foundat for the technic principl a well develop technic specif wa then work out in which sever parti particip there wa further at least on major supplier which domin both the radio and telephon technolog of the countri ericsson the cooper between the telecommun agenc and ericsson goe far back in time and ha been good the extens activ involv the specif and develop of the system dure the 1970 s then gave the nordic countri advantag and the nordic compani abov all a lead in comparison with their competitor and thi is on of the reason for ericsson s success in the field it turn out that there wa clearli a need for mobil telephon in the countri the reason for thi ar mani but the on to be stress ar that the system wa user friendli and that it could larg be us the same wai as ordinari telephon in addit access is increas with mobil telephon which is also shown in that most mobil telephon ar found among small and medium size enterpris it mai be mention that mechan repairmen electrician etc ar a major user group seen from an intern perspect thi is like to be quit uniqu in other countri the mobil telephon ha mostli at least so far been us at the execut level in compani and organ the fact that the system is nation and not local as most of the system in the unit state make it possibl further to increas access there is no need to worri about where the subscrib is in the late 1980 s the number of subscrib grew sharpli although the increas wa higher in percent dure the first year of the 1980 s factor which might have affect the increas have been that the person cost to the individu ha been so low and to some extent could be regard as a wage benefit own a pocket telephon in the late 1980 s mai also have been regard as a statu symbol in mani case the increas in the number of new subscrib drop at the end of 1990 and 1991 the decreas ha not been as sharp as other activ in the countri from 12 000 15 000 new subscrib a month at the end of 1989 and earli 1990 a decreas ha occur to about 10 000 new subscrib each month the reason for thi ar partli the economi partli that the market is begin to be satur telecommun in gener turn out to be less sensit to econom fluctuat than other activ which is also demonstr by the mobil telephon develop over the most recent year final the price of servic ha been stabl connect fee subscrib charg and rate have drop in real term over the 10 year the system have been in oper the cost of termin ha also declin sharpli from about 25 000 kronor for an nmt 450 termin in the earli 1980 s to about 5 000 8 000 kronor todai at current price as for pocket telephon thei have drop from about 25 000 kronor in 1988 to 12 000 15 000 kronor todai at current price although the cost sensit is

16 power industri to new regul for so sup x no sub x emiss the energi situat the western german gross product of electr power in 1989 amount to 440 twh in which nuclear power produc 34 percent and hard coal and soft coal nearli 50 percent oil and natur ga account for anoth few percent of the power product the total western german fossil fuell power capac is about 38 000 mw in the 1960 s the share of oil in the product of electr power grew after the first oil crisi in 1973 74 howev the proport of oil decreas in the 1970 s nuclear power wa also introduc and todai it produc a consider part of the power natur ga also began to be us for electr product dure the 1970 s natur ga is mainli us for heat howev power product base on hard coal ha also grown sinc the 1970 s which wa chiefli due to the mean of control util by the state the domest hard coal is expens to mine on wai of protect the domest hard coal industri ha been for the power produc to receiv cash compens for their higher cost when us domest hard coal the cash is taken from special fund which have been establish by ad a certain percentag to the cost of electr call kohlepfennig coal pfennig which repres an averag of eight percent of the price of power the size of the surcharg vari somewhat between the variou laender in 1980 the power produc sup 17 and the hard coal industri sign a 15 year busi agreement which is known as the jahrhundertvertrag centuri agreement in practic the result of the agreement ha been that further expans of all other type of power product ha ceas at the expens of power product base on hard coal in the latter part of the 1980 s the instal capac of the hard coal plant ha been expand or is expect to expand in the next few year by about 5 000 mw when the agreement wa made the annual increas in gross electr power consumpt wa 3 5 percent while the increas in the late 1980 s wa about on percent a year and is expect to stai at an averag of on percent a year until the year 2000 todai there is no room for either oil or ga fire power plant the construct of which furthermor requir special permiss in accord with the law on electr power product nuclear power is not go to be ad to either there is also some doubt about nuclear power for exampl the social democrat parti congress spd in 1986 decid to abolish nuclear power within 10 year if the parti come into power the import of coal in particular hard coal for the energi system is import to stress the entri of the environment issu and the environment legisl the environment debat got under wai in earnest at the end of the 1970 s in a rel short time it achiev a firm anchor in the countri the green die gruenen enter sever of the laender parliament as well as the bundestag in 1983 increasingli more frequent and threaten report about

to be critic as well what trigger the tighten and revis of the feder law that ha taken place in the 1980 s wa mainli the debat about forest damag in the earli 1980 s studi were undertaken which show that up to 50 percent of the forest wa damag and about half of the damag forest displai seriou damag although there wa a lack of strict scientif proof in some situat most expert agre that the emiss did plai a major role in western germani all air qualiti issu ar regul by a framework law call the bund immiss schutzgesetz bimschg of 1974 the framework law then includ a number of ordin verordnungen which have been continu expand tighten and revis dure the 1970 s and 1980 s furthermor there ar addit direct and recommend at the laender level which in mani case involv further tighten of the feder legisl in north rhine westphalia for exampl air qualiti matter ar regul in a consider stricter manner than in other laender the articl which regul emiss into the air includ hundr of page and even expert believ that it is difficult to acquir complet understand of the entir system the ordin which ha been of major import for the develop dure the 1980 s is gfavo grossfeueranlagenverordnung or 13 bimschv origin from 1983 but further tighten after 1983 thi ordin regul limit sup 18 for emiss of so sup 2 and no sup x from combust in facil with more than 50 mw thermal output after juli 1983 the standard for so sup 2 emiss were set at 400 mg per m sup 3 dry stack ga volum at 5 percent o sup 2 content for a coal fire facil with 300 mw thermal output in addit measur must have been undertaken for a stack ga desulfur of at least 85 percent the standard for no sup x emiss were set in juli 1983 at 800 mg per m sup 3 for facil in oper in novemb 1983 the no sup x level were reduc to 400 mg per m sup 3 and in april 1984 to 200 mg per m sup 3 for all facil the reason for thi sharp cutback wa primarili that there were function techniqu in japan which could work at these level yet anoth ordin which ha been revis in the 1980 s and ha influenc the situat is ta luft technisch anleitung zur reinhaltung der luft or a supplement to 1 bimschv from 1986 it regul emiss of no sup x from combust in

april 1993 or be close down the environment goal of the umweltbundesamt uba the german equival of the natur conserv board were that between the year 1982 and 1993 the so sup 2 emiss from power plant should be reduc by 75 percent and no sup x emiss should have drop by 70 percent by the earli 1990 s furthermor western germani wa on of the member of the so call 30 percent club mean the nation which sign a convent involv a cutback of so sup 2 emiss by 30 percent by 1993 the refer year wa 1980 western germani went further than that howev and promis a reduct of 60 percent gfavo regul emiss level for a total of about 1 500 furnac both thermal and electr power and ta luft regul emiss level for a total of 50 000 furnac mainli heat the technolog develop of ga purif in gener mai be said that publicli fund research and develop in thi field ha been consider the organ which earli on support research and develop of desulfur wa the uba publicli fund pilot facil for partial desulfur had alreadi been built in the late 1960 s invest support measur have also been util sinc 1975 it ha been possibl to write off environment invest more advantag than other invest in the late 1970 s invest support program for modern old plant were also initi altanlagensanierungsprogram the program had a budget of 560 billion german mark dm from 1979 87 and a larg part of alloc fund were us for so sup 2 purif the burner were also further develop in the 1970 s and lower emiss valu could be achiev primarili for no sup x with modif of the burner in the follow it is import to distinguish between the develop of so sup 2 purif and no sub x purif sinc their technolog develop ha been differ so sup 2 the origin techniqu for so sup 2 purif ar both german and foreign primarili us but the techniqu have been further develop in western germani public fund wa clearli of signific in the legisl the concept stand der technik is us by that is meant that the technolog avail at each point in time is to be us it take more than five year from receipt of an order by a supplier until the facil is in oper approv and transfer after that time the stand der technik is at a differ level thi ha had the result for exampl that sinc the 1970 s the power plant industri ha requir the supplier of new or ad facil not to emit more than half the amount of so sup 2 prescrib in the permit agreement the result of appli the stand der technik wa that the refer facil built in west germani in the 1970 s met the gfavo 1983 standard for so sup 2 even when put into servic the technolog for so sup 2 wa larg develop even when the gfavo regul began to take effect thi is shown in figur 1 not includ about 15 percent of the capac of fossil fuell plant in fact had desulfur devic as earli as the end of 1983 by the end of 1988 165 stack ga desulfur facil had been instal and put into oper at 72 differ power plant nearli 90 percent of the facil ar a type of wet scrubber with lime or limeston as absorb and with gypsum as end product about

product drop by 75 percent to 250 000 ton year achiev result and cost a common statement regard west germani s environment invest in the 1980 s wa that no countri ha over such a short time accomplish such major environment improv on the other hand no countri ha invest so much in environment improv measur as west germani invest for so sup 2 purif between the year 1983 and 1988 amount to dm 14 billion at current price and for no sup x purif between 1985 and 1991 to dm 7 billion at current price the total invest convert into swedish currenc at an exchang rate of 3 6 kronor ar 75 billion kronor the cost for the desulfur program total the equival of 1 3 million kronor per instal mw and the de no sup x program ha cost the equival of 0 8 million kronor per instal mw from 1983 to 1988 so sup 2 emiss from power plant drop by 80 percent and from 1985 to 1991 no sup x emiss fell 75 percent which must be regard as veri remark cut sinc govern invest contribut have been given to a rel minor extent the german power consum have mostli had to pai for these environment improv by wai of their electr bill accord to a studi conduct by the vdew vereinigt deutsch elektrizitaet werk organ the

author thi gigant invest program wa control by tighten the legisl princip the gfavo ordin which took effect in 1983 84 even befor gfavo took effect about 15 percent of the fossil fuell power product had modern desulfur technolog howev the technolog develop of desulfur technolog occur larg in the 1970 s partli with govern fund the technolog wa therefor up to date and there wa also no lack of refer facil then when the desulfur program wa initi on a larg scale alreadi known technolog wa util the develop of no sup x purif look differ no sup x enter the environment debat later and it introduct ha

grew dure the 1980 s and partli becaus the price for electr despit be high nevertheless repres a small part of the total household cost electr price in germani have further seen from a histor perspect alwai been higher than in the rest of the world industri ha not be hit as hard perhap the electr intens industri ha special agreement valid for long period and the electr tariff have probabl not been influenc to ani major extent by thi the larg german mechan engin industri is also not particularli sensit to the price level for electr power sinc it onli amount to a few percent of the process valu it should also be ad that the requir by the author have been strict and that industri ha had to adapt the public influenc dure the 1980 s in thi case by wai of legisl did not bring the technolog much further as regard desulfur technolog the techniqu were known and verifi the legisl forc the invest howev as for de no sup x techniqu there were japanes licens agreement which had been bought to be

which ha turn out to be veri success the goal that were establish were achiev and even exceed in some situat the legisl had the opposit effect howev mean it wa an obstacl to new energi technolog the legisl which impli that the best possibl techniqu must be us mean that on is forc to instal the new technolog in sever place thi could in some situat have inhibit the develop the german model ha also to a major extent been to attach purif equip not to improv the combust process but on should bear in mind the seriou environment situat in which west germani found itself in the earli 1980 s the strong measur ultim taken by the govern were perhap the onli correct wai to deal with or at least improv a seriou environment situat over a rel short period 3 bioenergi in sweden background in 1973 dramat price increas and disturb of the intern oil trade occur the situat wa felt in sweden as well becaus of the countri s major depend on oil and becaus ration wa undertaken the first oil crisi wa a fact the oil crisi becam the start point for an extens energi research program which wa begun in 1975 when the second oil crisi occur in 1979 the alloc of fund to the energi program wa intensifi financi subsidi of invest in energi technolog aim at rapidli reduc the depend on oil were introduc the oil replac fund establish in 1981 acquir a central role part of the oil replac program wa the intent to convert from oil to biofuel sup 19 the oil replac polici with special emphasi on biofuel in 1974 the energi program committe epk wa of the opinion that biofuel would plai a veri limit role in the futur it posit wa that wood and timber wast product ar not an attract fuel under normal condit sinc forest product have a far higher valu as a raw materi for fiber energi forest cultiv could be undertaken on a limit scale howev so that the interest of the forest industri would not be threaten the need for research wa evalu as minor and research in the field wa given 3 million kronor annual over a three year period in the first energi polici program of 1975 bioenergi is regard as on altern among mani in the new energi sector here as well it wa believ that bioenergi would have littl signific after the nonsocialist govern came to power in 1976 the import of bioenergi wa clearli mark bioenergi wa given greater import in the 1977 78 energi draft bill and the fund alloc for research were more than doubl then energi minist olof johansson said at the time biomass is in my opinion on of the most interest altern against that background i believ that consider research and develop effort involv energi extract from biomass ar justifi the goal of these effort should be to develop foundat for evalu the opportun to increas the proport of biomass in the swedish energi system and for support the develop of such new technolog as is necessari in order to util the energi content of biomass it wa not onli the replac of oil which wa the reason for thi major interest in biofuel it wa also import for the center parti to find credibl altern to nuclear power in the 1978 79 energi bill submit by the liber minor govern but gener base on the nonsocialist three parti govern s foundat materi new guidelin for the energi polici ar present it sai here forest wast and hardwood qualiti which ar not need for the forest industri ar a domest and renew sourc of energi which should be serious taken into account when plan the futur energi suppli it should be possibl to introduc the technolog on a larg scale even dure the 1980s new guidelin for energi polici were present in the 1980 81 energi bill there wa still major uncertainti about the bioenergi field but the goal prognos had been adjust upward compar to earlier prognos and correspond to 25 30 twh per year for forest fuel exclus of forest energi us of lye bark etc addit increas were expect after 1990 when the energi forest program would begin to take effect a larg number of effort were aim at the develop of method and technolog for the product and us of biofuel the energi polici did not take just oil replac into account howev the decis to abolish nuclear power by 2010 wa also includ on of the precondit for the 1980 81 energi polici decis wa the assumpt that oil price would continu to climb in real term by two percent a year for all of the 1980 s thi could be perceiv as a prognosi for the most like develop of the oil price which in turn gener a certain volum for the oil replac it could also be seen as a necessari price develop for the oil replac to achiev the plan volum the assumpt of increas oil price in real term had the result that compar calcul for variou fuel favor the latter an addit measur which reinforc the introduct of biofuel wa the solid fuel law which meant that facil that burn the equival of 5 000 m sup 3 of thick fuel oil annual must be design so that without major remodel work or supplement thei can burn domest solid fuel doe not appli to area where distribut of natur ga wa plan howev subsidi for invest in oil replac technolog were provid through the oil replac fund subsidi could also be given for establish market organ for domest fuel the fund wa financ by a surcharg on oil and

opportun to us the forest raw materi in energi product a certain rivalri thu exist between the forest industri on the on hand and those who want to us the forest as raw materi for energi on the other the contribut from research dure thi period wa consider with regard to forest mainten and cut but more limit with regard to refin fuel the project had a budget of about 20 million kronor half of which wa govern fund and half from the forest industri when the second oil crisi occur in 1979 the price relationship chang rapidli in favor of domest fuel not just by calcul but also in real term there wa also no conflict with the forest industri concern raw materi partli due to the fact that it wa mostli forest wast that wa to be util and partli becaus the forest industri had been hit by a slump that the govern wa more interest in establish a market among other thing therefor came to be an acceler factor the view of biofuel particularli forest fuel as an econom reason altern and supplement becam more favor and the us of biofuel for heat purpos increas rapidli howev no commerci link had had time to develop and the us of forest fuel outsid the forest industri wa thu limit up to thi period when

not quit 1 million hectar cultiv test show that a product of about 15 ton of dry substanc per hectar and year would be possibl in southern sweden which would be the equival of six ton of oil per hectar and year sinc 1985 when the oil price fell no major effort have been made in the field of energi forest and commerci introduct ha not yet taken place todai there ar about 700 hectar of energi forest in the countri which ar still at the experiment stage in the period 1981 82 to 1983 84 the forest fuel area exclus of energi forest wa given 145 million kronor 40 million kronor of which were for larg scale experi and anoth 40 million kronor for combust technolog which also includ burn other solid fuel peat wast etc the object of thi program wa to elimin the obstacl which exist for the introduct of forest fuel on a larg scale what wa seen wa a begin commerci of biofuel the goal of the oil replac program which wa establish in the earli 1980s wa for coal domest fuel and convers to electr to be respons for replac about 9 mtoe not further identifi in 1990 as earli as 1985 the oil replac would amount to 3 5 mtoe dure the period 1981 84 the oil replac fund grant invest support in the form of subsidi for variou type of loan for combust facil for solid fuel and fuel product and refin of biofuel of approxim 400 million kronor the total invest cost in these project were about 1 2 billion kronor the number of project amount to nearli 100 of which about half involv prototyp and demonstr facil as earli as the 1970 s howev invest fund wa provid for biofuel facil the activ wa financ by sind state industri administr it merg with the oil replac fund in 1981 dure thi period a number of compani and project were establish some exampl ar pellet product in mora nydo origin own by nyna later by the swedish forest servic and whose purpos wa to establish a commerci link for biofuel and ebenol in vastergotland which produc pulver wood the forest industri wa also involv in project sca built a forest fuel termin in hissmofor and sodra skogsagarna built on in vaxjo dure that period furnac were also construct which could easili be convert to variou fuel in 1983 about 60 major forest fuel fire group center or facil for district heat product were in exist about 15 of them util refin forest fuel such as pulver wood pellet or briquett dure that period the swedish biofuel associ svebio wa also found which ha exercis pressur to promot the develop of the bioenergi field when the oil price drop sharpli in 1985 despit an increas in tax and surcharg on oil the previous made calcul were complet failur mani of the new compani did not have establish market and were not suffici strong financi to cope with the new situat what at on moment appear to be foresight and innov appear to be the most expens altern the next the industri s develop ha definit been affect by the energi polici not mere by the oil price prognos but also by competit from other form of energi which were govern support electr convers is on of them and other solid fuel primarili coal is anoth yet anoth is larg heat pump on more aspect which in some case mai have been inhibit for the biofuel develop but which should not be unduli stress is the wood fiber law from the earli 1970 s accord to it a larg combust plant for wood fuel must be special examin befor receiv permiss for establish the wood fiber law ceas to appli in 1993 howev it is interest to note that the bioenergi industri ha recov after the oil price drop and ha even grown for heat product in municip thermal power plant the reason for thi is that the solid fuel furnac which were instal in recent year have mostli been us for biofuel or were convert from other solid fuel to biofuel the govern s invest support for the facil ha decreas sinc 1985 howev biofuel ar like to be the object of debat in the futur as well howev todai a govern biostudi is under wai whose task is to see how the applic of biofuel can be increas and their competit abil strengthen without conflict with the forest industri the studi is to be complet on 1 juli 1991 summar analysi the swedish energi program from 1975 to 1985 must be regard as integr bioenergi wa onli on of sever new sourc of energi under consider it appear suitabl from a polit point of view howev sinc it wa both domest and renew when the oil price increas sharpli in 1979 and 1980 the oil replac program becam the domin on the oil replac fund which began it activ in 1981 facilit the financ of introduc solid fuel among them biofuel and acquir a central role in biofuel us at the same time as biofuel becam interest primarili from the aspect of replac oil the forest industri met with wors econom condit thi had the result that the forest industri wa more abl to accept the us of forest raw materi as fuel in addit the materi remov at least to begin with involv mainli forest wast shave etc at the end of the 1980 s a conflict between the forest industri and the biofuel industri onc again develop regard the raw materi it should be clear howev that the materi remov from the forest which is to be burn up is rel limit the annual growth of the swedish forest is much greater than the annual remov substanc and in the past 20 year the biofuel industri ha in fact not compet with the forest industri for the raw materi a veri import compon in oil replac wa the govern s prognos for the futur develop of oil price the assumpt wa that the oil price would grow by two percent a year in real term for all of the 1980 s these prognos were produc and accordingli interpret as polit promis the calcul made were base on these polit promis which said that convert from oil to solid fuel among them biofuel would be profit within a period of 5 6 year with expect for a commerci link for biofuel when thei were establish when the oil price fell sharpli in 1985 despit an increas in tax and surcharg on oil the previous made calcul collaps complet the price sensit of the fuel wa too great thi case show that polit steer of econom paramet can have tremend consequ if the free market goe in the direct opposit to the polit econom steer other aspect which have made introduct of biofuel more difficult have been the competit from other form of energi which were also subsid for larg facil convers to coal ha been an altern anoth competitor wa electr convers particularli of electr that could be switch off in absolut number convers to electr that could be switch off wa rel moder but it wa concentr to the size of facil where biofuel ar common the govern s effort in thi field includ subsidi and financi support for facil have total 875 million kronor at current price for the period 1975 90 about 700 million kronor of which wa for the period 1975 85 whether these sum ar justifi or not cannot be unequivoc answer it is like that a develop of know how took place in the field of forest research and in the field of combust which is worth someth on the other hand the subsidi for prototyp and demonstr facil were often base on calcul of higher oil price in real term and a well function market and would probabl not have been built if the calcul had look differ it is interest to note that the us of biofuel for heat product in municip thermal power plant grew in the late 1980 s despit the industri lose strength in the mid 1980 s sever factor mai explain thi the main reason is howev that mani thermal plant with combin furnac believ it make good econom sens to burn biofuel thi appli particularli where there is plenti of forest raw materi indirectli it is due to the govern s mean of control in which biofuel receiv favor tax treatment compar with fossil fuel on fact which is like to be of signific in the futur is that there is a larg surplu of forest and thi surplu is grow from year to year the differ between annual growth and the annual amount remov is on the order of 30 million m sup 3 burn some of the surplu ought to be correct from a nation econom point of view swedish nuclear wast technolog background the role of nuclear power in the swedish energi system wa a veri big polit issu dure the 1970 s and repres on of the big controversi issu in the 1976 elect movement in particular the nuclear wast issu wa discuss and not onli in sweden but in most of the western nation where nuclear power program were under wai the strict legisl which wa enact in the late 1970 s wa in mani respect a reflect of the social debat and the polit debat conduct regard nuclear wast legisl involv wast issu the nonsocialist three parti govern which wa form after the 1976 elect and dissolv in 1978 due to disagr over the nuclear power issu in 1977 submit propos for special permiss to add nuclear fuel to a nuclear reactor in april 1977 the riksdag adopt thi law the so call law of condit nuclear power plant law the law impos demand for special permiss from the govern for ad nuclear fuel to a reactor for the first time so that nuclear fission can take place permiss is onli grant if the reactor s owner ha present an agreement which in a safe manner meet the requir for reprocess spent nuclear fuel and further ha shown each and everi wai to perman store both reprocess and non

which indic that the oil price would continu to rise by about two percent a year calcul in term of real monetari valu for the forese futur the subsidi also meant that some of the invest were move up abov all in 1984 so that it wa possibl to take advantag of it befor it ceas dure the 1970 s there were also rapid shift in attitud thu for some year wood furnac were sold in larg amount after which came electr cartridg and electr cassett and then gradual heat pump these fluctuat were larg due to the form of the govern s contribut and subsidi the state support meant an approv for privat person that societi had confid in the technolog the same happen when the subsidi stop mani felt that thi wa becaus societi regret it invest in heat pump which is why the 1975 slump wa veri steep the municip advis were also import for the major success of the heat pump in the convers market through thi invest support thei had someth concret to offer properti owner beyond good advic and inspect protocol small heat pump new product in thi field as well the govern effort primarili the 1980 build standard have had influenc on the market penetr it ha been about 50 percent for close to a decad now that the develop ha been rel stabl can be explain by the fact that the market space in the new construct segment is not as much as the convers segment govern by the relationship between electr and oil price but also by variat in new product and by the interest of the profession custom group in standard it product the fact that govern subsidi were more stabl dure thi period in the form of the state loan probabl also contribut to the more stabl develop medium size heat pump in gener the same type of support were grant to medium size heat pump as to small heat pump but thi support had a consider lower impact on the develop the incent for the intend custom were usual so minor that thei were not reinforc by subsidi measur to ani signific extent the more profession custom group compar to the convers market probabl impos greater econom and function demand on the instal with the result that the state support did not creat a correspond boom in thi segment when the technolog wa complet and test in practic the favor contribut were no longer avail the govern impact which occur in thi segment can instead mainli be trace to the educ and inform effort which were undertaken these ar like to have had a posit influenc sup 28 on both the number of instal and the qualiti of the instal larg heat pump as wa mention earlier the market introduct in thi segment wa primarili market driven govern effort includ vattenfal s solar project therefor had no decis effect on the develop other than possibl to speed up the introduct somewhat the govern s greatest impact on thi develop is like to have been through it influenc on the oil price develop on the intern market the oil price began to fall in 1982 83 the effect of thi price drop were not notic on the swedish market until 1985 howev becaus higher tax and the rise dollar exchang rate compens for the drop in world market price at the same time the swedish price of electr fell further dure these year in connect with more nuclear power reactor enter product thi develop in which the state wa a princip player further reinforc the competit of big heat pump of cours and acceler their market introduct 6 energi consult at the region develop fund when the govern s effort in the field of energi were initi after the first oil crisi in 1973 74 thei were intend to reduc the countri s depend on oil part of the respons for reduc industri energi consumpt fell to the nation industri administr sind to begin with the effort involv inform and advic on energi conserv measur to small and medium size compani which ar a veri heterogen group the group includ the nation small enterpris and it wa thought that there wa rel littl knowledg of ration energi us within the group which is why it wa consid essenti to inform about energi conserv opportun the energi consult began in 1977 and wa conclud in 1987 dure thi period about 6 500 compani were visit and for more than 3 500 of them a larg survei wa undertaken a so call preliminari inventori sind total appropri dure the period amount to 74 million kronor in todai s price furthermor vattenfal contribut 3 million kronor for the 1986 87 fiscal year the larg alloc of fund took place over the period 1981 82 to 1985 86 an averag of 12 million kronor per fiscal year the orient of the activ vari somewhat over thi period from have had the charact of inform carrier the activ in part chang to includ consult and advic aim at the compani undertak energi save measur and therebi becom more profit in the long run after that follow a period when the compani were help to achiev energi save establish know how and improv oper and mainten etc toward the end of the period the activ wa aim at develop decis materi for energi save which the enterpris themselv can continu from 1977 to 1984 the effort were mostli aim at save oil and in recent year more toward greater electr effici sind particip wa of a coordin natur the actual energi consult wa carri out in part by the energi consult of the develop fund themselv in part by hire consult wherebi the effort were roughli evenli distribut between the fund s own energi consult and hire consult the activ wa primarili free of charg certain attempt at pai for it with fee were made but did not turn out veri well which wa mostli becaus util of consult is low within the group of small and medium size firm and the cost of consult is consid high energi consult at the region develop fund in 1975 sind wa given the task of provid inform about energi save contribut by wai of the enterpris associ a predecessor for the region develop fund fund wa alloc for educ inform and cours in the field of heat the goal wa to reduc oil consumpt over the next two year sind wa charg with provid inform on the potenti for save energi princip for heat but also process orient measur which could save energi the activ wa undertaken in the form of seek out activ an actual target group wa not defin the compani which were interest got help in 1977 the enterpris associ personnel which often consist of energi and vv train civil engin wa train in the subject of energi for three dai after that the right to decid applic for energi conserv subsidi of up to 50 000 kronor wa deleg to the enterpris associ the idea wa to achiev smoother handl of energi conserv fund further in 1977 test were start with a free energi consult in three provinc about 1 000 compani in the three provinc were given energi consult of half or on dai each the activ wa primarili to seek them out the intent wa for these firm then to appli for energi conserv subsidi and thu carri out energi save measur but onli about eight percent of the compani visit appli for energi conserv subsidi within a year in 1978 the free energi consult activ wa expand to includ all provinc in 1978 an industri specif energi consult activ wa also begun there wa cooper with stu administr for technic develop and linkop technic colleg among other the wood product rubber and foundri industri were also target among other rel few compani were visit and the potenti for save energi at the firm visit wa judg at an averag of 20 percent after 1980 a gradual addit of energi consult took place in all provinc in thi phase the activ wa develop to includ an annual budget of 10 15 million kronor the seek out activ continu visit were undertaken which chang into preliminari inventori as to whether a suffici larg energi save potenti could be found visit to individu firm were usual carri out at the initi of the individu compani on the other hand the industri specif survei were activ effort the energi consult also undertook a number of so call special project in which it mai be question in some case whether their task were not outsid the field among other thing thei particip in introduc solid fuel combust and work with issu involv mini power plant and wind power in on exampl the energi consult wa involv in develop and instal of a new type of wind power gener togeth with extern consult pc base program softwar ha been develop for profit calcul of energi budget measur and the develop of certain measur equip such as energi data meter for storag of measur data and an air flow meter for low air speed it wa determin in the 1983 84 budget bill that the activ should continu to the same extent as over the past two year but that the appropri must be reduc attempt at financ with fee were onc again made which work poorli in accord with the previou evalu in 1986 the appropri were sharpli cut back from 13 million kronor for the 1985 86 fiscal year to 4 million kronor for the 1986 87 fiscal year vattenfal contribut 3 million kronor for the 1986 87 fiscal year within the framework of it task 2000 project which is aim at make electr us more effici and reduc the demand for electr power after that the activ ceas when the subsidi were remov the activ larg disappear and todai energi consult remain onli in jonkop provinc anoth few ar left but thei also work with other issu the fact that the activ disappear so quickli wa mainli due to two factor there wa no actual market for these servic and the energi save that can be undertaken todai ar primarili for greater effici so that consider larger resourc ar need both to survei them and to chang them two independ evalu of the activ have been made by siar foundat for research on enterpris administr in 1984 and by af steam boiler associ in 1988 both of them ar of the opinion that the project wa rel success but that on should have concentr on fewer compani in a few industri which would have been interest from the aspect of energi summar analysi the origin idea wa to provid small and medium size compani with inform about energi save measur primarili oil save with inform at hand on would then act ration that is to sai undertak measur to save energi thi did not happen the reason ar mani on of them is that mani small and medium size firm regard the cost of energi as a fix cost and it rare exce two percent of turnov at a mechan engin industri for exampl anoth aspect is that smaller compani ar not alwai organ or recept to detect and undertak potenti save further in mani case these firm have no experi with consult and a servic whose valu cannot be demonstr without be abl to show concret proof of potenti save must be market and sold inform alon wa not suffici to get the industri to save energi although the inform in itself wa good the inform combin with a visit or preliminari inventori would achiev a good result it also turn out that simpl measur with regard to insul ventil industri gate etc achiev consider save primarili oil save in those case where larger and more costli measur were to be carri out the result wa poorer the independ evalu which wa made in 1984 judg the energi conserv potenti in small and medium size enterpris to be 15 20 percent for measur with a payoff time shorter than three year for the entir target group it would give a possibl profit potenti of 5 7 twh year invest with payoff time of up to three year ar probabl too big if the energi cost ar onli a few percent of the total expens in a compani a problem with project of thi type is that it is more difficult to evalu them in econom term becaus it is hard to measur the effect of undertaken measur as an inform campaign for energi save howev the project is like to have been of signific and must be regard as success if thi project wa mere a link in the govern s inform campaign for energi conserv the project succeed well if on the other hand the object were to achiev certain result on should have aim more at rel energi intens industri which is also the opinion of the independ evalu the campaign that were aim at energi intens industri show good result the accept view of the energi sector wa that the effort were effect whether or not the effect correspond to the resourc spent cannot be unequivoc answer on thi point opinion differ 7 effici electr consumpt in the unit state background as earli as the 1970 s certain us power compani on the west coast were forc to rethink their plan for electr power product increas in demand had previous been met by expand product capac in the futur thi would not be quit as easi new invest could often becom so expens that in the long term it would not be possibl to get back the actual cost of produc electr the futur uncertainti in the fuel market primarili the oil market further reinforc that pictur dure the period 1975 82 the price of electr grew veri sharpli by an averag of 15 percent a year in real term opinion oppos to new construct of facil also began to grow and it could be difficult to receiv permit for new construct the legisl in the energi produc field in the unit state is complex and the market is thu tightli regul it ha also taken a long time to complet and put into oper certain of the nuclear power plant which began to be built in the unit state in the 1970 s with these assumpt the power compani ask themselv whether it were not possibl to influenc the demand for electr power thi is how the demand side manag concept or dsm wa born in swedish on could translat dsm as regul the demand for electr power in the 1980 s dsm ha been further develop and spread to the east coast as well todai there ar hundr of dsm program all across the unit state which in variou wai try to affect the demand for electr power accord to the desir profil the dsm concept is also be develop toward a unifi view of energi product in which both econom and environment aspect ar illumin thi further develop is often call integr resourc plan irp dsm ha todai becom gener accept in the unit state and is expect to be need in most state dure the 1990 s the electr power research institut epri a research organ financ by the privat power compani in the unit state is of the opinion that dsm program can reduc the need for electr by up to five percent by the year 2000 and consequ carbon dioxid emiss by up to 5 7 percent on reason for continu implement of dm program in the 1990 s is environment such as carbon dioxid emiss and other emiss with environment impact anoth reason is that mani power compani ar expect to reach or have alreadi reach maximum output dure peak load and by reduc the peak there is no need to invest in new power on think in term of avoid cost the valu of a save kw in a peak load situat can then be great yet anoth aspect is that in mani case dsm ha turn out to involv lower power cost for the custom and it ha therefor work out favor for continu activ in the 1980 s the dsm program mostli includ for exampl energi save measur discount of variou kind which ar aim at util energi save equip load control inform market and in certain case even more far reach cooper between manufactur and supplier regard energi effici equip and technolog dsm program have occur in both the hous sector and the industri sector there ha been great invent the profit of the dm project ha vari due among other thing to the fact that thei were often undertaken for experiment purpos figur 1 not includ show the develop of dsm program from 1977 to 1988 at the end of the 1980 s howev the dsm effort slacken in some state abov all on the west coast on of the reason wa that it ha been advantag to build smaller power plant and sell electr to the regul power compani and therefor there did not seem to be the same need for greater effici as befor on the east coast howev the dsm effort have remain at a high level sinc a lack of power ha threaten the whole time in the last few year dsm ha onc again becom interest from 1989 to 1991 the power compani spend on dsm ha grown from an averag of 1 6 to 2 3 percent of total sale the foremost caus of thi is as wa mention earlier environment reason the possibl of not have to invest in new power and accept from the custom exampl of dsm program in the unit state below ar given some exampl of dsm program undertaken in the unit state dure the 1970 s and 1980 s seattl citi light

number of dsm program in effect in the unit state in the 1970 s and 1980 s is veri larg it is not alwai possibl to find both success and unsuccess program mani of the dsm program have also been undertaken for experiment purpos and ar therefor not alwai relev to evalu at least not in term of profit a common denomin for mani of the program undertaken dure the 1980 s abov all is that the drop in energi us is about 1 2 percent and that the peak output can be reduc by 2 3 percent the power consum have also to a larg extent accept dsm the reason for thi could be that dsm is market as a wai to reduc cost for the custom which it ha also turn out to do in mani case dsm ha also been us as an argument in the environment debat and thi ha further reinforc the accept by electr consum the question to ask from a swedish point of view is why there ha been so rel littl save when the expens for these save have been so larg it should be understood howev that the us power product system is highli limit in output and by trim the output peak there is no need to invest in new power by appli the least cost plan concept the valu of a save kwh or a trim kw at high load can be rel larg in thi wai the purpos of the dsm program ha probabl had an impact at least for some power compani the equival calcul could not simpli be transfer to the swedish power product system where maximum output is veri rare

the emiss level for convent chlorin ga bleach could reach 10 kg aox per ton of pulp in the earli 1970 s oxygen bleach wa introduc as an entir new process step thi reduc the chlorin ga consumpt of the

1970 s impos stricter requir for purif of wast water but did not expressli requir the us of oxygen bleach on wai to clean the wast water although with certain shortcom wa aerat pond initi the natur conserv board often requir aerat pond the industri itself came up with the counter propos of oxygen bleach oxygen bleach is a part of the process and in addit to reduc the emiss of organochlorin

consumpt from 1970 and on thi ha declin after the 1970 s although product of bleach pulp ha continu grown the primari reason for thi is the introduct of oxygen bleach other process improv and addit purif step have also contribut to a reduct of the emiss level in the mid 1980 s the emiss level from a convent chlorin bleach plant without oxygen bleach wa 5 8 kg aox per ton of pulp with oxygen bleach it wa reduc to 3 4 kg aox per ton of pulp a continu reduct of emiss of organochlorin compound measur in aox ha taken place over the entir period sinc 1970 see figur 2 not includ in 1987 the forest industri believ that anoth reduct to a level on the order of 2 5 kg aox per ton of pulp would be technic possibl in the earli 1990 s the govern went even further in the 1988 environment bill howev here the target for emiss from bleach plant ar state the forest industri is to have begun measur to reduc the emiss level to 1 5 kg aox per ton of pulp no later than 1992 the goal is then to achiev 0 5 kg of aox per ton of pulp in the earli 2000 s the swedish forest industri agre with the govern and author that in the long term the emiss must be further reduc what thei did not agre on wa the rate of reduct and the opportun for influenc the competitor nation the problem of reduc emiss of organochlorin compound ar consider from the aspect of both invest and technolog the develop ha gone faster than what the forest industri believ in 1987 howev in principl the technolog is readi but untest on a larg scale against that background the forest industri did not dare promis to reduc the emiss level so drastic over such a short period in the mid 1980 s the environment debat in societi intensifi the environment debat about the forest industri in sweden larg came to involv organochlorin compound the reason for thi wa among other thing the alarm report from the unit state about trace of chlorin dioxin and furan from wast dump similar trace were also found in connect with pulp factori it wa modern analyt technolog which made the discoveri of thi possibl a debat about chlorin bleach pulp product develop it wa possibl to determin dioxin trace in diaper for exampl the so call diaper debat wa conduct primarili in the unit state and western europ when the dioxin debat reach sweden the forest industri s environment problem were focus on organochlorin compound in sweden there were also trace of chlorin dioxin found in some place for exampl in crab outsid varo mill in kattegat the dioxin debat wa on reason to formul the target for sharp reduct of aox compound in the 1988 environment bill the intensifi environment debat also to a larg extent influenc the content of the environment bill in connect with expans and new invest invest have been made in modern environment equip and technolog or the permit would not have been approv due to the rapid rate of expans in the industri throughout the 1980 s it ha been possibl to introduc new technolog with less environment impact the total environ relat invest sinc 1968 amount to more than 12 billion kronor at todai s price which is the equival of between 10 and 20 percent of total invest until todai all the sulfat factori with bleach facil have been oblig by the concess administr to reduc their emiss to a level of about 1 5 kg aox per ton of pulp in some permit the emiss level were somewhat higher in other somewhat lower most of the mill todai ar alreadi below or have propos measur for reach level below 1 5 kg aox per ton of pulp todai the forest industri ha succeed in a veri favor wai in reduc the emiss level even below the requir impos by the author technolog develop of bleach process the forest industri in principl had two wai to choos in order to reduc the environment impact of the bleach process keep the chlorin ga bleach but render the organochlorin compound in the subsequ clean step harmless or develop other bleach and product process in order to elimin the residu lignin combin of these two principl have also occur the strategi ha primarili been to alter the process itself some exampl of thi is the introduct of oxygen bleach greater us of chlorin dioxid instead of chlorin ga extend delignif in the boil and the us of oxygen hydrogen peroxid in the alkali stage of the bleach all of these modif reduc chlorin ga consumpt and thu the amount as well as the composit of the emiss it is primarili the chlorin phenol compound with three or four chlorin atom which have disappear as well as dioxin technolog breakthrough have occur in sever field in gener the convers of the bleach techniqu ha had a major impact on the energi consumpt for produc bleach chemic oxygen for exampl requir less electr energi while chlorin dioxid requir consider more electr energi than chlorin ga most of the abov techniqu were in principl readi in the late 1980 s but full scale test had not been done the industri s joint environment research intensifi in the 1980 s thi work wa coordin and control by ssvl a great deal of research and develop work wa undertaken by equip supplier and chemic produc in connect with the industri from 1985 to 1990 the ssvl project environ 90 wa under wai all the environment program within the ssvl have sinc 1970 to a greater or lesser extent involv bleach emiss studi of bleach plant wast occupi a central role in environ 90 anoth not inconsider part is the accumul oper experi which ha enabl the process to improv further with respect to emiss level when the new technolog ha been consolid emiss ar like to be yet further reduc todai aox level below 1 5 kg per ton of pulp ar not consid relev from an environment aspect but must be regard as technolog paramet the remain chlorin compound contain few chlorin atom ar broken down rel rapidli and ar not regard as equal danger from an environment point of view other measur method must be develop in the 1990 s summar analysi strict measur for reduc emiss of organochlorin compound were start as earli as the 1970 s with the introduct of oxygen bleach on a larg scale the main reason for thi wa the environment requir by the author a major reduct in organochlorin compound came with the introduct of oxygen bleach a decreas of about 50 percent in comparison with convent chlorin bleach it is interest to note that out of sever differ possibl to reduc emiss the swedish industri itself chose oxygen bleach in the case of oxygen bleach it wa also possibl to refer to econom reason environment issu grew in import in the 1980 s the govern also establish strict environment goal and set up strict environment requir consequ the forest industri wa forc to introduc rel untest technolog on a larg scale the technic solut exist in principl in the 1980 s the forest industri expand and the mill have made new

radiat which ha no tast color or smell have becom clear consequ that manifest themselv to a consider extent not right awai and sometim onli after gener radiat ha plai a dirti joke on human which to thi dai ha not listen to the omin warn of specialist did human listen to the warn of vladimir ivanovich vernadskii that were made back in the 1920s or to the warn voic by curi sakharov and mani other of the most highli qualifi profession deal with radiat and what about the impenetr system of gener secreci that for decad surround former soviet and now russian nuclear radiat problem and still

opinion in circumvent of the ministri of environment protect and natur resourc or in ani event in direct contradict to exist legisl on access to environment inform manag to persuad the presidium of the suprem soviet to adopt a special decre block the declassif of it past department document can thi possibl enhanc our nation secur i am afraid that just the opposit is true it is fundament clear that radiat contamin in russia is the no 1 form of pollut chernobyl fallout cover thousand of squar kilomet of which mani have been taken out of econom us for a long time to come vast territori have been contamin or subject to contamin in the southern ural as a result of a number of radiat accid and the discharg of highli radioact effluent into the tobol basin radiat ha also scorch russian land adjoin the altai with the semipalatinsk prove ground the novaya zemlya prove ground is a major sourc of radioact contamin on a russian wide scale the result of the long past abov ground and atmospher test there will be felt for a long time still to come through the biolog accumul of radionuclid in the north s ecosystem and what about the contamin of the yenisei over a rang of hundr possibl thousand of kilomet as a result of the product of weapon grade plutonium at krasnoyarsk 26 or the contamin of the underground environ as a result of the pump of liquid radioact wast into it at krasnoyarsk 26 and tomsk 7 or the nearli 100 underground nuclear explos for peac purpos that have left radioact pockmark across practic the whole countri but all thi contamin mai seem a trifl in comparison to the daili alreadi familiar radiat danger that we face from the hundr of thousand of instrument contain radioact isotop and ar us with sometim crimin careless from the background radiat urban develop where the wall of mani build have been made like those in omsk out of radioact crush stone from radioact road the bed of which contain radioact crush stone and slag from unmark former

in the past decad more than 600 site of radioact contamin were found and elimin on the territori of moscow but that is not reassur sinc anoth 50 60 such place ar found here everi year and by no mean all of moscow s territori ha been adequ studi in thi respect moreov even in the largest citi the exist monitor of radioact contamin is incap of rapidli give us comprehens and object data numer problem of the countri s radioact contamin ar connect with radioact wast in the broad mean of the term and without teach the scientist who ar profession concern with the problem of radioact wast let me note for them and a broad circl of zelenyi mir reader from the viewpoint of an ecologist and a politician just a few aspect of the problem that ar as a rule consid either extrem rare or mere in pass and then onli by specialist first of all a word about the profession respons of scientist connect with the nuclear industri how could thei have develop for the economi technolog that did not wind up with figur speak the clean up of the work place elimin of the radioact contamin which thei knew inevit accompani the technolog thei develop when the activ construct of nuclear power plant began in our countri and abroad specialist essenti brush off the question of the problem of radioact wast don t prevent us from work for the good of civil the question of radioact wast will be solv in the next few year sever decad have pass and where is that fundament solut vitrifi radioact wast or harden them with bitumen or cement or pump them under the ground or discharg them into the world s ocean cannot be consid such a solut larger and larger territori ar have to be set asid for radiat graveyard it now appear that we intend to shift the solut of the problem of radioact wast onto the shoulder of futur gener why have specialist onli now start talk serious about plan to dismantl and take out of servic nuclear power plant that have outliv their normal lifetim can it be that 40 year ago develop did not know that the lifetim of power station wa limit thei knew but thei did not show the least concern for prepar plan for rehabilit the environ follow their oper the second aspect of the no 1 problem is close connect with the first and also rare discuss by specialist it is the problem of public trust our nuclear industri leader repeatedli talk about the absolut safeti of the rbmk uranium graphit channel type reactor and perhap onli academician a p aleksandrov ha publicli repent for what he did speak at a gener meet of the ussr academi of scienc and what about the rest of the gener and head design and other person who made the extrem danger decis that result in mani billion of dollar worth of loss and the ruin health of thousand of our fellow citizen i speak of the need to repent becaus onli that can result in the cleans after which trust can come there will be no trust without repent and the admiss of mistak incident the precis determin of the caus of the emerg of the problem of radioact wast which is close bound up with the admiss of past mistak in the nuclear and radiat technolog that were develop would also be of great help in choos cours of effect action todai without public trust the develop of the nuclear industri will be made more difficult or will be altogeth imposs no matter what decis the council of minster take at present the ministri of atom energi is give a lot of attent to restor public trust in the form of color booklet on nuclear power plant the establish of public relat unit and an activ campaign in the press but all that is not enough becaus the societi is not hear penit or repent or the open and honest analysi of mistak from them is it possibl that anyon serious think that the question of build interregion radiat graveyard on novaya zemlya or the kola peninsula or the question of build a storag facil for the plutonium from dismantl nuclear warhead can be solv at thi time in the quiet of moscow offic glasnost with regard to plan a respect and construct dialogu with citizen who think differ than the develop of nuclear technolog that is the onli wai to overcom the distrust of societi the third aspect of these reflect concern the legitimaci of action we dream of live in a rule of law state and ar try to build on as soon as possibl but in our practic activ we shamelessli ignor or violat the law the law ha determin whether thi is good or bad it ha determin that radioact materi mai not be ship in from abroad that radioact wast mai not be discharg into the sea and that radioact wast mai not be dispos of in space the first and second provis ar constantli violat and seriou discuss ar constantli be held about violat the third confer ar held and resolut ar adopt what ar for all intent and purpos crimin activ ar openli plan and carri out think about it you nuclear specialist so that later some of you will not end up in the defend s dock a law on the handl of radioact wast ha alreadi pass on first read in the suprem soviet it is distress to realiz that it is onli the first legisl act special regul radiat safeti our nuclear specialist who veri vigor emphas their complet observ of all the recommend of the iaea intern atom energi agenc have for some reason fail to follow a singl on of the iaea main recommend to ani state plan the us of nuclear energi befor build nuclear power plant and introduc nuclear technolog adopt nation legisl let s be candid unquestion the absenc of such legisl and adher onli to semisecret or complet secret department instruct go splendidli hand in hand with the aforement secreci which sometim even now assum paranoid form were advantag to mani peopl the fourth aspect of the problem which is also of great practic import is overcom the department syndrom which can be briefli formul as follow the interest of the depart come first it ha develop histor that the ministri of atom energi is a kind of state within a state a supermonopoli in mani sphere of the us of nuclear energi and accord to the classic law of state bureaucraci ani depart act first and foremost in it own interest but the interest of such an immens depart as the ministri of atom energi mai danger diverg from the interest of the state and societi for exampl there exist a new unusu method of harden liquid wast that is sever time as effect as and less costli than the exist method for vitrifi them or harden them with bitumen or cement it wa develop outsid the ministri of atom energi by a group of solar scientist and practition from berezniki the need to more rapidli and effici cleans the countri s territori of radioact wast would seem to be obviou given the coloss budget deficit as would the necess of promptli check out that propos and if it effect is confirm shift to that method but that is appar not the case for a year the inventor have been ask the ministri of atom energi to conduct an expert review of their studi and propos it will be difficult to overcom the ministri of atom energi s danger

ishikawa enerugi foramu with sadahiko washimi vp kansai electr power compani and atsuyuki suzuki professor faculti of engin univers of tokyo text most signific cours of nuclear fuel recycl ef let s begin with mr suzuki we sincer appreci your work on the nuclear fuel recycl expert subcommitte report issu on 10 juli 1991 sinc then the intern trend toward non prolifer ha becom more dynam with the problem over what to do with the plutonium from dismantl nuclear weapon in the former soviet union the transport of plutonium from franc to japan by the akatsuki maru and so forth what do you think suzuki two year have pass sinc we issu the nuclear fuel recycl report and dure that time mani factor for chang have arisen on kei point in that report is the fact that it show in number the cost of plutonium suppli and demand over the next 20 year or so anoth point is that the report emphas we should reveal beforehand both at home and abroad japan s plan for plutonium util and in the spirit of open proce with those plan these two issu will be import from now on as well i think we should carefulli reconsid the quantit balanc of suppli and demand in the hear to revis the nuclear energi long term plan moreov as far as open is concern i think it will be increasingli import for japan to be as up front as possibl about her plan for peac util of nuclear energi when we consid the rapid shift toward nuclear disarma accompani the fall of the soviet union the problem with north korea and so forth i sincer hope the long term plan subcommitte will consid thi carefulli and if thei do then the kei issu will be what will happen to japan s fbr commerci plan ef it appear that the plan for fbr commerci is attach by it umbil cord to the hear on the long term plan that mean that fbr commerci and plutonium util ar realli two side of the same coin thi relationship becam crystal clear when the continu sinter furnac that make fuel pellet for the prototyp reactor monju broke down and delai critic for the third time some peopl on the basic subpanel which ha the job of overse the expert subcommitte work on the long term plan have said that we must decid whether to give prioriti to the balanc of plutonium suppli and demand or to cost effect suzuki both cost effect and balanc plutonium suppli and demand ar import but in discuss up till now consist in govern polici ha been consid more import than cost effect becaus of the posit of the atom energi commiss of japan so it seem to me that the discuss over plutonium suppli and demand ha receiv more attent from an intern standpoint howev if we try to go ahead with a specif plan in the futur then it is import to consid how much it will cost in that sens mani peopl ar now discuss how we should handl the issu of cost effect at least that is my understand everyon associ with nuclear power in japan believ that plutonium will sure becom an import sourc of energi in the long run but if we accept the premis that plutonium is absolut necessari then we also have to sai that it doe not matter how much it will cost howev in order to master the us of plutonium for the futur we must make the oper both streamlin and cost effect and an extrem import point will be how much we can increas thi cost effect streamlin from now on mox process will cost more than uranium process but if we sai it is better just becaus it cost more that is not the true reason actual there ar two advantag we can cut down on uranium usag if we recycl plutonium in lwr and uranium enrich will no longer be necessari furthermor if we make plutonium mix fuel of cours we have to pai the process cost but in ani event we should be abl to find a happi medium i think we should make thi a goal for technolog develop in other word i think it is veri import that we should attach great import to the govern s approach that we not possess excess plutonium and at the same time we should also pursu cost effect streamlin of the oper ef mr washimi what is the posit of those in the electr power industri washimi from a secur standpoint i think we should clearli adopt the concept of plutonium balanc as nation polici and move in the direct of not possess excess plutonium i think the basic path to achiev thi is to adopt mox fuel and us plutonium in fbr my reason is that we cannot acquir energi for the 21st centuri if we do not util plutonium but when we consid cost effect as well we cannot simpli sai that pursu a balanc in suppli and demand should be our polici no matter how much it cost the electr power industri collect a fee from everyon who us electr and on basi for make decis is how much of that fee can be appli to the cost of prepar futur energi suppli on the other hand technolog develop take a veri long time to bear fruit when we look at the histori of lwr develop it ha taken about 30 year we have been told that even if we begin develop for fbr commerci todai it will be 2030 befor the ag of the fbr truli arriv all the peopl who ar aliv until that time will be custom of the electr power industri and it is up to us to find out how much of their electr bill thei will allow us to us to pai for technolog develop from that standpoint the electr power industri cannot boldli promot fbr commerci without the consent of the populac therefor i believ the electr power industri should not act on it own but should discuss the matter with scholar and the govern then in some form or other we should draw a line to indic how much capit we think we ought to invest in the futur and strive to work within that rang ef mr suzuki the idea that plutonium util and fbr will be expens that ha been embrac by democrat parti non prolifer hardlin in the us congress and mr leventh the anti plutonium activist ha attain wide accept most american nuclear weapon have plutonium warhead and american belief ar strongli root in a societi where peac and militari us of nuclear energi have been mix togeth suzuki when plutonium is not recycl it is commonli call on through in the case of on through we cannot determin the final stop point in other word can we or should we get rid of all our spent fuel no countri ha tri thi yet even in discuss in the us comparison ar made without clarifi thi issu and so in the true sens of the word comparison of cost effect ar not possibl what is import in explan why recycl is reason is whether spent fuel is consid a us resourc or not i believ it is a us resourc so for me the problem is when and how much of it will be recycl as a resourc rather than simpli a problem of cost effect i think thi is a nearli insolv problem if we do not consid how we will obtain a stabl long term suppli of the resourc in the past the rule ha been that spent fuel will be recycl as a resourc as soon as possibl but there is realli no need to hurri i think it is import to us the right amount of spent fuel at the right time as a resourc and definit not dispos of it as wast ef but japan doe not have a lot of land washimi japan is a small countri but nuclear fuel itself is veri compact and we ar still debat whether we should dispos of spent fuel entir or keep it for process either wai if we can obtain the consensu of the major of the populac it will not take up a lot of space on the other hand by the second half of the 21st centuri we will begin to reach the end of our buri reserv of oil and natur ga and their price will gradual rise even if the fbr were develop right awai although it would be more expens than gener electr from oil burn plant right now as power produc we must give the highest prioriti to the issu of which path will place the smallest burden on our custom in the futur when price of lng and oil have gone up i believ that we can acquir adequ cost effect at that time by improv and develop our present fbr technolog weather the mass media storm ef as a former newspap report i wa disappoint in the report of the transport of plutonium by the akatsuki maru it took more than six year to complet the u s japan atom energi agreement that place the two countri on an equal foot at that time near the end of the negoti the us wa insist on transport by air but japan resist howev the state of alaska and other protest becaus anchorag airport would lie along the cours so the murkowski amend wa pass by congress to revers the us posit if the newspap report had bother to learn the histori behind plutonium transport thei would not have report the event in that wai washimi it is necessari to util plutonium in order to guarante a futur sourc of nuclear fuel for power gener in accord with thi basic plan we had the reprocess done oversea recov the plutonium and brought it back on the akatsuki maru i consid thi on step we have taken toward the futur at that time we were oppos by greenpeac but i think that perhap we did not strive hard enough to seek their understand about plutonium in addit we could not reveal absolut everi bit of inform to the public becaus of the need to protect nuclear materi it is human natur that the more thing we keep hidden the more peopl want to know about them my understand is that the govern is review issu such as how to form mutual agreement and how much inform can be releas to the public these ar certainli issu that must be consid therefor we must hold firm to our basic plan for convert unburn uranium 238 which account for 99 3 percent of all the uranium into plutonium 239 and us it suzuki what mr washimi said just now illustr a good lesson from the standpoint of protect nuclear materi in other word from the standpoint of secur it is onli natur that some inform is difficult to disclos to the public the govern ha follow the approach that it ha respons to the us and to europ so inform disclos to the public should be kept to an absolut minimum howev mani ordinari citizen doubt whether that is the real issu or not inform concern safeti is not for secur but for safeti and thei think that as much inform as possibl concern safeti should be avail to the public on the other hand inform that is absolut necessari for secur cannot be disclos to the public in realiti it is difficult to know where to draw the line through what we have just experienc we have learn that mani peopl in japan think non disclosur should be kept to a bare minimum and mani peopl in place like franc seem to feel the same wai we have learn anoth import lesson as well we japanes tend to take for grant that becaus we ar clearli limit the us of plutonium to peac purpos and ar not even consid militari us peopl in other countri will natur go along with our plan our experi ha made us realiz onc more that that is not the case on more point is that becaus we japanes tend to think about plutonium and atom energi pure in term of peac util we have becom somewhat insensit to the us of atom energi in other countri japanes newspap and other media have paid littl attent to the north korean problem the foreign ministri ha had sever contact through formal diplomat channel and that is what we expect but newspap and public opinion poll show almost no interest i am sure that american find thi hard to believ thei cannot understand how the japanes can be so nonchal about a neighbor countri want to go nuclear i am hope that thi flap about the akatsuki maru will be an opportun for japanes peopl to gain some understand of the work of intern peac ef i watch a special program broadcast on nhk on 23 mai entitl japan the plutonium superpow ii the dream and realiti of nuclear fuel recycl i felt it wa so bias that i sent a letter with sever question to their offic of inquiri thei pass my letter on to the head of the report divis but the respons i got back did not answer my question suzuki report talk to me too but it appear that the report had just come to me for inform and i did not appear on the program at all when the report talk to me thei made it clear what the program intend to sai so i wa not too surpris but when a report organ tackl the plutonium problem i guess we can expect them to be rather critic in mani instanc thei did not acknowledg the fact and i wish thei were a littl more enlighten regardless of their approach howev i am happi that thei spent two even of prime time to look at plutonium it mai not have been directli effect in open peopl s ey but a report from an unrel magazin publish visit me after watch the program and ask me if what he saw on the program wa true after i explain thing to him he wrote an articl expound the true fact of the situat so there ha been that kind of secondari effect i like to look at it in a posit light ef i watch it togeth with my wife and after it wa over my wife said to me why don t you stop work your finger to the bone the futur is so bleak and develop the fbr will be a total wast washimi i agre with mr suzuki that it wa good for them to report on the plutonium issu at least after the first part of the nhk special that is how we felt but the second part wa just too on side for exampl the program state that there ar 5 million ton of uranium resourc so the fbr is total unnecessari right now the amount of offici confirm unmin uranium is 2 1 million ton and even if we includ all the most probabl addit estim resourc it onli come to 3 4 million ton the onli wai to get 5 million ton is to add in everi specul about uranium deposit that have not been confirm and mai or mai not exist we still do not know whether thei ar there or not not onli that the figur thei us togeth with the 5 million ton ar base on the premis that the price of uranium will go up to 100 lb right now it is onli 10 lb so i do not think their calcul ar realist thei should show more clearli how thei arriv at those number look at anoth exampl the program report that reprocess will produc a sixfold increas in nuclear wast actual that is true right now but we have reduc the amount of high level wast with vitrif and almost all the wast is low level wast i wish thei would have dug a littl deeper and explain there is a good chanc that reprocess will gener much less wast than direct dispos in the futur thank to a reduct in the amount of fuel we will us final i wish thei had taken a long term view and address the basic issu that we were discuss earlier that plutonium is an import energi resourc for the futur and look at our present situat in move toward it applic ef what about my wife s statement that develop the fbr will be a total wast washimi a veri long time is need for technolog develop just look at airplan 30 or 40 year pass between the wright brother and jet aircraft even when we begin full fledg commerci of the fbr and work veri hard at it the develop will take 30 to 40 year current we ar work veri hard on research and develop but we should look beyond that and make decis base on the fbr us as a sourc of energi fbr commerci and domest mox product far awai ef the power industri is lean toward domest product of mox fuel and i believ that prepar for domest mox product ar on of the issu in the upcom long term plan review suzuki construct ha begun on the reprocess plant at rokkasho villag under the premis that it is for the util of recov plutonium and uranium the most effect wai for util it is in the form of mox natur we must think about the structur of a domest mox fuel busi the electr power compani ar encourag by thi move up till now pnc ha conduct technolog develop mainli in the three field of uranium enrich reprocess and mox fuel as thei relat to the fuel cycl the mainstream of uranium enrich and reprocess ha alreadi move to the privat sector so that leav us with mox fuel when we look at the path of uranium enrich and reprocess in their transit from technolog develop to privat sector commerci it appear there ar wai to make better us of the fruit of technolog develop the biggest problem is personnel i believ it is veri import how we util the peopl who dealt with develop of mox fuel process technolog at pnc and who current possess vital know how when we make the transit to commerci i hope that thi time when we decid the direct of the busi structur we consid thi issu much more carefulli than we did in the past ef i have seen the plutonium fuel no 3 develop lab at pnc tokai work as you look at it from the front there is an fbr line on the left and an atr line on the right four year have pass sinc the build for the atr line wa complet but it is still stand empti on reason is the delai at the oma site for the atr demonstr reactor of cours i think pnc should bring in peopl from fuel manufactur and togeth make mox fuel both for the oma reactor and for the plutonium thermal reactor for power compani us suzuki just as you sai the kei point will be how well we make us of thi opportun and tie in the pnc expert in thi field to commerci the atr line is veri import and it must proce on schedul from now on i have a feel that the peopl involv with mox fuel ar take a rather narrow approach mox fuel allow rather flexibl design to be made and if we would do so i think cost effect streamlin with mox fuel will make a big jump forward i hope thi view will be includ when decis ar made the heater on the sinter furnac for make fuel for monju broke down recent delai critic the caus ar rather complex but fuel for the monju ha a plutonium content of more than 20 percent with a maximum enrich of about 25 percent pnc ha been make fuel for fugen for a long time but that fuel ha a plutonium content of 1 2 percent about 3 percent maximum go from that level to number in the 20 percent rang mean a plutonium content 10 time higher becaus it is difficult to guarante the same kind of yield for a fuel with 10 time more plutonium i expect thi will becom an issu from now on we can us a special campaign to make fuel for the fbr but in the futur we must make it on a product line that flow continu in the same wai we make fuel for the lwr todai a veri import issu will be how we achiev that level and in that sens i would like to see the no 3 develop lab be activ util ef when a convers wa held thi spring among some of the most promin leader in thi field it wa leak that on issu for studi in the long term plan hear will be consid the present trend whether the electr power industri can actual build a second or third demonstr reactor even though the present long term plan state that two or three will be built judg from the present trend when we look at the most recent hear in the fbr develop project expert subcommitte some peopl mai propos an intern project for build the second and third demonstr reactor like iter in which japan the us ec and russia have begun engin design for an experiment fusion reactor washimi right now there is a hot debat go on about when the first demonstr reactor will be built the present long term plan call for construct on the first demonstr reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990s but it must be suffici base on our experi with monju and we must still get some kind of yardstick on cost effect furthermor there ar some technic problem that ar still at the r d stage howev the attitud of the electr power industri is that we should forg steadili ahead with the develop of the first demonstr reactor as far as the second and third demonstr reactor ar concern we should make our decis with the belief that thi technolog will make steadi progress we ar try veri hard to make our first demonstr reactor a larg reactor like the super phenix in franc but it mai not turn out that wai thi is my person opinion but the larger the reactor the more time it take to deal with ani kind of troubl so i have a feel that we mai eventu have a small reactor i believ that in addit to our experi with the first demonstr reactor our concept for the second demonstr reactor will be base on research on the variou possibl for build it in the futur the third reactor li even farther down the road and although i am not complet sure i expect that on import standard for make the decis will be how much it will cost i believ it is import to reach a consensu on how much of the current fee for electr should be us to pai for the cost of futur energi ef mr suzuki you made an excel comment at the last meet of the expert subcommitte you said that if we proce by focus on the reactor the burden will be pass on to the fuel cycl and we will be forc to think about reactor in term of the fuel cycl suzuki i made that statement right after we got the new that pnc continu sinter furnac that wa make fuel for monju had broken down and that monju critic would suffer a long delai as we seek higher and higher level of perform in reactor specif the burden fall on the fuel and thing get veri difficult from the standpoint of acquir fuel monju fuel ha low densiti and the rod ar short and thin when ask pnc could not sai it wa unabl to make that kind of fuel actual make the fuel a littl thicker and much denser would have been a lot easier lwr fuel can be made that wai pnc ha to make fuel that is harder to make than lwr fuel i think it will be import in the futur to adopt design in which the reactor and the cycl ar technolog in balanc now we ar concern with the process of make the transit to commerci so a veri import issu will be how much we can improv our technolog in that sens short term cost effect and so forth ar irrelev it is import that we think of thi as technolog link to the futur and in that sens i want to see plan for demonstr reactor that take the fuel cycl into account expect for new long term plan ef in close do you have ani request for the long term plan expert subcommitte washimi as a basic line of reason i hope that the long term plan will not place too much emphasi on immedi result energi technolog take a veri long time to develop so it is not wise to make decis base onli on the present it is import to take a long rang view i also hope the committe look at thing from the standpoint of the gener populac i am sure that the basic framework of the long term plan will be clearli written down but i am wonder whether it could be put in the form of a stori that averag citizen can understand peopl concern with atom energi can understand if you sai in the year two thousand and someth or other we will do thi but i do not think the averag citizen understand why i think we need to publish a kind of cliff s note to the long term plan suzuki i work at a univers and deal with young student i want to think that in the futur thei will be activ in the field of atom energi in that sens the long term plan is veri import and i think most peopl ar particularli interest in what will happen to the fbr project in the nuclear fuel recycl expert subcommitte report we issu two year ago we said that we would need roughli 10 20 ton of plutonium for the fbr i think thi time we should express quantiti more precis if we do so i think that peopl involv in reprocess will be encourag and the target for mox manufactur will also becom clear of cours cost effect is veri import and power compani reflect thi in electr rate power compani cannot proce on their own if the cost is too high therefor the most import problem for the upcom long term plan session will be express the fbr project in a wai that most peopl can go along with not onli in the field of atom energi but in other field as well japan is show her econom and technolog strength to the rest of the world we must ask whether japan alon should bear the risk of technolog develop that will benefit the whole world as econom burden continu to increas intern cooper often mean mere provid fund atom energi is differ becaus by pour both econom and technic strength into technolog develop of the fbr we will benefit other nation as well in the futur i believ we have arriv at an ag in which that will be our goal if that is the case there is a possibl the fbr project mai be consid quit ration even if the financi cost is consider washimi i agre complet we must approach thi from the standpoint that the plutonium recycl fbr is not onli energi for japan but energi for the whole world we must also look at it as someth for futur gener as well as for those aliv todai therefor cost effect come into plai becaus the monei will come from fee paid by todai s user of electr in japan basic we must consid the futur of the world s energi and ask ourselv how much of the burden our gener should bear

wing floor space about 1500 m sup 2 and a four stori research wing floor space about 4500 m sup 2 i will briefli discuss the result of sever year of r d the high level liquid wast produc when recycl spent fuel will be surround by three layer artifici barrier and buri deep underground first the hot soup that contain intens radioact is melt togeth with borosil glass which can withstand high heat and solidifi in a stainless steel cylind canist thi is call vitrif and it form the first barrier next becaus thi vitrifi bodi will gener heat due to radioact decai it will be store and cool down in an abov ground facil for 30 50 year after that the wast will actual be buri deep underground and at that time it will be enclos in a metal protect contain overpack which form the second barrier final it will be pack in a shock absorb materi bentonit a type of clai is a good candid that will lie between the contain and the bedrock and form the third barrier underground water will not easili permeat the bentonit and it will act as a protect mattress against geolog pressur from the bedrock and earthquak research ha reveal the follow inform first barrier vitrif act to prevent radioact from leach out into underground water the scientif approach that support thi make us of research on similar natur phenomena natur analog the basalt glass that came to the surfac dure ancient erupt on the izu peninsula and mt fuji is physic and chemic similar to the borosil glass us in vitrif the rate of decomposit of thi volcan glass due to exposur to underground water over the past 2800 year or so is onli a few micron per 1000 year and when we look at it surfac magnifi more than 20 000 time with a scan electron microscop we see onli a veri thin void layer where the atom have escap the decomposit rate of borosil glass ha been observ to be about 10 time as fast at thi rate we can make a simpl calcul that radioact mai first escap from a vitrifi bodi between 100 000 to 1 000 000 year in the futur an interest result wa obtain in thi natur analog research quit recent by analyz basalt glass collect from a layer of mudston at kamogawa citi chiba prefectur thi band lai at the bottom of the sea in prehistor time but over time it wa lift up and becam dry land thi basalt glass that wa collect came from a volcan erupt sever million year ago and perhap becaus it wa enclos in mud for such a long long time it surfac show almost no decomposit void when examin by sem second barrier for the overpack the primari candid is a contain made of carbon steel studi of worst case estim show a corros progress of about 3 cm per 1000 year the protect overpack wall is 30 cm thick and it act to resist geolog pressur so there is suffici leewai in term of corros recent the amount of water leak from pipe in downtown tokyo due to corros ha reach a level where it can no longer be ignor but thi leakag is due to crack gener by oxid from oxygen in the soil on the other hand the environ deep underground is almost oxygen free and corros will not progress as it doe on the earth s surfac in the futur research will verifi whether the hydrogen ga gener in the corros reaction will form a protect layer on the surfac of the overpack and serv as a reinforc to keep underground water from penetr or whether it will dispers into the earth s crust thi is on question the test wing of the new facil will attempt to answer third barrier it ha been confirm that at temperatur of 100 c or less bentonit show almost no decomposit and will serv to inhibit the movement of radioact dure deep underground burial thi clai will be pack between the underground rock and the overpack at thick rang from sever centimet to on meter becaus the total weight of a canist and overpack is almost 12 ton is there a chanc it might sink analysi ha alreadi shown that it will sink about 1mm but thi still need to be confirm on the other hand becaus bentonit is clai will it turn to mud when it come in contact with underground water and be strip awai there is some data that show it will not strip awai unless the underground water is flow fast at a larg volum answer these question will be anoth issu address by the test wing of the new facil make a model with data from repetit test asid from these futur issu if we look at pnc achiev over mani year of test and experi we reach the conclus that the lifetim of the three barrier layer artifici barrier will surpass the 1000 year or so need to reduc the level of radioact in high level wast the radioact wast polici expert subcommitte of the atom energi commiss check thi out and on 21 juli thi year pronounc the result gener valid the subcommitte point out that expans and consolid of data and improv of artifici barrier reliabl should form the main thrust of futur research in

on nuclear submarin of the pacif ocean fleet up until now as we know had onli on solut in our countri the wast water were simpli pour into the sea the countri had no develop technolog for purifi these wast water last fall when thei were last pour into the sea of japan it evok an extrem neg reaction from the opposit shore the japanes ar also veri uneasi about the two tanker fill to the brim with liquid radioact wast in the form of radioact ic which ar moor at the dock of the zvezda plant therefor it is no accid that the japanes have express their readi to render assist in solv thi problem which of cours is pure our own and not onli to provid us with tanker which we ar refus but also to allot financi fund for the construct in the krai of a plant for dispos of liquid radioact wast under the condit that some of these fund will be transfer to japanes firm so thei can place order there it would seem that thi option would be complet accept to us but event relat to thi project which would seem to be free of charg for russia show that thi is not so repres of two japanes firm were in vladivostok on a prospect mission in decemb for their govern s monei thei want to do a great favor for these unreason russian who do not know what to do with their radioact wast in the krai administr there wa a confer to which for some reason nobodi thought of invit scientist from the far eastern branch of the russian academi of scienc nonetheless thei were subsequ abl to look over the japanes plan and make judgment about it which briefli consist in the follow in the first place the technolog propos by the foreign firm would requir extrem larg expenditur of electr energi when compar to the output from a thermal electr power plant with averag capac and thi when the region is in a deep energi crisi to begin with if we keep in mind the mani billion spent to pai for electr energi for thi reason alon combin the japanes project with our harsh condit look problemat to sai the least second after the plant is built it subsequ oper will cost the region 300 000 450 000 annual purchas consum materi spare part conduct repair work etc final in the third place the japanes specialist as it turn out ar suggest purifi the radioact wast with the format of other wast highli activ salt solut and solid radioact wast and subsequ dispos of these is not envis by the japanes technolog in gener our scientist came to the conclus substanti in all respect that the japanes version for dispos of liquid radioact wast in the maritim region is unaccept mainli becaus of it obsolesc and it extrem high cost as a counterpropos the scientist and specialist of the far eastern branch of the russian academi of scienc put forth their own altern plan it consist in us sorption technolog take advantag of mani year of work and the latest achiev in thi area which happen to be from far eastern scientist it advantag over the japanes version consist in it consider lower 1 000 fold proport expenditur of electr energi the util of uniqu and inexpens materi multi composit sorbent produc from local raw materi chuguyevskii zeolit the significantli lesser capit intens of product and the independ of it oper from deliveri of import spare part and batch item the deputi chairman of the far eastern branch of the russian academi of scienc doctor of chemic scienc v sergiyenko present these conclus in a report sent on 16 decemb of last year to the governor of the krai ye nazdrantenko he also point out in it that the far eastern branch of the russian academi of scienc wa prepar to take the initi for creat an interdepartment creativ collect which could in a short period of time liter within a month or two present a detail plan for dispos of low level liquid radioact wast in the maritim region for technic econom and ecolog expert evalu at the same time he emphas the insist need to conduct such an expert evalu befor make a decis or sign ani document with japanes firm the krai administr wa ask to allot 5 million rubl r for conduct the expert apprais thi report wa follow by a note of clarif sent to the same address it discuss the real possibl within three or four month under the condit that proper financ is avail of creat a domest experiment industri instal base on sorption technolog with a capac for process 10 15 tonn of liquid radioact wast a dai directli at the enterpris where the radioact wast is accumul what wa the result from these report on 6 januari the committe on the util of natur of the krai administr held a confer devot to thi question at which emphasi wa onc again place on the need to conduct a comprehens expert apprais of all version of dispos of liquid radioact wast and the develop of an altern russian plan in respons to the on propos by the japanes but that is all monei for conduct thi expert apprais not to mention fund for creat an experiment industri instal about r2 million rubl wa not provid on the ground that the problem of dispos of liquid radioact wast in the maritim region wa not a krai problem but a feder on and so the financ should come from the correspond budget still our scientist consid the fact that thei live not in moscow but in the maritim region and in order to reinforc their conclus with concret result at the end of februari thei conduct a seri of laboratori experi on sorption technolog for purifi real radioact wast from the zvezda plant their result turn out to be more than promis after purifi liquid radioact wast in sorption column the content of artifici radionuclid wa significantli lower than the natur radioact background and 10 1 000 time less than the norm for maximum permiss concentr that is after purif thi water could be pour directli overboard without ani ill effect is thi not an indic of how well our technolog can compet with ani foreign on and ar our scientist ask too much by insist on a competit of plan so that the russian japanes american and ani other instal will be place side by side and then the result will be compar thi is what is done throughout the entir world when put variou plan up for bid when peopl inde want to end up select the most advanc technolog which is the most econom effect in all respect but as it turn out thi approach doe not fit in with our realiti what kind of competit of plan or bid can there be when for three month the krai bureaucrat will not even allow the vladivostok scientist the creator of the most advanc technolog for dispos of liquid radioact wast in russia and probabl in the world as well a competit would show that in on the discuss of the problem yet as we learn not so long ago in the presenc of the governor but in the absenc of the scientist and specialist from the far eastern branch of the russian academi of scienc in the krai administr there wa a confer as a result of which it seem to have been decid to give prefer to the technolog for dispos of liquid radioact wast propos by the japanes corpor marubeni correspond member of the russian academi of scienc viktor glushchenko wa extrem candid and it seem justifi harsh in hi evalu of thi situat to me and my colleagu who ar specialist in thi area thi whole episod seem simpli shame he said why is the fate of a plan place in the hand of krai bureaucrat so that later thei can again on invit from the marubeni firm travel as expert as some have alreadi done to japan and bring back present from there probabl for a job well done appar the same aspir motiv the pro japanes lobbi in moscow where thei have alreadi creat a concern which from all appear can more effici divid up the 100 million allot by the govern of japan for nuclear disarma in russia and the problem of dispos of radioact wast which is relat to thi for the monei of cours we thank you but who said that thi had to be invest onli in foreign firm when we have much better domest scientif develop and technolog that ar essenti alreadi prepar but which requir a littl monei to bring them to complet after all we ar not a lower volta as publish and we ourselv ar ultim in a posit to solv our own problem i tell you as a scientist v glushchenko said in conclus that if our multi composit sorbent ar not need and thei ar the basi of the technolog we propos for dispos of liquid radioact wast i will make everi effort to make sure that all our know how in thi area is patent abroad appar nobodi in russia need our develop i do not think that viktor yuryevich will do exactli that after all he is a russian man and a resid of the maritim region but a fact is still a fact dozen if not hundr of develop mani of which ar up to the world level by far eastern scientist remain unus and financ for current research is practic frozen and put domest sorption technolog to work for dispos of liquid radioact wast could be a first step in the develop in the maritim region of a whole number of scienc intens product for produc industri and medic sorbent that ar in extrem short suppli in the world and for which our scientist ar convinc there ar no analogu yet by invest a minimum todai when the order for manufactur equip can be place with our defens enterpris which ar now stand idl in the near futur it would be possibl to obtain a maximum and in foreign currenc these ar the kind of selfish goal pursu by our scientist in their desir to clear the krai of radioact and ani other kind of pollut without the particip of the japanes uncl who is certainli not selfless and who would seem to want to build for us a plant for dispos of liquid radioact wast free of charg us obsolet technolog and then for a long time receiv dividend in the form of incom from oper in a word our convers in their fashion befor go abroad to sign the contract with marubeni i will not mention other it would be a good idea for our bureaucrat to think about thi and perhap learn from their neighbor how to look after nation interest

incident about nuclear wast recent the green have tri to prevent their import into russia from finland why should our countri becom the world s nuclear garbag heap mikhaylov thi is all idl talk russia is allegedli put a time bomb under itself the soviet union ha construct sever nuclear electr power station abroad and the wast at these station can be store for no more than five year under the term of treati with bulgaria finland hungari and the czech republ russia as the ussr legal heir is continu to import it and process it at enterpris of the ministri of atom energi khokhlov where exactli mikhaylov where the fuel wa produc near krasnoyarsk tomsk and chelyabinsk after special process the nuclear electr power station wast is enclos in glass and store in concret bunker that is absolut safe for peopl and the environ khokhlov a sudden earthquak mikhaylov we do not expect earthquak in the place where nuclear electr power station wast is store for the next millenium in 1 000 year time is some cataclysm were to occur the process nuclear fuel will no longer present a danger new method ar now be develop for destroi nuclear wast it burn in special devic and it us in fast neutron reactor khokhlov but can you explain why then finland is reluct to buri the wast from it lovisa nuclear electr power station somewher in the tundra and is export them to us mikhaylov it doe not have the condit and technolog for process we do and it is econom advantag for russia to accept wast thei pai for it thei pai veri well a fight is now under wai on the nuclear wast market between the unit state franc and britain russia is also take part it mean big monei which we invest in inter alia the improv of the safeti of russian nuclear electr power station incident the finn ar alreadi consid whether to pai us monei or to keep their wast in their own countri khokhlov doe russia bear respons for the safeti of nuclear electr power station in ci and baltic state mikhaylov no sinc the collaps of the ussr these have been domest problem for sovereign state politician treat thi veri zealous but we russian nuclear scientist ar open to cooper with everyon armenia ha decid to resum the oper of it nuclear electr power station we ar help khokhlov on more problem connect with the collaps of the ussr an underground nuclear charg readi for explos remain in kazakhstan what will happen to it mikhaylov we ar prepar to dismantl the drive mechan zabivochnoy ustroystvo and we shall either remov the nuclear devic or destroi it on the spot it is small in term of yield less than on kilotonn it is not a militari charg but a simul anticip a question about the ecolog i shall sai there will be no problem khokhlov on the other hand it seem mani problem ar aris in connect with the rais of the sunken nuclear power submarin komsomolet mikhaylov the din rais over thi submarin in my opinion is in direct proport to the sum which certain group of peopl could obtain for carri out the rais oper there is a veri great deal of specul surround the komsomolet and it nuclear stuf rais a ship from such a depth and under such extrem condit is imposs i said so back in 1992 especi as there is no need there is no leakag of plutonium all the test show that we should leav the komsomolet on the sea bed the ship will disappear into the silt and natur itself will do a better job than peopl of neutral the nuclear weapon in it khokhlov how mani peopl ar now emploi in the russian nuclear weapon complex mikhaylov over 100 000 these peopl ar on of russia s chief resourc unfortun thei ar now have quit a difficult time live and work the total market into which thei have tri to push the nuclear sector the shortag of fund and our utterli primit convers have markedli reduc the return from both scienc and industri the sector s steadi develop can be achiev onli with state econom regul ye we can produc the world s best saucepan which will be competit on market from africa to america but do we realli need to enter the new centuri with saucepan in the veri near futur onli those countri in which high technolog ar develop will be abl to live properli i want russia to be on of them khokhlov in june the russian defens industri intend to go on strike will the nuclear scientist support them mikhaylov we ar forbidden by law to go on strike khokhlov what is the averag wage in the sector now mikhaylov in the industri specialist receiv an averag of r230 000 at a nuclear electr power station thei get r420 000 our scientist ar poorer the averag salari is r150 000 it is true that we have been abl to increas wage at the arzama 16 and chelyabinsk 70 feder nuclear center to r250 000 in 1993 some 6 8 percent of what were not the worst specialist left the ministri of atom energi for commerci structur a piti but it is surpris that given the miserli salari and the paltri grant from the state budget for the develop of scienc and industri given the fact that fix capit is more than 50 percent worn out the ministri of atom energi is work with an except return on mani salient we ar still ahead of the whole planet research and appli work is under wai in the field of nuclear physic high energi and superconduct physic thermonuclear fusion and electron onli patriot can work in these condit if the sector is allow to surviv now it will be of enorm benefit to russia khokhlov viktor nikitovich no on ha yet deni the famou formula if you want peac prepar for war our first atom bomb wa creat by kurchatov our first hydrogen bomb by sakharov and third gener weapon ar our babi is the appear of a new type of weapon in the veri near futur possibl mikhaylov i think so if mankind is unabl to renounc militari atom energi complet then such a weapon could appear by the year 2000 khokhlov how will it differ from exist model mikhaylov the nuclear warhead now avail ar usual call highli effect the new fourth gener will be guid weapon napravlennogo deystviya khokhlov can you predict who the inventor of thi weapon will be russian or us scientist mikhaylov it is hard to sai breakthrough in scienc depend littl on the econom or polit situat in a countri and our scientist brain work no wors than those

distributor in the puls column of the separ the dissolv in liquid form water phase come into contact with 30 percent tbp n dodecan organ phase tbp tributyl phosphat is an extract and n dodecan is a diluent uranium and plutonium have a high affin with tbp and ar extract into the organ phase but low affin fission product remain in the water phase and becom high level wast hlw next the organ phase enter the puls column of the distributor where a reduc is suppli here plutonium react with the reduc and transform into an oxid number that ha low affin with tbp it therefor cannot remain in the organ phase and switch to the water phase uranium doe not react with the reduc and remain in the organ phase in thi manner uranium and plutonium ar separ when uranium which is in the organ phase come into contact with dilut nitric acid in a stripper mixer settler an extract balanc reaction shift it to the water phase side and it is strip into the water phase the uranium and plutonium solut come from the distributor and enter separ refin the accompani trace of impur ar similarli remov by the extract strip oper befor extract plutonium and uranium ar adjust to state that ar more easili extract into tbp plutonium mainli by oxid reaction and uranium by rais the concentr of nitric acid refin is done twice but is shown onli onc in the figur to illustr the process simpli emerg from the refin the

glass melt furnac along with raw materi for glass thi mixtur is heat to high temperatur dissolv and turn into an oxid which then is assimil into molten glass the molten glass is pour into a stainless steel contain to cool and solidifi the contain cover is weld on make thi an even more stabl extrem safe solid wast materi iii safeti featur the reprocess plant is a nuclear chemic plant that separ and refin the element not nuclid in uranium plutonium and fission product by convent chemic oper becaus larg volum of unseal radioact materi ar handl complet safeti must be design in so that there is no effect on the environ dure normal as well as abnorm oper in addit to critic safeti design uniqu to nuclear facil fire and explos prevent design uniqu to chemic plant ar also import becaus organ solvent ar us there is risk that fire or explos could impair the abil to contain radioact substanc there ar safeti featur in reprocess plant that along with safeti design help to ensur a high degre of safeti we will explain these featur as follow becaus understand them is import to understand the safeti of the reprocess plant 1 sinc reprocess is carri out on spent fuel that ha cool for more than four year after extract from power reactor nuclid with short half live will have decai thu radioact rare gase and iodin which easili leak out into the environ will have decai and disappear for the most part at the same time intension energi decai heat that might break down contain barrier will have lessen 2 although radioact substanc in an unseal state ar dispers to multipl equip for handl the volum of the substanc that ar extract or ar subject to other physic or chemic reaction is rel small becaus the capac of column and tank have been design appropri also the danger of an abnorm situat escal rapidli and on a broad scale is basic slight becaus these equip ar oper at below normal pressur and in most case at mild temperatur below 100 c oper involv harsher chemic reaction ar not carri out either 3 in an accid on thing that might affect the environ is releas of radioact aerosol liquid or solid radioact particl suspend in air into the atmospher if radioact solut or fine particl were transfer into the ventil system in aerosol form as a result of explos or boil the amount would be slight onli 10 sup 3 10 sup 4 or so sup h when the system is properli design even in an organ solvent fire if radioact substanc in the form of aerosol carri by smoke were to get into the ventil system it would be around 10 sup 3 of combust volum sup i toler is design into the high effici particul filter instal in the ventil system so that thei will continu function even under condit brought about by an accid but even without reli on these filter the potenti scale of the accid will be self limit becaus the transfer of radioact substanc into the ventil system is small and becaus thei will be remov by adhes in the pipe duct these safeti featur combin with the safeti design describ in the section below ensur a veri high degre of safeti in the rokkasho reprocess plant iv safeti design in thi section we will first present the basic plan of safeti design target abnorm event that might occur in a reprocess plant and explain repres exampl of design such as radioact substanc confin design decai heat elimin design critic prevent design and fire prevent design next we will explain defens design against extern event such as earthquak and aircraft crash these safeti design follow the reprocess plant safeti inspect guidelin establish by the japan nuclear safeti commiss with safeti inspect of privat reprocess plant in mind a safeti design target intern event 1 basic plan safeti is ensur by adopt the follow principl of multi layer defens 1 prevent abnorm occurr by adopt technolog with demonstr high reliabl design toler into process and equip and select appropri materi in stage follow design thi is done by activ that guarante qualiti and by oper train and educ 2 prevent the spread and escal of abnorm occurr there is littl danger that such abnorm occurr will escal rapidli sinc reprocess plant oper condit temperatur pressur etc ar mild thu in most case there is ampl time for oper to detect abnorm occurr through warn sign and transfer process to a safe state howev in the prevent of accid with potenti major effect such as critic fire and explos a highli reliabl interlock system will ensur safeti automat when necessari 3 amelior effect from escal of abnorm occurr everi measur ha been taken to prevent the occurr and escal of abnorm situat but even if a situat were to escal countermeasur have been establish to amelior it effect so that the gener public will not be affect serious sup 3 if an abnorm situat escal the danger aris of releas of radioact substanc in aerosol form into the ventil system a countermeasur for all process to amelior the effect of abnorm situat that have escal is the design of high effici particul filter that will function unimpair even under abnorm condit and will remov virtual all of the aerosol and then releas it through an exhaust pipe with dilut and diffus effect see the next section confin design countermeasur to amelior specif effect includ critic prevent measur and fire extinguish equip incident dynam equip sup 4 that provid ani of the multi layer defens and that ar import for safeti ar design with independ and redund power sourc and circuit so that safeti perform is not impair if on break down 2 confin design we will us figur 2 to explain the design for confin of radioact solut as a typic exampl most of the major equip involv chemic process that us nitric acid thu the column tank and pipe ar made of materi stainless steel zirconium that ar highli resist to corros by nitric acid moreov wet section ar of weld construct for leak proof becaus the process us onli low temperatur and pressur it is almost inconceiv that a larg volum leak would occur assum that thi did occur howev a stainless steel receptacl for leak liquid ha been instal on the cell floor and along with thi there is a detect devic with which the oper can immedi detect the leak and recov the leakag in anoth sound tank the cell is further enclos in hous thi multi barrier construct make it imposs for the radioact solut to leak out to the extern environ figur 2 confin function diagram on the other hand column and tank ar link to the atmospher by column and tank exhaust ga dispos equip their ventil system and the cell and hous ar link separ to the atmospher by their own ventil system becaus the radioact substanc in solut ar non volatil onli a small percentag would enter the ventil system in aerosol form even under condit caus by an accid and it would be complet remov by high effici particul filter then releas through an exhaust pipe sinc air pressur is increasingli lower go from atmospher to hous to cell to column and tank radioact aerosol will not get out directli into the atmospher even if it diffus in the cell or hous it will go through high effici particul filter and then will be releas through the exhaust pipe in thi wai the ventil system ar design to be a safeti function that amelior effect on the environ even dure accid 3 decai heat elimin design most of the unseal radioact substanc handl in the plant exist in storag tank suppli tank receiv tank buffer tank that serv as temporari storag of radioact solut although radioact solut decai heat is rel low the most import safeti featur of these storag tank is decai heat elimin figur 3 show the structur of the concentr hlw liquid storag tank cool system which will be explain from the viewpoint of prevent of boil figur 3 configur of concentr to elimin decai heat two independ cool water system includ power system ar establish and oper in the storag tank five cool coil have been instal for each system but the necessari heat elimin actual can be done with four coil cool water is circul by a pump and releas of heat to the outsid is accomplish through an air fin cooler spare for these dynam equip ar in place so that the cool capabl of the system is not lost even if on piec of equip were to break down even if an abnorm situat escal and the cool capabl of on system is lost the remain system will run and the boil point will not be reach the extern power sourc receiv power through two circuit so there is no hindranc to power suppli even if there is an outag on on circuit to prepar against the possibl of outag on both circuit at the same time an emerg diesel gener ha been instal for each system moreov to improv power sourc reliabl power can also be receiv from a spare diesel gener also in emerg solut can be transfer to a spare storag tank that is normal empti becaus of thi veri tightli design system it is inconceiv that the cool capabl of the two independ system could be lost simultan or that thi state could continu for a number of hour so that the boil point would be reach a spent fuel storag pool cool water system two system structur and a gener cool water system have been set up which ar complet independ from the abovement storag tank cool water system these can also be us for cool the concentr hlw liquid storag tank 4 critic prevent design becaus the plant will reprocess spent fuel that wa burn at nuclear power plant there is essenti littl danger of critic in equip that handl spent fuel assembl or uranium howev each piec of equip ha been design to prevent critic sup 5 as a typic exampl of thi we will discuss equip us after plutonium mix and separ where that essenti argument doe not appli safeti design call total concentr safeti configur and measur control ha been appli to control the configur of column and tank through which plutonium solut flow so that critic will not be reach no matter how high plutonium concentr becom dure normal oper even for column and tank through which plutonium doe not flow dure normal oper safeti design call limit concentr safeti configur and measur control or concentr control ha been appli to ensur adequ toler and non critic below a certain concentr thu the latter critic safeti design becom import if solut flow from equip govern by total concentr safeti configur and measur control to equip govern by the other control figur 4 explain thi us the exampl of the washer mixer settler in the distributor figur 4 exampl of critic prevent design as explain in part ii plutonium is strip into the water phase in the distributor column howev a trace of plutonium remain in the organ phase flow to the next step the plutonium washer along with uranium where it come into contact with a reduc and is remov to the water phase side the distributor column is total concentr safeti configur and measur control equip wherea the plutonium washer is concentr control equip if suppli of reduc to the distributor column stop for sever hour the plutonium mai becom concentr and flow into the plutonium washer in highli concentr form howev an alarm is set off when reduc suppli stop and the oper can stop the process immedi or take other safeti measur even if thi wa neglect and develop into an abnorm situat the malfunct can be observ through multipl neutron detector instal in the distributor column for process monitor and the oper would have adequ time even at thi point to stop the process or take other safeti measur addition an interlock system ha been design to oper complet separ from oper respons as shown in figur 4 when neutron detector instal in the plutonium washer detect a high count rate that indic an inflow of highli concentr plutonium an alarm is set off and at the same time process is automat shut down thi interlock system s high reliabl is ensur by independ and redund power sourc gaug cutoff valv etc as describ abov there is ampl time for oper respons and beyond that a highli reliabl interlock system ha been instal it is therefor inconceiv that critic will occur 5 fire prevent design a flammabl organ solvent is us in the extract process fire prevent design is import becaus if a fire broke out some radioact substanc might be carri by smoke and get into the ventil system and be releas into the atmospher environ therefor the safeti design describ below will ensur that the three condit requir for fire to occur 1 solvent leak from the contain to the cell 2 the solvent not be recov and heat up to the flash point 74 c and 3 ignit of the solvent which ha reach flash point will not be fulfil as state in earlier section column tank and pipe ar built to prevent leak but should a leak occur the solvent would be recov immedi and could not be releas while there ar column or tank that heat and us solvent the temperatur is limit to 50 c and the heat sourc is not near the receptacl for leakag it is therefor difficult to conceiv of the temperatur of ani leak solvent rise to the flash point no equip that could be an ignit sourc is place in the cell and equip also ar ground to prevent static discharg thi design prevent fire but on the assumpt of the possibl of a fire outbreak fire detector have been instal there ar fire prevent damper that can cut off air flow into the cell and ga extinguish also have been provid b safeti design against extern event 1 earthquak proof design build system and equip hereaft call the facil have been separ into three class a b and c in order of import from the viewpoint of effect of radioact on

and intern secur text a high level us deleg to includ repres of congress and the depart of energi will arriv in russia in mai to consult on the issu of shut down nuclear reactor in the close citi of tomsk 7 and krasnoyarsk 26 thi visit by american govern expert is take place within the framework of agreement reach between chernomyrdin and gore in decemb 1993 regard the creation of a joint work group to studi and develop a number of issu connect with nuclear arm reduct dure the mai visit there ar plan to studi opportun for achiev greater transpar and irrevers in nuclear arm reduct and place civilian plutonium and surplu militari plutonium under monitor discuss the technic detail of mutual inspect of site where part made of fission materi ar store and discuss possibl mean of util plutonium to prevent it accumul thi is a multifacet issu and involv not onli technolog aspect but seriou polit aspect as well by the mid 1980 s the nuclear arsen creat by the former soviet union and the unit state dure the cold war total more than 60 000 nuclear warhead of that number more than on half belong to the ussr the process of nuclear disarma begun by the two superpow and the develop of that process in which the collaps ussr place ha been taken by russia will result in a sharp reduct in the size of that arsen in complianc with the start i and start ii treati the total number of strateg warhead retain by each side must not exce 3 500 by the year 2003 take into consider unilater pledg to reduc tactic nuclear weapon over the next decad russia and the unit state will have to destroi sever ten of thousand of warhead the result will be a sharp reduct in the threat of nuclear war accord to variou estim the process of destroi nuclear warhead will result in russia and the unit state free up a total of approxim 900 metric ton of highli enrich uranium and more than 100 metric ton of weapon grade plutonium approxim 50 metric ton for each countri these two materi ar the basi for the manufactur of nuclear deton devic it take 3 5 kg of plutonium to make a singl nuclear devic and three or four time that much highli enrich uranium therefor acquisit of these materi is a prioriti goal for state seek to acquir nuclear weapon the exist of surplu fission materi present a threat both to russian and us nation secur and to world secur retent of those materi retain the possibl that thei will be us to make nuclear weapon again therebi undermin the irrevers of nuclear disarma effort the emerg of ani crisi in russian american relat could quit easili provok a resurrect of the nuclear arm race therefor the goal should be the perman remov of these materi from the militari realm for russia the situat is made more difficult by intern polit instabl slacken of state monitor function and a difficult econom and environment situat consequ for it the choic of the optimum mean of util or destroi surplu weapon grade fission materi and monitor them is a task of prioriti import highli enrich uranium which consist primarili of the u 235 isotop mai be de enrich by mix it with natur uranium and then us in the product of fuel for the nuclear power industri an agreement ha been reach under which russia will sell the unit state uranium with an enrich level of 4 percent for the purpos of manufactur fuel within the framework of that agreement 500 metric ton of russian weapon grade uranium made avail through warhead elimin will be reprocess over a period of 20 year the valu of thi contract is in excess of 12 billion a separ agreement also provid for mutual monitor measur that will prevent russia from us uranium that doe not come from militari sourc and america from us the uranium for purpos not stipul in the contract thu there ar present no technic or polit obstacl to the util of weapon grade uranium plutonium is a differ matter neither russia nor the unit state current ha ani real mean of destroi it or util it realiz the nationwid scale of the plutonium issu and the fact that plutonium is on of the most close guard topic decis in regard to which ar made by a small group of expert i would like to direct public attent to thi matter as well plutonium is in the group of transuranium element and is number 94 in mendeleev s period tabl of element it doe not occur natur on earth and wa obtain by artifici mean the first sampl were creat by the seaborg group unit state in 1941 by bombard with neutron a uranium nucleu with a mass number of 238 just like u 235 plutonium 239 when it interact with neutron break down releas energi and neutron which ar essenti in maintain a nuclear chain reaction it is thi characterist that make it a strateg materi it is us to produc nuclear weapon and it small critic mass compar to u 235 make it prefer as a sourc of nuclear deton the toxic effect of plutonium on live organ is due to the alpha particl form when it decai alpha particl that enter live tissu destroi the tissu at the cellular level the radioact of on gram of weapon grade plutonium is approxim 0 7 curi therefor just 2 microgram of that type of plutonium in the bodi of a human be weigh 70 kg could prove fatal weapon grade plutonium is produc in special industri reactor with a low level of fuel combust these ar graphit water fuel channel type reactor with an output of around 2 000 megawatt there were 13 such reactor in the ussr russia five at chelyabinsk 65 five at tomsk 7 and three at krasnoyarsk 26 accord to variou estim the former ussr had produc approxim 150 metric ton of weapon grade plutonium there ar onli three reactor still in oper two at tomsk 7 and on at krasnoyarsk 26 but thei increas the quantiti of weapon grade plutonium for which russia no longer ha ani us by two metric ton a year plutonium can also be produc by ani nuclear power plant oper on ordinari uranium fuel but nuclear power plant reactor that have a high level of fuel burn up produc energi grade plutonium note that energi grade plutonium can also be us to made a nuclear deton devic all the technolog step involv in obtain plutonium ar accompani by the creation of a larg quantiti of liquid radioact wast the process of set up radiochem technolog and the oper thereof result in radioact contamin among other thing by plutonium of huge area where the radiochem product facil ar locat the mayak product associ in chelyabinsk oblast the siberian chemic combin at tomsk 7 and the krasnoyarsk mine and chemic combin at krasnoyarsk 26 restor these contamin area will requir a tremend amount of work accord to figur cite in american articl the product of a singl kilogram of weapon grade plutonium involv the creation of four cubic meter of liquid radioact wast with a radioact concentr of 2 yez expans unknown curi cubic meter and a plutonium concentr of 0 005 kg per cubic meter thu the former ussr product of 150 metric ton of weapon grade plutonium wa accompani by the creation of liquid radioact wast contain as much as half a billion curi of radioact a substanti portion of thi radioact wa pump into underground clai strata at tomsk 7 and krasnoyarsk 26 at the mayak combin these wast total 570 million curi ar store in steel contain the explos of on such contain in septemb 1957 result in the releas of 20 million curi of radiat into the environ and the radionuclid contamin of 23 000 sq km the popul of that area wa 272 000 more than on third of whom were subsequ resettl the current propos is that the store highli radioact wast left over from the defens program be vitrifi yet at thi time there is no reliabl function vitrif technolog plutonium s strateg signific and extrem high radioact requir a respons approach to it storag and the select of a mean of util it among the propos of variou mean of util weapon grade plutonium there ar two that ar prefer from the current standpoint us as fuel in nuclear power plant or vitrif along with the radioact wast creat dure it product with subsequ burial of the wast both these propos mean do not destroi the plutonium as such thei mere shift it from the weapon grade categori to reactor grade it is essenti to note that the greater portion of the plutonium produc in the world as of the present time by energi produc nuclear power station approxim 700 metric ton is contain in spent fuel it is assum that thi fuel s high level of radioact serv as a sort of physic self defens and prevent the extract of plutonium from it without highli develop technolog vitrif also reduc weapon grade plutonium to the standard for spent fuel at the present time none of the propos method ha ani convinc scientif technic or econom argument to support it therefor us of ani on of them will requir a preparatori period of at least 10 year in thi context cooper between variou organ in the unit state and russia aim at thoroughli studi all possibl mean of util plutonium appear highli desir it is worth note that the choic of a mean of util weapon grade plutonium will also be influenc by such factor as the adopt of a concept for the fuel and energi cycl a number of countri franc belgium russia and until recent great britain japan and germani support the concept of a close fuel cycl but onli franc ha made some progress with regard to the us of extract plutonium to produc fuel as of the present time russia ha extract approxim 30 metric ton of energi grade plutonium which is store at the mayak combin howev in contrast to franc russia doe not current possess the abil to util it the util concept for weapon grade plutonium drawn up by the ministri of atom energi presum that it will be us as fuel within the framework of that concept there ar plan to util either exist vver 1000 reactor or the bn 800 fast neutron reactor that ar under construct at the south ural atom power station it is possibl that special design thermal reactor will also be us vver 1000 reactor could be us to denatur weapon grade plutonium us a 30 percent mox fuel charg mox fuel is made from a mixtur of slightli enrich uranium and plutonium howev extens preliminari work will be necessari to assess the capabl of reactor control and protect system and to analyz the effect of possibl accid furthermor russia doe not have an exist enterpris produc mox fuel for the vver 1000 and construct of the rt 2 complex at krasnoyarsk 26 ha been suspend nor can the idea of us fast neutron reactor be implement immedi due to the lack of such reactor the exist bn 600 reactor us uranium fuel and bn 800 reactor ar still under construct complex 300 at the mayak combin design to produc mox fuel for bn 800 reactor is current in a state of 50 percent readi the unit state support the concept of an open fuel cycl and current reject reprocess primarili for two reason 1 reprocess would encourag the prolifer of nuclear weapon and 2 the us of uranium to produc fuel for power reactor is current much more econom than the us of plutonium although the unit state doe not preclud the possibl of reprocess fuel in the futur at the present time it ha no desir to signal that weapon grade plutonium ha ani signific as an energi sourc therebi give the nuclear power industri hope of receiv addit govern subsidi for the develop and construct of a new gener of nuclear reactor thu both countri will be forc to store their plutonium for a fairli long period of time we should note that storag is an expens undertak accord to variou estim the cost of store a singl gram of plutonium is 1 00 2 00 per year moreov russia accord to statement by ministri of atom energi offici doe not possess an appropri storag facil creat difficulti both with regard to the warhead disassembl process and the implement of reliabl monitor the cost of build an appropri storag facil is estim at sever hundr of million of dollar respond to request from russian offici the us senat ha pass a special act under which russia will be alloc 400 million to help with disassembl of it warhead the so call nunn lugar bill howev thi bill state that the monei mai be us onli upon receipt of convinc evid that russia will not us the materi thu made avail to produc new nuclear warhead and that the unit state will have the right to monitor the nuclear weapon dismantl process in russia wherea the first condit seem quit reason and accept the second ha clearli discriminatori overton and is unlik to be accept by russia in that form the solut might be an agreement on mutual monitor the primari argument in favor of that approach is the fact that agreement regard mutual monitor of nuclear arsen will provid a solid polit foundat upon which to strengthen the nuclear non prolifer system and get the other nuclear countri involv in the nuclear disarma process howev achiev of a comprehens agreement includ provis of complet inform on nuclear weapon arsen the full amount of fission materi produc and the process of nuclear weapon storag and destruct will requir much time and could thu have an effect on the rate of destruct therefor it would be more appropri to move toward that goal in stage by conclud a number of intermedi agreement on monitor of newli produc weapon grade plutonium on a complet halt to such product and on transfer under bilater monitor of a portion of the plutonium freed up by the process of warhead elimin at the present time both side ar conduct consult toward thi end achiev of these agreement could creat a good foundat for progress on the issu of monitor the disassembl of warhead slate for destruct and in the direct of a full scale exchang of data regard nuclear arsen on possibl solut to the issu of a russian storag facil could be to conclud a bilater russian american agreement on the transfer of surplu weapon grade plutonium in both countri to bilater or intern control under the aegi of the intern atom energi agenc thi would make it possibl to resolv issu rel to the fund of it construct and creat certainti about reliabl storag and monitor of surplu weapon grade plutonium until such time as reliabl mean of

articl by shinichi kawarada director nuclear power back end promot offic scienc and technolog agenc excerpt 1 foreword in thi articl i will discuss polici trend and futur develop concern dispos of high level radioact wast hlw which is of particular interest recent to the nation my own person opinion have been incorpor into thi present 2 characterist of hlw and amount gener in japan hlw refer to wast liquid that ha been separ in the process of extract uranium and plutonium in the reprocess of spent fuel in other countri howev hlw mai refer to the spent fuel itself that is in japan and franc nuclear fuel is recycl to make the most effect us of resourc but in countri such as the unit state canada and sweden hlw refer to the spent fuel itself in compar the two it is found that after process the former type of hlw is more compact and contain less radioact also in term of the period of continu radioact which depend mainli on the amount of tru transuran nuclid in the hlw the former type of hlw allow more ration control of radioact wast and is more appropri from the viewpoint of environment protect the amount of hlw gener is extrem small compar to other non specif wast if half of the electr on japanes us in a lifetim 80 year is gener by nuclear energi the amount of hlw creat in the process is about the size of three golf ball on the other hand hlw is extrem radioact becaus it contain a larg amount of fission product and it gener heat also while small in volum it includ tru nuclid with veri long half life at present the onli hlw gener in japan is at the tokai reprocess plant of the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corpor pnc and 516 cubic meter had been gener as of the end of march 1993 thi is store safe in tank at the plant furthermor japan nuclear fuel is build a commerci reprocess plant in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur and from the year 2000 hlw is expect to be gener from oper of that plant also the electr power compani current have contract with great britain and franc for spent fuel reprocess servic and the uranium and plutonium recov from the reprocess along with the hlw is to be return to japan the forecast volum of hlw that will be gener in the futur take all of these factor into consider and will be chang substanti by the reprocess plan and the scale of nuclear power gener in the futur but it is thought that the volum will be 40 000 to 50 000 vitrifi unit of hlw in the 2030s to 2040s when dispos site ar expect to be in oper consequ measur that deal with these characterist must be taken to dispos of thi volum of hlw thi mean solidifi hlw which is gener in the form of wast liquid into a safe form cool the solidifi hlw until it is in a dispos state and dispos of the hlw in a form that can be isol for a long time so that it doe not affect the human live environ 3 basic hlw dispos polici figur 1 hlw storag japan s basic measur to deal with hlw liquid gener in spent fuel reprocess includ a solidifi hlw into a stabl form glass b store it for 30 to 50 year for cool and 3 dispos of it in deep strata sever hundr meter underground geolog dispos mani foreign countri us the same dispos method the follow ar the gener step to be taken to implement the basic measur a establish the technolog to vitrifi the hlw liquid b decid on a storag facil site and build a facil where the vitrifi hlw can be store c carri out r d to establish technolog need for dispos and along with thi decid on a dispos site and safe dispos of the hlw first vitrif technolog is in actual us in franc and great britain in japan cold test oper is underwai at the vitrif technolog develop facil tvf in pnc tokai work and hot test oper us real liquid wast is schedul for fy94 thu vitrif technolog can be consid as establish for all intent and purpos two storag facil ar be plan on is for storag of vitrifi hlw gener at pnc tokai reprocess plant thi will be on of the function of the storag engin center that pnc plan to build in horonob machi hokkaido at the invit of that town howev the site ha not gone smoothli due to opposit to the town s invit by the hokkaido governor and legislatur the second storag facil is for vitrifi hlw that will be return from great britain and franc as mention earlier thi facil alreadi is under construct at the japan nuclear fuel site in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur as for hlw dispos on 28 august 1992 the expert group on radioact wast of the japan atom energi commiss jaec releas a report entitl concern hlw countermeasur that describ a concret vision of how to proce with hlw countermeasur which had not necessarili been clear until that point in particular the report made clear the step timet and each organ s role and share of respons for dispos as a whole as head of the offic that serv as the secretariat that compil the report i wa most keenli awar that the report had to unveil befor the japanes peopl and gain their understand and cooper for hlw dispos to do so the report had to be highli transpar and includ in concret term the polici that should be taken and the timet that should be follow to achiev appropri and safe dispos of hlw in the futur hlw dispos flow in accord with the long term plan for develop and us of nuclear energi which wa set forth by the jaec in june 1987 the step prior to implement of geolog dispos of hlw ar to proce in four phase select of effect strata phase 1 select of prospect dispos site phase 2 demonstr of dispos technolog at the prospect dispos site phase 3 and construct oper and shutdown of the dispos facil phase 4 at present we ar in phase 2 schedul for thi phase ar r d aim at establish dispos technolog and on the other hand select of the prospect dispos site by the dispos project s primari implement to be form at an appropri date base on overal consider of such factor as the result of r d social condit and region condit howev the wai phase 2 wa set up gave the mistaken impress that the result of r d will be directli link to the process of select the prospect dispos site and it is believ that thi wa on hindranc to the site of the r d facil which is not realli directli relat to the dispos site select process for thi reason the two were describ separ in the report to make it clear that dispos and r d ar to be advanc concurr in the futur instead of explain thing in a conceptu manner in term of the four phase we want to explain thing concret by show individu process thi will ensur that there will be no misunderstand 4 hlw dispos implement figur 3 step in hlw geolog dispos what must be consid when carri out the dispos is when where and how to carri out the dispos project industri wast gener dure industri activ normal is process and and dispos of by the parti that creat the wast in accord with the law concern wast process and cleanup which state the principl that the wast creator is respons for dispos in the case of hlw howev due to the length of time need for dispos and the safeti requir the nation govern must plai a certain role in addit to the electr power compani the wast creator thi is clearli a more activ govern respons regard industri wast than set forth in the abovement law to implement the dispos project smoothli and without confus the first thing to do is clarifi the work share of the govern and the privat sector the follow is the dispos project framework in the order given in the report 1 govern and privat sector workshar certainli the govern and privat sector must work as on in carri out the necessari measur for dispos but thi will not be effect if respons and role ar not clear the nation govern the electr power compani and pnc ar the three parti involv and the report separ their role as follow a the nation govern is respons for appropri and complet dispos and it also will draw up the polici need to advanc the dispos project smoothli b the electr power compani ar call upon to cover the cost of dispos and also to carri out a role in the r d stage that fulli reflect their respons as the hlw creator c for the present pnc will be call upon to implement steadili survei of the geolog environ and r d pnc role is easi to understand becaus it involv r d without direct involv in the dispos itself there mai be those who ar not quit sure about the relationship between the govern and the electr power compani howev and i want to supplement the abov with some of my own observ the electr power compani natur must take respons as the wast creator but as state earlier in view of the work involv in hlw dispos the long term natur of the dispos and other circumst the relationship wa set up in thi wai becaus it wa desir that in addit to the respons of the electr power compani as the wast creator the govern also bear respons for appropri and complet dispos and for draw up measur such as new legal measur and region promot measur if need to proce smoothli with the dispos project you mai be wonder exactli what appropri and complet involv i believ that thei includ the follow appropri probabl involv ensur that the form and method of dispos ar appropri and safe thu in term of form geolog dispos is state as govern polici and in term of method the govern ha indic that it polici is to carri out r d to ensur that the method us for geolog dispos ar appropri and safe and ha design pnc and the primari research organ that will take the lead in carri out the r d incident final assur of safeti probabl will be through safeti inspect by the govern complet mean that the dispos will be carri out thoroughli over what is expect to be a long period of time that is why the govern must be respons for guarante the perman of the primari implement of the dispos and for provid the system need to carri out dispos thoroughli with cooper and understand from the peopl 2 time and form of primari dispos implement it ha been customari for the wast creator itself to dispos of the wast thi is actual the case for industri wast or for the wast creator to contract a wast expert to do it howev thing ar not that simpl in the case of hlw there certainli ar no nuclear wast dispos firm nor will there be in the near futur thu an appropri primari implement must be form base on the share role of the govern and the electr power compani as point out in part 1 abov although there ar some who believ that thi primari implement should be form immedi the report take the view that right now time should be us to make steadi advanc in r d on geolog dispos and in gain the understand of the japanes peopl it maintain that take variou circumst into consider the primari implement should be form around the year 2000 the report maintain that further studi is need regard the form of the primari implement the studi should consid such requir as guarante perman dispos respons of the wast creator and applic of the result of r d the report also express the think that the time ha come to begin to realli address dispos measur and point out that it is desir for the consult committe on hlw measur promot form in octob 1992 compos of three member the govern director gener of the scienc and technolog agenc s atom energi bureau and the director gener of miti agenc of natur resourc and energi the chairman of the feder of electr power compani and the presid of pnc to begin a studi immedi on the composit of the primari implement and for a preparatori organ to be form as soon as possibl 3 establish of high level project promot preparatori committe base on the abov recommend the consult committe on hlw measur promot carri out intens studi aim at immedi format of a preparatori bodi then establish a high level project promot preparatori committe on 29 mai 1993 the preparatori committe is subordin to the consult committe and ha it own secretariat the preparatori committe will not becom the primari implement automat jaec will review the result of the preparatori committe s studi from a comprehens viewpoint and base on that the primari implement will be establish as for the administr composit of the preparatori committe jaec member hayashi wa appoint the committe chairman and there ar nine other member includ a secretari gener as of 1 juli 1993 4 step lead to dispos graphic graphic of the seri of step and procedur lead to dispos the most import and difficult probabl is select of the dispos site select is to be done by the primari implement then approv by the govern the japanes peopl probabl ar most concern about three point when will the primari implement make the select and where will it be how will the decis be made and how will the peopl be involv in the select process the report natur doe not give the name of the site which is complet undecid it doe not give a select date becaus there ar undetermin factor regard the select procedur howev the report state that the primari implement will explain the dispos project to the local govern of the area around the prospect site and get it approv emphasi is given to get prior approv from the local resid in other word the the step of govern approv of the dispos site will not be taken if local approv ha not been receiv underli thi think is the hope that thi will dispel the suspicion of the local resid which aros when the deep strata research facil to be discuss later wa site that the facil would gradual be convert into the dispos site the report state that onc the site is set the primari implement will survei the featur of the site to determin it appropri and also will valid the dispos technolog the report also give a rough timet for the dispos project with the aim of begin oper of the dispos site from the 2030s or the mid 2040s at the latest the oper commenc date wa set by assum that the primari implement will be form around the year 2000 and then consid factor such as the time need for steadi implement of the dispos step futur reprocess program and other nuclear energi develop and the fact that the vitrifi hlw return from great britain and franc will be store 30 to 50 year for cool when will the dispos site be select there ar variou undetermin factor but around 2010 to 2015 wa presum in term of the schedul given in the report 5 dispos site control japan ha chosen geolog dispos as the method for dispos of hlw as have other countri that ar proceed with nuclear energi develop the reason is that the geolog dispos concept is base on safe dispos that doe not reli on futur gener to be respons for maintain the sound of the dispos system in other word geolog dispos is a concept that doe not reli on intern systemat control to ensur safeti after the site is shut down i e the hole that ha been dug is fill back up and return to it origin state on the other hand the peopl ar veri uneasi about the fact that geolog dispos remov the hlw from human control recogn thi the report maintain that introduc the idea of a control system for monitor and maintain record after shutdown of the dispos site would be on effect wai to gain the understand of the japanes peopl that is why studi from a technolog viewpoint should continu on the signific content and timefram of a control system the word control ha variou mean when refer to hlw thi ha caus some confus which need to be straighten out on case is when control is us in the sens of perman storag either abov or below ground of vitrifi hlw some peopl think that thi is good from the viewpoint of get the understand and concurr of the peopl but the polici ha been not to us that method becaus it is not desir to burden futur gener and becaus geolog dispos which even goe as far as refil the dispos site is more appropri from the viewpoint of ensur safeti for an extrem long time a second mean is control from the time that a site for geolog dispos is open to the time it is refil the period of thi control is estim to be from 10 to 100 year the effect on the surround environ by the hlw that ha been firmli fix into underground strata can be check adequ dure that period and if there is ani problem it is even possibl to withdraw the hlw moreov sinc shutdown of the dispos site is done after a full check on whether safeti can be assur for an extrem long time it is inconceiv that troubl would aris after shutdown a third mean is control after shutdown of the dispos site thi is the control that is mention in the report the concept of geolog dispos is that safeti after shutdown of the dispos site will not depend on a control system after the shutdown thu control after shutdown is not requir to ensur safeti howev becaus there probabl ar those who feel uneasi about not have ani control after the shutdown it ha been maintain that futur studi is need on what sort of control system would be appropri in term of gain the peopl s understand at that time it will be necessari to consid the will and the attitud of the peopl and thereaft a sociolog approach will be import thu on possibl approach would be to carri out a question and answer survei 6 r d implement progress in r d creat a foundat for dispos implement and steadi implement of r d and wide knowledg about it progress is extrem import in order to gain the peopl s understand and cooper for geolog dispos furthermor sinc r d extend over a long period of time the govern must render judgment on the adequaci of r d at everi stage of new discoveri pnc ha been the primari research institut conduct r d relat to geolog dispos and last septemb it compil and publish it r d achiev in the technic report of hlw geolog dispos r d first report the major reaction of the parti involv wa that progress so far ha been good in that the r d result have clarifi the technolog base for work to be done to ensur the safeti of geolog dispos and that henceforth emphasi should be on investig research on condit in the geolog environ and if possibl data should be provid concern actual deep underground strata in specif locat jaec confirm the progress achiev in each of three research area investig research on condit in the geolog environ r d on dispos technolog and perform assess research and it express prais for the overal sound of the research thi wa provid in a report entitl concern the state of progress of hlw dispos r d the conclus in a nutshel wa that the r d describ in thi technolog report wa advanc in an appropri steadi manner and that it could be conclud at thi stage to be gener sound jaec also list the geolog dispos r d issu to be address in the futur in each of the abovement three research area and further point out the import of a deep strata research facil as a matter share by the three disciplin the second report is schedul to be compil befor the year 2000 even the time of thi report is consid veri signific and jaec will set up an evalu committe to assess it a matter of interest to mani of the concern parti is whether the result of research at the deep strata research facil can be includ in the second report no definit outlook can be given at thi time becaus it greatli depend on progress in the site of the storag engin center project pnc ha been work on thi after get an invit from horonob machi in hokkaido even if substanti progress wa to be made soon on the site and the decis to build the deep strata research facil were to be made a preliminari survei requir about two year would be necessari consid such time restraint it is doubt that much signific data could be contribut to the report nevertheless even if that data will not be readi the plan is to have measur of the artifici barrier virtual complet by that time data also can be expect from on site test be conduct in kamaishi citi iwat prefectur and the geolog dispos basic research facil in pnc tokai work that ha been oper on a full scale sinc octob 1993 thu the report will have fairli substant content 7 deep strata research facil the most import and urgent task that need to be carri out in r d concern geolog dispos from the viewpoint of dispos of vitrifi hlw is to acquir physic and chemic data on what sort of environ actual exist in the deep underground strata especi the characterist of base rock and the natur and flow of ground water to do thi a deep strata research facil need to be establish as soon as possibl advanc consider also should be given to open up the facil to all who ar interest and make it possibl for peopl to observ the actual deep strata pnc is suppos to establish thi research facil but as state earlier the storag engin center project which includ the deep strata research facil and is slate to be built in horonob machi hokkaido is oppos by the governor and legislatur of hokkaido the main reason for the opposit is the suspicion that onc the site of the storag engin center is approv the surround area automat will becom the final dispos site to dispel thi suspicion the report state clearli the govern s polici that plan of the deep strata research facil and the dispos site will be clearli separ i e the deep strata research facil will not automat becom the dispos site also as mention earlier the primari implement must get prior approv from the local resid when select the dispos site thu if the primari implement should at some point in time approach the local resid about convert the deep strata research facil into a dispos site and if thi wa reject it would be imposs to establish the dispos site there i therefor am confid that thi suspicion can be laid to rest the report also state that the geolog featur of japan make it desir to have multipl deep strata research facil the geolog featur of japan can be divid into two broad categori sedimentari rock base and crystallin rock base sinc the actual dispos site ha not be decid at least on research for each of these type of rock base must be establish the horonob area ha sedimentari rock base strata so anoth research facil must be establish in anoth area for crystallin rock base deep strata 8 cover dispos cost and region co exist the report state that in term of the principl that the wast creator should bear a fair share of the dispos cost ensur fund to cover the cost should begin at an earli date it also point out that the time ha come to estim the ration cost as soon as possibl and base on that estim draw up concret plan for ensur fund to cover the cost total cost of dispos base on estim by other countri for their dispos project probabl will be around sever trillion yen at current price when the concret cost becom clear an imag of the dispos site will be form and thi will contribut to increas the peopl s awar of the necess of the dispos undertak when address region co exist the report separ the dispos site from the deep strata research facil first with regard to the prospect dispos site the report sai that the variou survei will take a long time and will be follow by a long period of construct and oper of the dispos site and it therefor would be desir to conduct studi on how to proce with region promot in accord with the actual state of the dispos site includ system improv the report then point out that the studi should cover the creation of a new region promot system not just improv of the exist system which is base on the three principl of power resourc the report also sai that a studi of a region promot plan for the deep strata research facil is need as well and that from the viewpoint of effect us of underground space multipl us of the facil should be studi as well 9 omit 10 futur topic the govern ha work activ on the develop and us of nuclear energi but it is a fact that it ha encount all sort of critic in the cours of do so regardless of thi critic a record of safe oper of nuclear power plant ha been built and thi ha becom a part of our live until now there wa a great deal of critic about the safeti of nuclear power gener but critic recent ha focus on the nuclear fuel recycl polici and the radioact wast dispos polici it is believ that there ar two main reason for thi on is the domest reason the emphasi of nuclear energi relat undertak is shift from nuclear power gener to the nuclear fuel cycl the other is the intern reason with the breakdown of the cold war structur attent ha focus on the issu of dismantl of nuclear weapon and the extract of plutonium which ha arisen becaus of reduct of us and russian nuclear arsen and on the relat issu of pollut by nuclear weapon manufactur facil plutonium us is not the subject of thi articl so i will not go into it in detail nevertheless as long as nuclear power gener is carri out plutonium and other actinid inevit will be gener in the reactor nuclear fission of some of the plutonium take place in the reactor and as part of fuel constantli contribut to the gener of electr power the plutonium problem cannot be ignor so long as nuclear power gener is promot it is import to accept thi fact and consid how to deal with thi problem in the futur much of the recent critic about radioact wast is on hlw dispos which ha becom the focu of interest with progress on the nuclear fuel cycl undertak in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur the critic is that we should not proce with the nuclear fuel cycl undertak when there ar no clear prospect for the final hlw dispos site while it is true that the final dispos site is total undecid not on countri in the world that is pursu nuclear energi develop and us ha set up or start build a final dispos site howev it is essenti natur to clearli establish a plan of the process and step lead to construct and oper of a final site awar of the abov the report set forth a futur path base on the progress made so far on hlw countermeasur and point that have been reconsid consequ henceforth it is crucial that polici follow thi path be implement steadili specif polici that should be taken first of all ar a the high level project promot preparatori committe should carri out full scale public relat activ concern the sound and safeti of hlw dispos b steadi progress should be made on r d to ensur that geolog dispos will be sound and safe it is especi import to put maximum effort into establish the deep strata research facil at an earli date becaus it can contribut greatli not onli to advanc of r d but also to public relat activ in thi connect the storag engin center must be realiz at an earli date the content of the project can be divid into the function of temporari storag of the vitrifi hlw unit and the function of the deep strata research facil but sinc these two ar packag togeth there is concern that the center automat will becom the dispos site in the futur there also is suspicion base on a varieti of past circumst that is why a propos by the local govern of horonob machi is consid on wai to deal with the situat that is go ahead and build the deep strata research facil becaus it will be a cold plant that will not handl radioact materi but hold storag relat facil

in gener term vs smorodintsev deputi chairman of the committe character the situat in the oblast for us as follow the southern ural area ha been declar an ecolog disast zone in 1957 there wa a radiat discharg or more precis a nuclear explos at a warehous for radioact wast at the mayak plant as we learn from the local resid it wa at thi plant that kurchatov made hi bomb and the plant had been built by beriya on stalin s person order and then four year after the generalissimo s death hi mustach shadow cover chelyabinsk sverdlovsk and kurgan oblast with a radioact cloud now the situat ha stabil in the mayak area the plutonium reactor have been shut down and read ar normal but the techa river and vur eastern ural radiat trace will be danger for anoth 300 year thi is realli enough to last for our ag and for our children and our grandchildren the area ha been surround by barb wire and take in water swim and graze livestock have been prohibit then the electr locomot engin told us that not all of

to be sure thei cut the fish s head off in the belief that in fish most of the radiat is in the head becaus it dig into the radioact sand and the rest goe into the soup there is a joke from the area of black humor about the local fish soup three fishermen were cook fish soup on the techa river thei were eat the soup with their vodka two of them drank the vodka but on of them did not drink ani and di as we know alcohol help elimin certain radionuclid the plant s reactor were shut down but in the settl tank were 300 million cubic meter of radioact water and what if the dam were to break it would be wors than chernobyl but the most terrifi thing is the zone of the plant on recal the strugatskii brother stalker true there wa no radiat in the zone in the novel but in the sanitari exclus zone of mayak there ar more than 500 000 tonn of radioact wast now thei have begun to bake it into glass to weld it shut in steel contain and pour concret over it the danger ha diminish besid we learn from

capac at sizewel b the larg pressuris water reactor near complet on the suffolk coast to hous spent fuel for half the plant s plan 40 year life ne posit is that while reprocess is appropri for older plant such as magnox becaus the spent fuel is corros it is an expens option for newer technolog which discharg more manag wast germani ha abandon plan to build a reprocess plant for a varieti of econom and environment reason the us is not even contempl reprocess govern polici is to develop a long term fuel repositori under yucca mountain in nevada but the project ha encount such strong environment resist that it mai never come about the us depart of energi sai that explor of the site will take at least seven more year the case for reprocess ha tradition rest on three point on is militari it produc the plutonium need for nuclear weapon the onli reprocess that ha taken place in the us and the former soviet union is for militari purpos the bulk of these countri spent nuclear

a few measur which ar not costli you can forget it for a gener that s veri comfort but you have no final solut the more technic argument for reprocess is the extract of plutonium although the militari requir is declin plutonium remain an essenti fuel for fast breeder reactor but the fast breeder ha an uncertain futur the uk ha just decid to ceas fund it prototyp at dounreai in franc the nuclear instal inspector ha block a restart of the troubl superphenix reactor which is spearhead the french fast breeder programm at the moment onli japan ha a signific fast breeder programm which give it a reason to proce with the rokkasho mura plant mr masato nakamura of the nuclear fuel divis of the atom energi bureau sai we have never consid storag in place of reprocess our view is that japan is a resourc poor nation so we have to make us of a valuabl materi an altern us for plutonium is in mix oxid fuel mox a cocktail of fuel includ plutonium which can be us in convent nuclear power station up to 25 french station could us it accord to mr gobert even so thi potenti sourc of demand for plutonium mai not justifi the expens of reprocess becaus of the larg surplu of plutonium which is build up the uranium institut a trade group estim that us and russian stockpil of plutonium amount to more than 200 tonn and of highli enrich uranium to about 1 000 tonn increasingli though the debat about reprocess turn on environment consider the critic of reprocess emphasis the danger of transport nuclear wast sometim half wai round the world to the reprocess site the radiat risk at the site itself and the fact that reprocess still leav an end product to be dispos although both bnf and cogema oper a polici of return the process wast to their client thei onli ship back high level wast becaus it is easier and safer to transport to compens for the smaller volum thei ship back slightli more high level wast than thei take in but thi still leav them with bulki low level wast to dispos of so even though neither sellafield nor la hagu is strictli a nuclear dustbin where foreign client can dump their nuclear rubbish and forget about it both site have to store consider amount of wast mr gobert reject the accus that the act of reprocess actual add to the wast he sai that up3 the newest facil at la hagu produc no more wast than direct dispos and we know we can do better than that mr guin sai what we ar do is social desir we ar also make quit a lot of monei take the longer view our children will be mighti grate that we have taken thi cours howev both the uk and franc do have to have final storag site for the end product of reprocess in the uk thi is the respons of nirex a compani jointli own by the govern and the nuclear industri which is try to obtain permiss for a deep underground site next to sellafield despit the misgiv about reprocess it is unlik that their state owner will take a neg view of sellafield and la hagu both plant have been financ with monei from their client so thei place no burden on state budget and their bulg order book promis healthi export earn for mani year both compani make profit although the adequaci of their return will not be fulli test until
