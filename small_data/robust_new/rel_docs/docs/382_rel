capabl of draw maximum output mere switch to spark plug with a heat valu suit to engin requir is suffici it is thu demonstr that re possess a structur which is fundament easili adapt to hydrogen engin for which prevent abnorm combust is the most import concern nonetheless the 75 of gasolin specif output obtain even through oper at the theoret air fuel ratio is low likewis sinc air and hydrogen ar

FBIS4-20567: cso articl by a kishi mazda technic research center yokohama text 1 introduct as the econom recess continu a social re examin seem to be take place with regard to give consum the kind of product and servic that thei realli want i believ that in time such as thi there is more of a demand for authent product and technolog what i mean here by authent is provid a basic valu for good purchas that give the averag custom a sens of satisfact to meet these need requir matur technolog that show an understand of the consum and what thei want the matur technolog refer to here ar consum technolog that essenti solv the problem that peopl consid import to them for that reason i think that we ar enter a time in which research institut that have stockpil mani differ technolog will be ask to lead the wai therefor in thi paper i would like to introduc the mazda technic research center and in do so discuss what it is do to address these new social trend 2 research center profil the first technic research center that mazda establish to concentr on new technolog wa in 1985 at it headquart in hiroshima and then in 1987 it ad the yokohama technic research center in yokohama the basic idea behind open the technic research center here in yokohama wa to us the slogan at the time build an automobil cultur what thi mean is not treat the car simpli as a mean of travel but treat it as on of the essenti element of societi and cultur that peopl need when the research center initi receiv word of thi new slogan the research center at mazda headquart in hiroshima decid to put it emphasi on new technolog that were directli relat to the develop of car type wherea the research center in yokohama decid it would focu on basic technolog in advanc field orient toward automobil technolog of the 21st centuri at present the two research center ar exchang idea and deepen ti with on anoth base on respect area of expertis and ar steadili plai more import role as the core place within mazda for develop new technolog next befor we get into specif research activ i would like to discuss my own view regard research 3 person view regard research research institut ar at the pinnacl of research and develop and have an import mission in develop and explor consum technolog for that reason i feel that research institut have to reflect the long term and medium term need of consum in their research with that in mind i would like to take the opportun here to state the direct i believ that consum trend ar go until now compani have stress high valu ad car that offer more in the wai of divers perform and function in the futur howev there will probabl be a shift from superfici enjoy need to more basic enjoy need the need for exampl to maintain respect for human life whether on s own or other is grow ever more stronger in term of both product safeti and the environ for exampl someth ha to be done about the more than 10 000 peopl a year that die in auto accid and the other problem that exist such as environment pollut caus by carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid and also find other energi altern to petroleum these problem ar an immedi and futur threat to ourselv our famili and our children and ar caus for concern these ar essenti problem that have to do with the car itself so if we ar to resolv these issu we must steadili stockpil those technolog with an ey toward the futur with that said i would now like to introduc some area of research to show the work we ar do in tackl some of these problem 4 research activ outlin in thi section i have divid the research activ into environ friendli and peopl friendli research and focus in on particular research project in each area from the perspect discuss abov of address the basic need of todai s consum 4 1 environ friendli technolog what we mean here by environ friendli technolog ar those technolog for solv the environment and energi resourc problem we ar like to face in the 21st centuri more specif it mean those technolog concern with develop energi altern to petroleum and those technolog concern with recycl that try to limit exhaust ga emiss by research new combust method for reduc carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid emiss and make effect us of resourc 1 technolog for develop energi substitut i would like to start by talk about the hydrogen rotari engin automobil hr x thi car wa develop to convei the imag of an urban type commut car to be us in a 21st centuri environ restor with light and greeneri figur 1 figur not reproduc is a photograph of the hr x car a hydrogen rotari engin is a clean engin that burn hydrogen and is revolutionari in the sens that it doe not emit carbon dioxid nor destroi natur cycl more recent we develop a prototyp model of that car outfit with a hydrogen fuel cell and successfulli test drove it for the first time figur 2 figur not reproduc is a photograph of the hydrogen fuel cell car thi car enabl us to clarifi a number of technic issu have to do with outfit a car such as thi and took us on step closer toward achiev the goal of a futur societi base on hydrogen fuel car 2 technolog for control exhaust ga emiss in term of research on engin we ar research the composit of fuel mixtur and combust mechan us a varieti of method includ both visual and comput base in try to chang the flame propag process we have been do research on a peripher combust process that caus the spark ignit to occur from the peripheri of the cylind us thi techniqu we were abl to reduc nitrou oxid emiss dramat and bring about a major improv in lean burn combust that research receiv the asahara academ achiev award at the 42nd japan societi of automot engin confer 3 recycl technolog we ar also do research on materi in term of recycl which includ both metal and plastic and in so do have develop a recycl plastic composit made of a plastic fiber reinforc liquid crystal polym we now have the abil to recycl plastic composit that were onc virtual imposs to recycl and ar abl to make more effect us of our resourc 4 2 peopl friendli technolog what we mean here by peopl friendli technolog ar those technolog concern with understand the need of the driver and passeng and those concern with improv safeti in order to make the automobil societi we live in more enjoy and troubl free 1 prevent safeti we ar involv in a number of research project on advanc technolog concern with prevent accid on of these involv a safe drive support system and anoth a road traffic commun system the safe drive support system is a system that act as a back up in case of driver error and the commun system is a system for provid driver with safeti inform about the road for exampl in the safe drive support system project we ar do research on automat brake and a white line recognit method in figur 3 figur not reproduc we show the test car we ar us in our research on white line recognit by imag process mount in the trunk of the car is a high speed comput program to recogn road featur 2 human technolog we ar also make headwai in research on a driver simul in order to elucid the drive psycholog and behavior characterist of driver in figur 4 we show a gener draw of the drive simul with a driver on board the drive simul is expect to be us as a tool for elucid caus of auto accid and also as a tool for research drive characterist of beginn and older driver figur 4 gener draw of drive simul we have also been do research on wai to evalu driver alert by measur brain wave so that we can take those habit into account when design the insid of the car so as to make it harder for the driver to fall asleep figur 5 figur not reproduc show an experi be conduct to ascertain the relationship between brain wave signal and delai respons in human due to decreas alert person be test in

is ration the weight of the exist steel bodi will be reduc onli by sever percent at best gener whenev sheet steel and aluminum alloi part ar us togeth the joint ar attack by corros that result from the contact of dissimilar metal the corros is commonli call galvan corros and such joint have to be avoid altogeth in auto bodi construct therefor auto bodi part in which aluminum alloi can be us ar limit to such part as front hood trunk lid and hing part that function as a lid such as quickli detach sun roof otherwis like the nsx sport car of honda motor co ltd all the bodi ha to be made with an aluminum alloi with onli the smallest area of contact with steel nissan solv the problem of contact corros between steel and aluminum alloi for the aq x by insert steel aluminum alloi clad piec in the joint the steel aluminum alloi clad piec ar insert between an aluminum alloi outer panel and a steel inner panel when thei ar to be spot weld to form a monocoqu bodi the aluminum alloi layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel and the steel layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the steel inner panel befor the entir assembl is spot weld as a result aluminum is weld to aluminum and steel is weld to steel as a whole the aluminum outer panel and the steel inner panel ar bond to each other nissan is us the same cold roll steel panel spcd spce as

onli on spot weld voltag is requir for spot weld steel to steel as well as aluminum to aluminum yoshitaka kurihara chief research at the vehicular research laboratori of nissan s gener research institut sai thi we chose the ratio of the aluminum alloi to the steel in the clad materi in such a wai that on voltag can do both weld job simultan clad materi have two atom layer of dissimilar metal arrang tightli next to each other so no air can infiltr between the two layer thu neither oxid nor reduct take place as a result no potenti differ is gener between the steel and aluminum alloi layer and that prevent ani corros process from take place between the two dissimilar metal nissan improv the bodi rigid of the aq x through both design and materi and accord to kurihara both bend and twist rigid ar 20 percent higher than those of previou car of the same class nissan successfulli prevent ani loss of rigid despit the incorpor of aluminum the gaug of the aluminum alloi sheet like that of previou aluminum alloi part wa made 1 4 time that of the sheet steel to maintain the same tensil rigid as that of a sheet steel bodi the separ of steel from aluminum in an auto bodi the critic process in the recycl of car to be dispos of wa made technic possibl by nissan for the aq x by heat to approxim 500 c a brittl intermetal compound is form at the interfac of the steel and aluminum alloi layer of the clad materi which make it easi to separ the two layer with light impact nissan believ that the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur is a weight reduct technolog with a high probabl of implement becaus the advantag of weight reduct can be balanc against the ad cost through the optim of the ratio of cheap sheet steel to lightweight aluminum alloi accord to kurihara as far as the cost problem is concern although it is difficult to make a thorough assess at thi time it appear that a certain cost increas is unavoid not onli doe the aluminum alloi cost approxim three time as much as the steel the ratio of the materi unit price x the ratio of the densiti but the product cost is also high for the aluminum alloi becaus the spot weld electrod s life is shorter for the alloi than for steel audi

thi asf model for the mass test product of the a8 which is to replac the current sold luxuri v8 the a8 is schedul to be introduc to the german market in mai 1994 although the price of the a8 ha not been announc it ha been rumor that the price will exce the price of the v8 of 11 4 million it is specul that the car could afford an all aluminum alloi bodi becaus of it high price statu and the moder product rate of approxim 2 400 vehicl per month most of todai s passeng car have a monocoqu bodi that function as the structur materi for outer and inner panel in contrast the frame alon of the space frame structur function as the structur compon for the bodi and outer panel ar primarili us as the exterior partit therefor the space frame structur ha the advantag of be abl to maintain rigid despit the adopt of materi less rigid than steel such as aluminum alloi and resin for the outer and inner panel anoth import advantag of the space frame structur is that it enabl the us of compar cheaper extrud materi for the frame structur compon extrud materi can be made with heavier gaug for us in spot that requir high rigid or thei can be made with thinner gaug for us in spot that requir low rigid furthermor even if section with insuffici rigid happen to be construct in a space frame structur made of extrud frame the weak can easili be compens for with stiffen rib for the space frame structur of the asf car exhibit at the show the lowest cost extrud materi wa us in the largest quantiti the next lowest cost die cast materi wa us in the next to largest quantiti and the highest cost roll

leagu basebal regular season game telecast on network televis have drop to 16 for the come year everyth els is go to be on pai cabl that will virtual elimin access to live basebal for vast segment of the popul includ those segment that have provid tremend player personnel resourc the rural poor white kid and the inner citi black kid the futur rickei henderson the frank robinson the vada pinson ar not go to have access the time is long past when kid could go peer through a knothol in the fenc and watch their hero elimin that access is eventu go to hurt basebal becaus these ar the athlet of the

to be veri difficult to ignor thi mean ten of million of new fan open a tremend market for sport paraphernalia right now if you look at the nba africa is repres russia is repres czechoslovakia is repres yugoslavia is repres grow internation could erod the tradit of american sport and the involv of the typic american fan who find sport hero appeal becaus thei can identifi with them now thei ve
