poor job of monitor to be sure but it is not suspect that space also must be brought into order meanwhil the accumul of space debri hide a danger which is in no wai less danger than that from the ozon hole thi wa told to me by lidiya rykhlova a depart head at the astronom institut russian academi of scienc too frequent peopl concentr on the lesser evil not see that right here alongsid a differ and greater misfortun is take shape for exampl how mani now speak of the meteorit danger for cosmonaut but now the american have carri out the follow experi on a return satellit thei count the number of impact from bodi of cosmic and artifici origin there were far more of the latter scientist assert the total mass of natur bodi in near space now doe not exce 200 kg and that thei and we have litter there about 3 million kilogram so in actual ar cosmonaut threaten the first task of the new world space servic is to monitor the unplan fall of artifici space object but there also ar other case the object do not fall to the surfac but without warn explod in space and thi mai caus a precipit increas in fragment on the fall domino principl for exampl our proton booster is on of the most reliabl in the world for thi booster virtual all the shot into orbit have been without a miss but now it ha been clarifi at the confer on space debri the last stage of the proton when after it ha put a satellit into orbit continu to dangl in space and after sever year mai explod six such case were discov if it is taken into account that there alreadi have been about 200 proton launch and 6 7 ar still be plan annual you can visual how these cleanest rocket will increas the danger now through the joint effort of our and american specialist the reason for the explos seemingli have been clarifi and will be elimin but in ani case there also is on more common reason attent ha been concentr on current launch and what will happen there after five year with the spent part give no on concern in thi connect the problem acut aris of stationari satellit in particular meteorolog commun satellit these ar vehicl which ar launch to such an altitud that at all time thei hover over the veri same point on the earth revolv togeth with it with the same angular veloc sinc the orbit of these satellit is uniqu and individu a small window ha been alloc to each countri with an admiss deviat from it of onli 74 km upon exhaust it us life the satellit remain in thi small window it would be good to have it remov from there in order not to hinder new launch but thi will cost as much as it oper for a month when the dilemma aris of remov a satellit from orbit a month befor exhaust of it us life or receiv valuabl inform for a month more the latter choic is usual made but inde ever newer satellit ar be launch there true there alreadi have been preced for more long rang solut alreadi in 1979 the soviet union remov the first such satellit from orbit some other countri took the same step but in most case stationari satellit remain in their orbit concentr into veri small space cluster visual that in thi dens cluster of satellit there is an unplan explos of a spent vehicl inde alreadi about 4500 satellit of differ countri have accumul in thi orbit incident there have alreadi been such explos but up to thi time we do not know how mani fragment thei have gener observ from the surfac make it possibl to see onli fragment which ar larger than a meter it is clear that observ method and instrument must be improv but someth els also is clear there must be strict intern law restrict and prevent space contamin in thi respect regul both the launch of vehicl and their return to the earth how to contend with space debri it is possibl to find a tradit wai by strengthen the skin of ship their resist to meteorit and the fragment of man made vehicl but it also is possibl to decreas the number of launch without therebi reduc the amount of equip put into orbit inde the princip compon of space debri is cast off rocket stage and the common task of all the space power is clean up their technolog in order that it be accompani by the fewest part so that fewer of them will be dump in space unfortun for the time be there ar no impress project for the cleanup of space anywher in the world perhap thi is in the imagin of scienc fiction writer mankind as befor live in thi respect in accord with the russian proverb as long as the thunder doe not burst forth the peasant doe not cross himself but the time for cross oneself ha long pass for exampl orbit the earth at a rel low altitud there ar 54 satellit with radioact energi sourc aboard in principl it is assum that when their activ exist ceas there will be suffici time for the nuclear fuel to deactiv to a safe level but inde here also there were unpredict unmonitor accid misfortun could be prevent through the common effort of differ countri incident the last such case becam the direct reason for the first meet of space cleaner in germani at darmstadt in 1992 the second confer of the intern coordin committe on space debri wa held recent in moscow absolut new busi and for the time be four organ ar particip in it the russian european and japanes space agenc and nasa work group on observ measur compil of catalogu research on the environment impact on test and protect and on reduc contamin ar alreadi in oper in short the reduct of space

theori that the familiar object seen by astronom galaxi star planet quasar interstellar dust cloud and so on make up less than 10 per cent and perhap as littl as 1 per cent of all materi in the

there enough matter for graviti to stop the univers expand and to draw everyth togeth again in a big crunch ten of billion of year from now or will the univers continu fly apart for ever as the star gradual burn out and everyth spread out into an infinit cold the first reaction of some scientist to the cobe result wa that thei support the idea of a close univers which would pull itself back

research he ha conduct with hi graduat student changbom park show that graviti act on veri slight fluctuat in the distribut of matter a fraction of a second after the big bang would account for the

also remain a littl skeptic but believ the great mysteri mai well be much closer to be resolv it the princeton work should be treat as preliminari becaus nobodi els ha done a simul thi larg bertsching said but it s interest work and it suggest that graviti is capabl of make more complic structur than we had thought gott insist that hi find also fit nice with the first result from the cosmic background explor cobe a spacecraft launch in novemb to studi the background radiat left over from the big bang on of the thing cobe is look for is evid of cataclysm event like energi releas explos that could have swept particl from the big bang into tighter format lead eventu to the format of such thing as galaxi the first result from cobe releas in mid januari show no trace of such event and that ha puzzl scientist who had expect cobe to find some evid of extraordinari event in the background radiat left over from the big bang i m complet mystifi by how the present dai structur ha come to

have been some kind of energi releas after the big bang but there isn t anyth there that wasn t necessari gott said thi week becaus hi research show that graviti alon could have led to the format of structur like the great wall i wa not at all surpris by cobe he said it is just what i would have expect gott s research is base on the assumpt that even in the earliest univers there would have been some slight fluctuat in the concentr of matter at least on part in everi 200 000 should have been a littl differ he said these fluctuat led to densiti fluctuat that can start to grow and thei keep grow becaus some area would have slightli higher mass and thu stronger gravit pull than other gott said gott and park us the princeton comput to simul what would have happen if the earliest univers had had even slight fluctuat in densiti the comput wa told to simul the effect of graviti on 4 million particl over a slice of the univers 2 billion light year across the data includ slight fluctuat

theoret ag of todai s univers the comput wa spit out imag that gott sai look astonishingli like the observ of geller and huchra while the princeton find ar not as exot as some theori offer by other

great burst when star explod or collid it wa in fact just such an explos that brought sever dozen expert to lo angel last week for a symposium host by ucla discov supernova two year ago an explod star call a supernova wa discov in the southern sky and it wa the brightest supernova seen in 400 year accord to histor record the discoveri sent astronom around the world scrambl for their instrument to wit on of natur s most spectacular show and it ha spawn sever major new area of research becaus a supernova is on of natur s rarest laboratori offer a view deep into the heart of the physic of the univers scientist who have studi the supernova have found that most of their earlier theori have stood the test well just as the theori suggest the supernova ha demonstr that explod star produc the heavi element that make up so much of the univers more recent scientist have discov what thei had expect to find at the center of the supernova a spin neutron star call a pulsar that send off energi like a spin lighthous but no on expect the pulsar to be spin as rapidli as it appar is 2 000 time a second that rapid spin rate is on of the bigger surpris in supernova 1987a which is in a nearbi galaxi call the larg magellan cloud about 170 000 light year awai equal import howev wa the discoveri that the supernova wa send out neutrino in all 20 neutrino were detect in two larg detector on in japan and the other in ohio that alon wa consid a signific achiev sinc neutrino do not have an electr charg and thu ar extrem difficult to captur trillion of them ar constantli pass through the earth without ever touch anyth but occasion on collid with an atom in a neutrino detector and the debri from that collis tell scientist someth but not much about neutrino not enough data so while the detect of neutrino from supernova 1987a wa somewhat of a triumph the data gain wa not adequ to determin whether neutrino have enough mass to be signific in the cosmolog question concern the fate of the univers and that set ucla cline to think cline who teach both physic and astronomi decid that if he could get the graviti wave physicist work with the neutrino astronom thei might collect solv on of the great problem of modern astronomi the wai to determin whether a neutrino ha ani mass is to figur out the speed at which it travel if it ha no mass it would be a packet of pure energi travel at the speed of light even a slight mass would slow it a littl for supernova 1987a scientist tri to determin the speed of the neutrino on the basi of the time of the sight of the explos sinc thei arriv at earth at virtual the same time as the visibl light the 20 detect neutrino did not have enough mass to be signific but all 20 of those were of on type call electron neutrino there ar two other type call the muon and tau neutrino which ar stronger candid for have signific mass and which were not detect from supernova 1987a new detector plan more sensit detector ar plan for the year ahead but even if muon and tau neutrino can be detect there remain the problem of determin how long it took them to get here and that brought the graviti physicist and the neutrino astronom togeth last week for the ucla confer a number of major graviti wave detector ar be plan around the world includ a 100 million joint project by caltech and mit that the nation scienc foundat is expect to financ the new detector should be sensit enough to detect graviti wave creat by a supernova in hi gener theori of rel albert einstein postul that some event such as collid or explod star would send out burst of radiat in the form of graviti wave that concept ha becom gener accept among physicist although no on ha been abl to prove it the hope is that the next gener of graviti detector especi the on plan by caltech and mit will be sensit enough to detect them sinc graviti wave travel at the speed of light the differ between the time that graviti wave ar detect and the time that neutrino ar detect would offer a precis wai of determin the mass of all three type of neutrino network of detector cline and the other scientist who were at the ucla symposium ar try to establish a framework for graviti wave detector scatter around the world to work in concert with the equal scatter neutrino detector we need to do it now said stanford univers physic professor william fairbank thi could becom a veri excit program the neutrino detector could be put on alert as soon as the graviti wave detector report their first hit that would ensur that all the data from that period would be preserv for futur studi if the neutrino arriv simultan with the graviti wave as mani scientist expect that will rule them out as candid for the miss mass and scientist can start look for someth els if thei arriv sometim later and that could even be a year later if the supernova is far enough awai it will mean that these tini illus element will have the last word on the futur of the univers

some where out there trillion of mile awai the grandest trophi of all await discoveri that trophi is a simpl answer to the most haunt question of all ar we alon the quest for an answer ha prove nearli as frustrat as it is import becaus the distanc between star is so vast that it ha been imposs to prove whether other star even have planet and thu could support life but todai scientist see themselv on the brink of discov whether planetari system ar rare or common throughout the univers the technolog is now at hand to search for planetari system said david black director of the lunar and planetari institut in houston we ar wit the birth of a new disciplin that technolog will includ a wide rang of orbit telescop that will have to function on a level of perfect almost beyond imagin it will take year and possibl decad to design build and put the telescop in orbit but scientist believ thei ar readi to begin answer a question that ha bedevil human sinc the dawn of histori the search is hamper by the fact that there is onli on known planetari system throughout the entir univers we onli have on we can studi and that is our own peter goldreich of caltech told a planetari seminar at uc berkelei mark the 100th birthdai of the astronom societi of the pacif but becaus the solar system form about 4 5 billion year ago there is littl evid remain that ha not been sever alter by the passag of time all the clue we have ar veri old goldreich said what happen all those mani year ago to caus nine planet to form around a young undistinguish star while scientist disagre on the detail there is a consensu on how it all began expert believ that in it prenat stage the sun wa a giant cloud of ga and dust call a solar nebula drift through the galaxi like cloud in the earth s atmospher some area were more dens than other and thei gradual accumul enough materi to creat weak gravit field as the denser pocket grew in mass thei swirl around each other and ultim merg caus the core of the cloud to grow ever more compact in time the inner core of the cloud collaps from the increasingli strong gravit field caus an implos that set off a nuclear chain reaction it wa a spectacular but not unusu event repeat billion of time throughout the milki wai galaxi anoth star had been born a star destin to becom a modest averag perform like trillion and trillion of other after it birth the sun remain cloak in a cloud of ga and dust for awhil but the new star gener power forc includ an immens magnet field and fierc solar wind that soon began sweep the cloud awai from the sun s pole and into a flat disk that swirl around it equat the dust and ga then coalesc into planet in recent year space born observatori and advanc in the sensit of ground base telescop have found evid that disk routin form around young star but thei do not last veri long richard terril of the jet propuls laboratori and brad smith of the univers of arizona captur a dramat photograph of a star known as beta pictori show a band of infrar radiat around it central core indic the presenc of a disk astronom steven beckwith of cornel univers and anneila sargent of caltech took that on step further and discov sever young star with disk but their evid suggest that a disk last onli through a star s infanc other find support that the husband and wife team of steve and karen strom of the univers of massachusett found that 60 of the star thei look at show sign of a disk but as thei ag star lose the infrar signatur steve strom said the disk disappear by the time a star is onli about 3 million to 10 million year old that leav astronom with the predica of have evid that disk ar a common part of star format but with real difficulti in show how a system like the sun s should be abl to form befor the star blow the ga and dust awai the question is can you form planet befor the solar nebula goe awai ask astronom peter bodenheim of lick observatori doe that suggest that our solar system is possibl uniqu an aberr in the star format process probabl not most expert believ we expect to find that planetari system occur rather frequent in natur black of the lunar and planetari institut said that optim is support by a team of canadian astronom who announc two year ago that thei had detect evid of planet orbit around at least two nearbi star the star ar so bright and the planet so dim that it is not possibl to see them but astronom bruce campbel who led the canadian team insist thei ar there planet would not simpli travel in perfect circl around a stationari star instead the entir system would orbit around a point at the center of the system s mass that would caus the star to wobbl slightli campbel said sometim the star would appear to be move slightli closer to a distant observ and at other time it would appear to be reced but sinc the star is so much more massiv than the planet the point around which everyth rotat would still be within the star just slightli off center that in turn make detect a formid task scientist ar now propos some extrem sophist telescop in hope of final resolv the issu all of the telescop would have to be place in orbit becaus the measur ar so exact that the earth s atmospher would distort the result physicist eugen levi of the univers of arizona believ it should be possibl to detect planet through a process known as astrometri that involv track star so precis that ani deviat such as that caus by orbit planet could be demonstr a star with planet should travel in small circl that would caus a slight chang in the angl when view from the earth but what a tini chang it would be levi tri to dramat that point in a present dure the berkelei symposium stand behind a lectern levi tap the side of a light on top of the speaker s stand he told hi listen to look at him while sight along the side of the light then he said move in along the light the width of on atom that s right on atom the chang in the angl is compar to what the orbit observatori would have to measur we re talk small here he said furthermor it take year for larg planet to orbit a star so the observatori would have to work flawlessli for 10 to 20 year unattend in space it would be so sensit to movement that even if astronaut could get up to it thei could not touch it so it would not be possibl to go up there and diddl with it from time to time he ad william borucki of nasa am research center in mountain view ha propos a system that could detect planet more quickli but it is at least as demand as levi s borucki said that if a planet orbit anoth star pass between the observ and the star it would block out part of the star s light dure it transit an extrem sensit orbit observatori should be abl to detect that drop in luminos if the planet is in an orbit close to the star borucki s plan would have the advantag of detect earth like planet that might be in the proper orbit to sustain life but the precis demand by such an observatori is mind boggl planet ar small and star ar larg so your signal is not go to be veri strong borucki said but it s within the realm of possibl yet even he admit it would take a real act of courag to sai you ve found a planet jpl terril believ the onli wai peopl ar go to be satisfi that there ar planet out there is if thei can see them that is not possibl with exist technolog becaus planet ar so dim compar to star that it would be compar to see a light match in front of a glare searchlight a planet the size of jupit would be about on billion time fainter than it star terril said nonetheless terril is work on a nasa propos to develop a telescop that would block out the light of the star and still be sensit enough to see the planet the telescop would need a five foot mirror free of microscop imperfect and it would have to remain so even after be launch into orbit no on ha ever built such a perfect mirror but terril is work with the peopl who fabric the optic for the hubbl space telescop and he believ it mai be possibl mani astronom ar eager to see devic such as these made avail becaus thei ar convinc that planetari system abound throughout the univers all of that ga and dust surround newborn star end up someplac and thei see no reason why the sun s planetari system should be uniqu but a few suggest that in mani case stellar disk form someth els entir the dread brown dwarf it is possibl that the ga and dust left over after star format simpli form anoth star mani theorist have argu but there isn t enough of it for the star to get massiv enough to ignit if so there could be trillion of brown dwarf in the galaxi small star that ar too dim to be seen it would greatli diminish the number of planetari system and thu the chanc of intellig life elsewher if mani stellar disk accret into brown dwarf instead of planet mani scientist howev see no reason to think the earth is unusu we haven t found ani reason to think that a planetari system is uniqu or a miracul thing said alan boss of the carnegi

LA120890-0048: evid of black hole discov by juri rig shuttl telescop space ground control bypass fail comput on orbit columbia crew give lesson to student via televis link scientist on fridai bypass two faulti comput aboard the space shuttl columbia that had jeopard a histor astronomi mission thei also report major discoveri includ stun evid that black hole lurk at the heart of activ galaxi the failur of a second comput thursdai left the crew unabl to control telescop aboard the shuttl and scientist fear thei were not go to get the result thei had hope for from the long await astro astronomi mission but emploi somewhat crude techniqu sever hundr peopl on the ground in texa and alabama team up with orbit astronom to turn the tide in favor of scienc the telescop ar now be guid from the ground and then fine tune by the astronaut and elat scientist said fridai that thei were get better data than thei had dream possibl just hour earlier i didn t want to go in thi morn said astronom morton robert but when i got there everybodi wa ecstat the new process take more time than the automat comput driven system that wa suppos to point the telescop and keep them lock on the target so scientist will not be abl to look at as mani object as thei had hope but thei will look intens at the thing thei do focu on both comput shut down after thei overh leav the crew with no wai to give the telescop the precis command need to point them at the right target so that function wa taken over by mission control at the marshal space flight center here then the astronom aboard the shuttl us a joi stick which resembl a control panel for a video game to nudg the telescop into exactli the right posit and keep them lock on target no on wa sure it would work but by most measur it did so quit well the astronaut took time out from their work fridai to final realiz the late christa mcauliff s dream teach a lesson from orbit explain the wonder of astronomi and urg schoolchildren to studi math and scienc the lesson from space were beam down to televis in classroom across the nation in a project to show student how astronaut live and work in orbit and to describ the valu of studi the entir electromagnet spectrum to learn more about the structur and evolut of the cosmo i m talk to you from the space shuttl columbia orbit 200 mile abov the surfac of the earth astronom samuel durranc said as he began the space lesson from columbia i d like to talk to you todai about space astronomi and the electromagnet spectrum in addit select group of seventh and eighth grader were gather at the marshal space flight center here and the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md to observ the lesson by us satellit dish student across the nation were abl to watch the lesson live in their classroom in an unpreced effort to highlight scienc educ the 20 minut lesson entitl space classroom assign the star wa taught by durranc and astronaut jeffrei hoffman who took their student on a brief tour of the shuttl question from the student were answer by astronaut robert parker and astronom ronald paris if you ar interest in thi sort of work and would like to learn someth about it yourself and perhap particip in the space ag in the futur my recommend for all of you student listen is to continu to studi hard read a lot about astronomi and space and mayb you can help answer some of these question that we ve been talk about hoffman said fridai s space lesson took place nearli five year after the jan 28 1986 explos of the shuttl challeng that kill all seven aboard includ mcauliff a new hampshir schoolteach willi carter an eighth grader from memphi tenn said the countri is sort of regain from the challeng explos thi ha probabl put more hope in all of us i feel better now that we ve got someth go compar to the explos the astro observatori aboard the columbia consist of four telescop that studi ultraviolet light and x rai which cannot penetr earth s atmospher the four telescop each with differ strength allow scientist to studi object simultan but in differ wai meanwhil other team ar studi the same object from ground base observatori all that data will eventu be compil give scientist a more comprehens view of the univers two of the telescop found strong evid that mysteri object known as black hole do exist although no on will ever be abl to see them theorist have long held that black hole power galaxi that emit copiou amount of radiat so call activ galaxi and there ha been some evid to support that black hole ar thought to be so dens that a spoon would weigh as much as earth and their graviti is so great that even light cannot escap a black hole should have a power impact on it neighbor rip nearbi star apart and pull in the debri like a giant whirlpool in space scientist ar concentr on find featur in the disk of materi swirl around object believ to be black hole the disk should emit such thing as x rai creat in the violent destruct of materi as it is swept toward the black hole astro s broad band x rai telescop wa train on on galaxi call markarian 335 that is thought to be harbor a black hole the result said astronom peter serlemitso the instrument s princip investig tell us that inde there ar like to be giant black hole becaus the sensit instrument found exactli what theorist had predict it would find if the galaxi ha a black hole at it center thi telescop doe not produc pictur instead it produc a spectrum that show the characterist of the light emit by the target light for exampl disclos the chemic present when the light wa produc the x rai telescop also measur the level at which x rai ar be produc by the target and accord to theori that level should rise enorm near a black hole becaus more materi is be rip apart in the violent process and in a dramat announc fridai serlemitso said the data collect by hi instrument amount to undisput evid that thi upturn doe inde take place farther out from the region where the x rai ar be produc the swirl ga and dust around a black hole should emit ultraviolet light and anoth instrument aboard columbia the hopkin ultraviolet telescop found that to be the case he see the hottest stuff said arthur f davidsen princip investig on the hopkin telescop refer to the region that produc serlemitso x rai i see the stuff that s on it wai davidsen said data collect by hi telescop fit nice with the x rai evid with on pick up where the other leav off we re go to pull them togeth and bingo davidsen said will that prove that black hole exist i doubt that anybodi will ever come up with absolut proof serlemitso said instead you will have an accumul of evid that is veri convinc so although nobodi will ever see a black hole two telescop aboard columbia search a closer part of the neighborhood than anyon ha been abl to visit befor davidsen stop short of claim total success for hi own experi but he said of serlemitso hi data look fantast to me
