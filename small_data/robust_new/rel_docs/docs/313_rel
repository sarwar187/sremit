the speed most of the run resist in the high speed rang is occupi by aerodynam drag as we move toward faster speed in the futur how to decreas the run resist that is aerodynam drag becom a problem therefor us the front shape with the least aerodynam drag and reduc the cross section area of the car ar requir but thi come with the drawback of less comfort for the passeng in car with small cross section area and fewer seat in try to address the desir for faster speed the advantag of faster speed to improv express servic is overcom by the disadvantag of increas energi consumpt caus by the faster speed and decreas live space as a consequ social consensu and market decis by businessmen ar probabl need sinc the ground facil for a maglev railwai us mani driver and control in the primari ground method the car can be much slimmer than convent car consequ the percentag of a car weight occupi by passeng weight name the payload ratio increas occupi car state 20 0 ton empti car state 15 5 ton in a middl car becaus the system wa construct base on the idea that what doe not have to be move is not move it ha the benefit of energi effici when energi effici in the energi kcal per person s weight in kilogram ar compar without regard to speed a domest airport ha a valu of 579 an automobil 527 the tokaido shinkansen 105 while jr maglev s valu is onli 315 magnet there is the impress that a maglev railwai gener strong magnet field that harm the human bodi in fact the effect of the magnet field gener by the superconduct magnet on the passeng and on peopl who live along the track is at the same level as the magnet field thei normal live in mani electr applianc like electr razor hair dryer televis and wash machin that everyon us have magnet field the magnet field of medic treatment pad 1 300 gauss for stiff shoulder or magnet necklac ar also close to the bodi furthermor the whole bodi is expos to a maximum of 20 000 gauss stationari magnet field in magnet reson imag mri equip that is rapidli spread in the medic field to imag tomogram of cours artifici precis devic such as heart pacemak in the bodi and video camera ar sensit to magnet field no safeti standard concern magnet field

the develop of scienc and technolog for the next 10 to 30 year is an import histor task 2 in the past 40 year china s s t activ have made world famou achiev china now ha 10 9 million natur scienc and technolog personnel includ 1 05 million who ar involv in research and develop we have over 5 000 independ research and develop organ and there ar over 7 000 r d organ under the jurisdict of enterpris thei have form a rel complet s t system that ha made sever world recogn major s t achiev china ha reli mainli on it own forc to solv mani import s t problem in econom construct nation defens and social develop thi is particularli true of the past 10 plu year of reform and open up when china ha readjust it s t develop principl and made breakthrough advanc in reform of the s t system organ attack on kei s t problem extend s t achiev spur s t progress in rural area promot develop of high and new tech industri strengthen intern s t cooper and exchang and other area 3 dure the cours of develop s t work for more than 40 year we have accumul rich experi and mani lesson our main experi ar on s t work must adher to leadership of the communist parti and to the socialist road two adher to reform and open up while perfect plan manag we have strengthen the role of market regul acceler the transfer of s t achiev into product and promot the integr of s t with the economi on the basi of independ and make our own decis we have activ absorb advanc experi and s t achiev from foreign countri and acceler the develop of s t in china three under the unifi leadership of the state we have concentr manpow and materi to organ attack on major s t task in nation econom construct and social develop four while foster the backbon role of our special s t staff we have been concern with integr special scientif research work and mass technic innov and integr lead cadr with s t personnel worker and peasant to jointli spur applic of s t achiev and popular of s t knowledg and improv the scientif and cultur qualiti of all nation our main lesson ar on the guid ideolog and actual work in econom and social develop have not alwai put promot of s t progress in an import strateg posit two econom develop lack mechan and intern motiv forc for reli on s t progress s t develop lack vital in orient toward econom construct and larg number of technic achiev cannot be convert into forc of product which ha result in a certain degre of detach of s t from econom and social develop and an inabl to fulli foster the potenti of scienc and technolog third in s t work there is a lack of unifi arrang and a ration divis of labor as well as the univers exist of repeat problem at low level the phenomena of detach from our nation condit blindli push forward and catch up and press urgent for achiev have also occur at time four major error have occur in polici toward intellectu that have damag the initi and creativ of s t personnel and affect the healthi growth of our s t staff a social climat of respect knowledg and respect skill personnel ha not been form 4 s t work must be orient toward modern toward the world and toward the futur todai s new s t revolut that is develop in a burgeon manner in the world ha caus s t to permeat everi realm of human societi in an unpreced wai which ha spur an enorm takeoff of the social forc of product and engend profound chang in the configur of the world the degre to which econom and social develop in each countri is depend on s t progress is increas overlap and intersect of basic research appli research and technolog develop ha appear schedul for convert technic achiev into commod product have continu shorten and the relationship among s t educ and product ar becom closer look toward the world s s t develop over the next 10 to 30 year major breakthrough will happen in sever emerg s t field and new product technolog and new understand of natur phenomena will have profound impact on the develop of human societi the develop of high and new technolog will further transform the face of exist industri and becom a major factor in world econom competit the world s econom develop and s t progress ar now move toward internation and s t competit is increasingli becom a decis factor in intern econom competit at the same time mankind must strengthen intern cooper to solv global problem like popul the environ resourc disast and so on that it face in common no countri can achiev modern in a close state 5 china s s t develop must begin with our nation condit china ha a larg popul a weak foundat and underdevelop social forc of product some 80 percent of our popul live in rural area and we will remain in the initi stage of social for a rather long period of histori into the futur china s econom and social develop is face restrict by our popul resourc environ and other factor our popul ha alreadi surpass 1 1 billion and even if we strictli control it rate of growth it will still grow to 1 5 billion by the 2020 s although china ha rather abund total amount of most resourc thei ar rel insuffici in term of per capita amount of resourc compar to the world averag we have on third the per capita cultiv land area on fourth the freshwat resourc on fifth the afforest area and onli on half the energi resourc environment pollut and ecolog destruct alreadi constitut seriou threat to our econom and social develop for a long time china ha been reli on the consumpt of larg amount of resourc to develop our economi technolog and manag in most industri ar backward the qualiti of product is poor and econom result ar low china is on of the world s nation have the highest amount of energi consum per unit valu of output and social labor product is equival to onli about 5 percent of advanc world level in the final analysi these discrep ar discrep in s t level educ level and manag level if we still lack a sens of crisi and urgenc and do not do everyth we can to catch up the discrep will not shrink and thei mai even expand the object of china s socialist modern and construct will be in danger of fall through and we will not have the place in the world that we should have 6 the kei to modern our nation economi and significantli rais labor product is modern of scienc and technolog we must certainli foster to the greatest possibl extent the role of s t as the first forc of product respect knowledg and skill personnel and more conscious shift econom construct onto the track of reli on s t progress and improv the qualiti of labor thi import decis is an indic of an histor chang in china s s t econom and social develop strategi and is import for achiev our goal of struggl for the remaind of thi centuri and into the next on look toward the futur we must have a sober understand of the seriou situat look more toward the favor factor and confid meet the challeng we now have substanti s t forc that have gain mani success experi even more import is that 10 year of reform and open up have brought vigor and vital to our econom and s t develop if we just conscienti adher to the parti s basic line fulli foster the role of s t as the first forc of product inspir enthusiasm and unit in struggl we can certainli acceler the develop of the social forc of product throw off our poverti and backward and achiev our magnific goal of modern to fulli illustr the superior of the socialist system ii

propel by magnet field it ha no wheel and rather than run on convent railwai track it clutch a concret runwai rather like the runner on a curtain rail the technolog date from the 1920s when hermann kemper an electron engin who ran a meat pack busi near the present 32km test site in emsland began pore over paper about the theori of magnet levit kemper develop a model in hi cellar where object were fire along runwai by pass main electr through electromagnet mount on the object and on the runwai in 1934 he regist hi patent and tri unsuccessfulli to persuad siemen the electron compani to take

have the sort of high tech electron which exist todai he sai in hi offic in munich now that larg amount of electr can be pass around a grid and engin can regul the 10mm gap between the runwai and the

levit work by us the repel forc of superconduct magnet of opposit polar in the transrapid propuls come from the forc of magnet attract by pass electr current through a stator pack the stationari part of an electr motor which is laid out on the undersid of a concret runwai a wander magnet field is creat thi magnet field call wander becaus it move down the runwai is attract or excit by levit magnet mount on the undersid of the transrapid so propel the vehicl forward the transrapid pick up speed proport to the increas in electr current the opposit happen when the frequenc is reduc if there is a power failur batteri on board the transrapid ar us to power the eddi current brake system and to guid the vehicl to an emerg stop on the runwai the vehicl glide about 10mm abov the concret runwai a

pull the transrapid raschbichl head a team of engin at thyssen henschel which ran the transrapid 07 the seventh prototyp up to a maximum speed of 450kph last year thei ar now put it through 500 000km of test befor it can be licens to oper test have shown that the vehicl us less energi and is quieter than the french tgv train a grand vitess or the german interc express ic the two high speed train

about 100 decibel for a tgv travel at the same speed becaus the transrapid glide abov a concret runwai it doe not need to overcom the resist between track and wheel which tradit railwai technolog still ha to grappl with that mean accord to thyssen henschel that the transrapid us around 30 per cent less energi than a high speed train travel at the same speed the govern hope that by 2004 a runwai similar to the present test track will be built and that more than 14m passeng a year will be hurtl between germani s two biggest citi a journei that now take more than three hour by train will take just 55 minut by transrapid the dm5 6bn pound 2 3bn need to financ the runwai and infrastructur will be put up by the feder govern and thyssen ha creat a compani togeth with lufthansa the nation airlin and deutsch bahn the state railwai which have to find dm4 8bn to oper the servic the japanes ar work on similar technolog but opt in the earli 1970s for an electrodynam levit system where magnet repel rather than attract each other the differ system also creat a 10cm gap rather than 10mm between the vehicl and the runwai which the japanes sai is better suit to deal with earthquak risk the transrapid technolog creat magnet field of about 40 amp no bigger than those creat by an electr razor while the japanes have to grappl with big magnet field of up to 700 000 amp about four time as much electr is need to control the movement of the japanes train across such big magnet field and thyssen sai thei ar so power it is thought peopl wear pacemak will not be abl to us the train
