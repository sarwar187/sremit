politician deputi and journalist have fail to attack our nuclear scientist and defens industri offici you activ favor the conserv and develop of the militari industri complex nuclear power and nuclear weapon doe it not seem to you that todai thi is a voic cry in the desert mikhaylov no todai a chang is take place in russian public awar final it is becom clear to the major that in a chang world russia can be preserv onli as a state with progress technolog with a power industri and modern weapon the major of high technolog have been develop and continu to be develop at the scientif center of the ministri of atom energi and the state committe for the defens industri why kill the goos that lai the golden egg we have had enough revolut and it is veri import todai to preserv what ha alreadi been achiev in the economi and in the militari sphere khokhlov but should we continu to produc nuclear weapon of which russia alreadi ha enough to destroi the world sever time over mikhaylov no on intend to destroi it on the contrari by the year 2003 russia s nuclear arsen will have been reduc tenfold we will have 3 500 nuclear warhead left highli effect warhead capabl of defend the countri reliabl against ani encroach i have believ and continu to believ that nuclear weapon remain the onli mean of maintain global stabil on earth ye there is an altern complet trust in the world but is that feasibl now i doubt it the postwar world wa held up on fear of the us of nuclear weapon that is bad but would it realli have been better for world war iii to break out the ussr ha now disintegr there is no longer a warsaw pact the berlin wall ha been dismantl for souvenir ha the world becom more peac no ala it ha not todai the new militari polit map of the 21st centuri world ha start to take

countri and i do not want to see my motherland a raw materi tributari in the next centuri that is my hawk s song khokhlov then you probabl do not greatli welcom the russian us accord on the broad scale reduct of nuclear arsen mikhaylov we saw long ago that there ar too mani weapon thei must be reduc but we must have a realist approach toward the pace of disarma the dismantl of on nuclear warhead cost 100 000 and no on abroad will help us here thei do not have the technic and financi potenti thei do not have the technolog and what politician will allow foreign warhead to be brought into hi countri and dismantl todai russia is spend up to 1 000 billion rubl r a year on the dismantl of the nuclear warhead to be reduc develop the scale of thi undoubtedli necessari busi is an extrem difficult problem we need invest enorm invest and there can be no talk here of ani profit allegedli extract by russia the agreement with the unit state on the process of weapon grade uranium over the cours of 20 year for us as fuel for nuclear electr power station is onli partial compens for the expens we have alreadi incur by destroi the warhead of ukrain belorussia belaru and kazakhstan as a whole there is still food for thought for the politician and economist of the whole world khokhlov previous everyth connect with nuclear problem wa strictli secret is the ministri of atom energi s iron curtain be open todai mikhaylov we ar simpli doom to cooper with the scientist of other countri russia ha activ join in work to creat intern cooper in the field of scientif research and the dissemin of new technolog we have also start to us foreign invest a number of develop in the ministri of atom energi s scientif research institut and enterpris ar financ by foreign and the result ar be us jointli in 1993 we attract about 80 million by thi mean for addit financ for scientif and technolog develop khokhlov will thi open not lead to the leakag of secret inform mikhaylov we show onli what we want to show khokhlov and no on tri to take a peek at anyth or to bribe our scientist go abroad mikhaylov i am not involv with spi but compet organ assur me that there ar no spi in the ministri of atom energi system with an increas in the exchang of specialist there ha inde been an increas in the relev organ intellig interest in them but i think it is not yet known who can spy more on whom inde it is not my sphere of activ khokhlov not so long ago there wa a noisi stori about the attempt by a group of our nuclear scientist to leav for north korea mikhaylov thei did not includ a singl nuclear scientist anoth case of misinform there is not a singl nuclear physicist from the weapon complex who would flee or try to flee russia as far as i know specialist in the develop of carrier that is rocket specialist intend to go to north korea khokhlov the american have now taken up north korea veri serious in your view is it a case here of polit or ha the asian state inde becom the possessor of nuclear weapon mikhaylov the nonprolifer of nuclear weapon is a veri sensit question a larg group of state is seek to creat nuclear weapon or alreadi ha them on can sai quit confid that india ha nuclear weapon it ha carri out two warhead test the republ of south africa ha admit that it ha militari atom energi pakistan iraq israel and a number of other countri deni thei have such weapon but ar activ involv in creat them the technolog and scientif potenti of mani state now enabl them to design and produc primit nuclear devic which could be us for militari purpos khokhlov what is primit for you for instanc the kind of devic which the unit state us in 1945 to destroi hiroshima and nagasaki mikhaylov perhap these devic ar even simpler as for north korea i doubt that it could creat nuclear warhead in the veri near futur it scientif potenti is not high and it technolog ar far from progress perhap there is the accumul of certain quantiti of uranium khokhlov bought from us mikhaylov includ some bought from us but let us treat thi as calmli as possibl without strew our head with ash as is customari now for instanc we have sold noth to pakistan but that ha not prevent it from develop it own militari nuclear program incident west european compani which sold dual purpos technolog and output help iraq veri consider in it nuclear develop i state absolut categor that among the develop state russia ha the smallest contribut to the prolifer of nuclear technolog across the planet khokhlov viktor nikitovich let us turn from the militari atom to the peac atom although sinc chernobyl that term sound ambival mikhaylov new technolog alwai involv risk the chernobyl tragedi taught us a lot question of the safe oper of nuclear electr power station ar a prioriti now but howev unpleas it is to rememb chernobyl the us of nuclear energi for peac creation is the natur path of mankind s progress the date of 27 june is the jubile of nuclear power engin the world s first nuclear electr power station wa commiss 40 year ago in obninsk todai 17 percent of electr on the planet and 30 percent of electr in europ is gener at nuclear electr power station in our countri the figur is 12 percent but in some countri it is up to 80 percent incident the econom miracl of japan germani and south korea ar the direct consequ of those countri us of the cheap energi from nuclear fission whether there will be a resurrect of russia also depend to a consider degre on our effort todai in the develop of thi type of energi nuclear energi is ecolog clean energi there is no altern the combust of larg quantiti of organ fuel lead to the emerg of the greenhous effect and destroi the planet s ozon layer rapidli develop mankind can retain a sensibl compromis with the environ onli if nuclear energi is develop the main thing of cours is to make it safe khokhlov is someth be done mikhaylov russia is cooper activ with the intern atom energi agenc iaea the safeti of nuclear electr power station is a problem for all mankind and the develop of the scientist of ani countri should serv all peopl most import in world cooper ha been work to increas the safeti of exist first gener russian reactor the unit state britain the frg and japan ar take part in thi work a fundament new approach the station approach ha been agre for technic assist to the safeti of russian nuclear electr power station whose implement ha been initi within the framework of the european union commiss s budget the station approach will be implement directli at the kalinin balakovo kola smolensk leningrad and beloyarsk nuclear electr power station but we nonetheless regard our own develop ar the prioriti on there ar alreadi plan for station with their own natur safeti the product of fission at these station in ani unforeseen situat will be local within the reactor block an uncontrol nuclear fission chain reaction is in principl imposs at nuclear electr power station of the new gener khokhlov incident about nuclear wast recent the green have tri to prevent their import into russia from finland why should our countri becom the world s nuclear garbag heap mikhaylov thi is all idl talk russia is allegedli put a time bomb under itself the soviet union ha construct sever nuclear electr power station abroad and the wast at these station can be store for no more than five year under the term of treati with bulgaria finland hungari and the czech republ russia as the ussr legal heir is continu to import it and process it at enterpris of the ministri of atom energi khokhlov where exactli mikhaylov where the fuel wa produc near krasnoyarsk tomsk and chelyabinsk after special process the nuclear electr power station wast is enclos in glass and store in concret bunker that is absolut safe for peopl and the environ khokhlov a sudden earthquak mikhaylov we do not expect earthquak in the place where nuclear electr power station wast is store for the next millenium in 1 000 year time is some cataclysm were to occur the process nuclear fuel will no longer present a danger new method ar now be develop for destroi nuclear wast it burn in special devic and it us in fast neutron reactor khokhlov but can you explain why then finland is reluct to buri the wast from it lovisa nuclear electr power station somewher in the tundra and is export them to us mikhaylov it doe not have the condit and technolog for process we do and it is econom advantag for russia to accept wast thei pai for it thei pai veri well a fight is now under wai on the nuclear wast market between the unit state franc and britain russia is also take part it mean big monei which we invest in inter alia the improv of the safeti of russian nuclear electr power station incident the finn ar alreadi consid whether to pai us monei or to keep their wast in their own countri khokhlov doe russia bear respons for the safeti of nuclear electr power station in ci and baltic state mikhaylov no sinc the collaps of the ussr these have been domest problem for sovereign state politician treat thi veri zealous but we russian nuclear scientist ar open to cooper with everyon armenia ha decid to resum the oper of it nuclear electr power station we ar help khokhlov on more problem connect with the collaps of the ussr an underground nuclear charg readi for explos remain in kazakhstan what will happen to it mikhaylov we ar prepar to dismantl the drive mechan zabivochnoy ustroystvo and we shall either remov the nuclear devic or destroi it on the spot it is small in term of yield less than on kilotonn it is not a militari charg but a simul anticip a question about the ecolog i shall sai there will be no problem khokhlov on the other hand it seem mani problem ar aris in connect with the rais of the sunken nuclear power submarin komsomolet mikhaylov the din rais over thi submarin in my opinion is in direct proport to the sum which certain group of peopl could obtain for carri out the rais oper there is a veri great deal of specul surround the komsomolet and it nuclear stuf rais a ship from such a depth and under such extrem condit is imposs i said so back in 1992 especi as there is no need there is no leakag of plutonium all the test show that we should leav the komsomolet on the sea bed the ship will disappear into the silt and natur itself will do a better job than peopl of neutral the nuclear weapon in it khokhlov how mani peopl ar now emploi in the russian nuclear weapon complex mikhaylov over 100 000 these peopl ar on of russia s chief resourc unfortun thei ar now have quit a difficult time live and work the total market into which thei have tri to push the nuclear sector the shortag of fund and our utterli primit convers have markedli reduc the return from both scienc and industri the sector s steadi develop can be achiev onli with state econom regul ye we can produc the world s best saucepan which will be competit on market from africa to america but do we realli need to enter the new centuri with saucepan in the veri near futur onli those countri in which high technolog ar develop will be abl to live properli i want russia to be on of them khokhlov in june the russian defens industri intend to go on strike will the nuclear scientist support them mikhaylov we ar forbidden by law to go on strike khokhlov what is the averag wage in the sector now mikhaylov in the industri specialist receiv an averag of r230 000 at a nuclear electr power station thei get r420 000 our scientist ar poorer the averag salari is r150 000 it is true that we have been abl to increas wage at the arzama 16 and chelyabinsk 70 feder nuclear center to r250 000 in 1993 some 6 8 percent of what were not the worst specialist left the ministri of atom energi for commerci structur a piti but it is surpris that given the miserli salari and the paltri grant from the state budget for the develop of scienc and industri given the fact that fix capit is more than 50 percent worn out the ministri of atom energi is work with an except return on mani salient we ar still ahead of the whole planet research and appli work is under wai in the field of nuclear physic high energi and superconduct physic thermonuclear fusion and electron onli patriot can work in these condit if the sector is allow to surviv now it will be of enorm benefit to russia khokhlov viktor nikitovich no on ha yet deni the famou formula if you want peac prepar for war our first atom bomb wa creat by kurchatov our first hydrogen bomb by sakharov and third gener weapon ar our babi is the appear of a new type of weapon in the veri near futur possibl mikhaylov i think so if mankind is unabl to renounc militari atom energi complet then such a weapon could appear by the year 2000 khokhlov how will it differ from exist model mikhaylov the nuclear warhead now avail ar usual call highli effect the new fourth gener will be guid weapon napravlennogo deystviya khokhlov can you predict who the inventor of thi weapon will be russian or us scientist mikhaylov it is hard to sai breakthrough in scienc depend littl on the econom or polit situat in a countri and our scientist brain work no wors than those
