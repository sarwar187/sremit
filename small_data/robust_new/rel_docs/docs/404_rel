thi ha been misrepres first the british govern ha no selfish strateg or econom interest in northern ireland that doesn t mean that we don t care about it nor that we don t share the interest of it peopl in a secur prosper and peac futur it doe mean that we would have no reason to wish to frustrat the democrat express wish of the peopl we shall abid by these wish and if the peopl prefer to remain in the unit kingdom as thei have done so far we shall uphold their right to do so second our primari interest is to see peac stabil and reconcili establish by agreement among all the peopl who

as i said in the declar encourag facilit and enabl the achiev of such agreement we will howev not try to persuad peopl to go for irish uniti it is not the govern s job to tell the irish peopl what thei should think or to dictat to them where their futur should lie but what we do advoc is agreement reach freeli and democrat i do not believ that the irish peopl want the british govern to coerc the greater number in the north into a unit ireland against their will nor doe the taoiseach irish prime minist albert reynold albert reynold ha publicli oppos such coercion he ha said in the joint

the total level of violenc is now higher northern ireland is in a state of incipi civil war the peac process which is suppos to quench the flame is pour petrol on them in it psycholog effect on the two commun in northern ireland the peac process work like thi the two commun ar not in disagr as to their understand of how the peac process is work both side see the british govern as make concess to nationalist out of anxieti to be rid of the problem and in the hope of bui off the ira but their feel about thi ar radic differ nationalist ar encourag and unionist alarm and both the encourag and the alarm have the effect of stimul the extremist in both commun in an interview in boston on mondai 20 june the irish taoiseach prime minist albert reynold announc that he is seek a form of anglo irish cross border author with execut power thi mean that the nationalist demand is be step up from the consult statu accord to dublin in the anglo irish agreement to a share for dublin in the actual govern of northern ireland almost incred thi provoc statement wa made on the same dai that the new had broken of the massacr in loughinisland mr reynold and hi colleagu seem to have no idea of the kind of impact that their word and action ar make insid northern ireland especi in the protest commun and mr major and hi colleagu also seem either not to know or not to care what effect their traffick with dublin is have in the same quarter neither govern appear yet to see the need for much more drastic secur measur appli evenhandedli against both set of paramilitari godfath intern is not rule out but neither is it yet be serious consid mr reynold s appar bid for a share in the govern of northern ireland should not be taken liter i don t believ dublin realli want anyth of the kind to share respons with britain for the govern of northern ireland would be veri oner inde for ani dublin govern it would mean have to carri respons befor the cathol elector of the twenti six counti for the action of secur forc howev compos in northern ireland those action could well be serious inconveni to the cathol popul in northern ireland and therefor unpopular in the republ consult statu is vastli more comfort and it is most improb that mr reynold ha ani real yearn to proce beyond that point i think the real reason for the ostens bid for constitut limit with execut power wa to fend off chang rather than bring it about mr reynold it seem is under pressur from down street to consent to the amend of articl 2 and 3 of the republ s constitut the articl that lai claim by implic to northern ireland as part of the nation territori of the irish state mr reynold doe not want to do thi becaus it would be unpopular with import element in hi own fianna fail parti it might even result in a challeng to hi own leadership of hi parti someth more vivid in hi mind than the dimli conceiv reaction of peopl live in northern ireland and not vote in the republ albert reynold doe not serious propos to put the amend of articl 2 and 3 to a referendum but neither doe he want to irrit the british by a point blank refus so he make a counter proposit which he know the british ar unlik to accept and which if thei did would be even more obnoxi to the unionist than the mere retent of articl 2 and 3 so he make the counter proposit we ll drop articl 2 and 3 if you give us a share in the govern of northern ireland that should hold mr major for the moment mr reynold is primarili concern with the intern polit of hi side of the border the troubl is that the repercuss of that kind of politick on the other side ar becom far more danger than the present dublin govern seem capabl of imagin alreadi the nationalist point score that ha becom intrins to the peac process is cost more and more live insid northern ireland but thing could get far wors and quickli mr reynold mai not be too worri about destabilis northern ireland he mai even be gratifi as a politician by the polit browniepoint hi tactic ar earn him from the most benight of hi own backbench but he should bethink himself that a destabilis northern ireland could speedili destabilis republ too drive a commun n to desper is a danger busi and ulster protest have been driven far down that road further attempt progress down the nationalist agenda could be fatal i don t think john major is like to make much further progress the result of the down street declar have hardli been encourag for him and the parliamentari arithmet is against further concess but a futur labour govern would be under pressur to show itself even nicer to irish nationalist than tori have been in that connect the sort of thing mr reynold wa talk about thi week joint administr could well be attempt if it were it would precipit a revolt among ulster protest british troop would be under fire from both side and british withdraw would follow the consequ would be shatter for the north and the republ in the republ there ar some sign that peopl sens the danger the leader of fine gae john bruton ha been courag warn against the danger of the cours and is begin to attract signific support i am all for opposit in the republ but i live in mortal fear of a

almost everi dai on can see the failur of british polit in ireland and the frustrat experi of divis the divis did not work in germani or anywher els for that matter certainli not here alioth but the unionist major in northern ireland ha conclus proven over the past 100 year that it will defi ani solut it doe not like even through the us of forc do you realli want a unit ireland with 1 million alien rebel adam on must take into account that the unionist have never stood on their own feet but have alwai been depend on the british when thi state wa found it wa not the unionist but the british who found it consequ we republican demand that the unionist stand on their own feet the ireland that we want is not the exclus miniatur state that we have here in the north but a comprehens on in which we will replac the term cathol and protest by gener accept civil right of the island of ireland on the basi of equal thi requir the particip of the unionist alioth in your view what would chang polit and in everydai life if tomorrow the ira were to publicli renounc the us of violenc adam first of all i regard it as most unlik that the ira will do it in a conflict on either beat the other side or reach a negoti settlement the british have admit that thei ar not abl to beat the ira militarili and dure the past 15 year i have said that thi is not a militari problem which is where there cannot be a militari solut but that there ha to be a polit solut last year sinn fein particip in a number of polit initi all of which were aim at a peac agreement a negoti settlement we talk to the british govern there wa the initi between me and mr hume from the social democrat and labour parti sdlp and we met church leader and other opinion leader in all of ireland we reach agreement among northern irish nationalist which wa support by the govern in dublin and of which the ira said that it might be a basi for peac all that led to the down street declar of 15 decemb 1993 which wa describ by the british govern as a first step toward a peac settlement therefor it seem quit unlik to me that the ira and neither the british or the loyalist might take unilater action the inner logic of the situat and the develop of the past 14 month point to a multilater negoti settlement such a solut wa delai and stop in the past three four month and ha to be follow up quickli now thi process will at on point lead to a demilitar that is to sai an end to arm activ from all group involv includ the ira thi would of cours be a major step ahead becaus we would thu be move toward a polit solut alioth in your opinion what ar the polit consequ of the ira kill yet anoth policeman in northern ireland adam meanwhil it sound almost banal like a clich i think that in thi situat ani casualti ha to be regret everi singl casualti victim whether it is a royal ulster constabulari ruc offic a british soldier or as quit recent alleg member of loyalist organ is regrett we need demilitar thi is someth i have alwai work for i have ask all parti involv to lai down their arm the ira the british the loyalist and i have not chang my posit last week we had the death of theresa clinton the wife of a sinn fein member there were a number of attack against cathol and the home of cathol the ira kill a ruc man and most recent the ira kill two peopl claim that thei were loyalist the famili of all these victim will feel exactli the same pain on could sai that theresa clinton had noth to do with all that she wa a woman it wa hard luck that she wa marri to a republican while the ruc man wa a respons arm voluntari member of the british arm forc and so on yet i do not think that such qualif and half justif will bring thing ahead we must make sure that the chanc for peac ar not wast whatev the justif or the circumst of the conflict up to the winter of 1993 mai have been in a situat in which all side claim to have the solut it is disgust that peopl keep get kill alioth did you ever consid that the strategi of the ira and sinn fein of the past 20 year might have been counterproduct that irish uniti wa delai through peopl becom alien with on anoth within northern ireland and the north becom estrang from the south adam it ha not delai unif of ireland which would not even be on the agenda without the fight here in the north yet certain aspect of the ira campaign were certainli counterproduct there can be no doubt and the last let us sai violenc is repuls to the peopl who live in the middl of it here as it is to outsid observ the sooner arm activ ceas the sooner we will enter a nonviol phase of the struggl which will be all the better for all parti involv alioth what to you tell peopl who claim that after 20 year in the polit desert the republican had lost the abil to evalu their oppon polit room to maneuv adam but that is certainli not the case the mere fact that the peac process exist at all and that expect have been so high prove the republican readi for dialogu with their oppon even with their enemi alioth in the last five month you constantli ask the british govern for clarif of the down street declar is thi not simpli a trick to press for a meet

develop then everyth will freez the loyalist will step up their murder campaign the british will intensifi militari occup at easter the ira suspend it activ for a few dai to support a clarif thi wa at a time when the republican were try to be flexibl and facilit demilitar while what we have got is militar then the ira will of cours take action again and we ar find ourselv in the situat in which the

all of us our children our neighbor have the desir to live in rel peac i have live in thi conflict all my life thi is why i think that my long for peac is mayb greater than that of other who do not

carri out these sectarian murder that ar go on what is the justif in anybodi s mind in anybodi s conscienc to go out and shoot in cold blood just becaus thei profess a differ religion to their own no matter which side you come from it must be clear to everybodi that the onli wai ahead for a solut to thi problem is for all parti to get around the tabl we ar proceed with our work behind the scene to have the framework document readi what inde mr maginni and the unionist leadership would do well is to take on their own respons of leadership and to tell their own paramilitari as inde jame molyneaux

of the down street declar that the clarif mai have move that up to 70 30 what do you think is happen reynold i have heard that as well but i have no inform to suggest which is right or which is wrong but on thing is certain from our meet todai that is there is a clear messag gone out that no paramilitari organ is go to bolster or improv their posit by carri on violenc so i m not in a posit to

govern ar not go to wait around wait for paramilitari to make up their mind we ar go ahead with the polit process with the framework for the talk that can allow peopl to come back around the tabl and after all it is the two unionist parti at the moment who have taken a standoff posit in relat to polit dialogu so on the on hand it s a bit disingenu to talk about the two govern should get into the
