vladimir pasechnik wa born in 1937 in stalingrad a citi soon to be ravag by the second world war he becam on of the brightest young scientist in the soviet union determin to us hi talent in the caus of peac never allow hi research in biophys to plai ani part in the kind of destruct that had cost the live of hi famili after graduat he did research at the institut of high molecular compound in leningrad work on new antibiot and treatment for supposedli incur ill such as cancer in 1974 he wa approach by a gener from the soviet ministri of defenc with an irresist offer to set up and run a laboratori in leningrad with an unlimit budget to bui equip in the west and recruit the best staff from all over the soviet union it would be known as the institut of ultra pure biochem prepar for pasechnik it wa an opportun to realis mani of hi most cherish ambit in the fight against ill hi earli research wa promis he felt he could produc a cure to some form of cancer until then he had thought he would never have the resourc to complet hi work now he wa be given the chanc to develop on of the soviet union s most advanc laboratori in biotechnolog he accept the fact that the offer came from the ministri of defenc did not worri him unduli in the soviet union the militari wa the engin of most scientif research it had the cash and the peopl to run it even if a scientif project had a strictli civilian applic the militari wa still in charg it wa the soviet wai from 1974 to 1981 pasechnik built up hi special laboratori scour the countri until he had 400 peopl on hi staff a lavish budget and enough hard currenc to give hi scientist constant access to the latest biotechnolog advanc in the west the laboratori began it work in 1981 over the next two year pasechnik realis the truth far from be the heart of a new civilian research oper he wa at the centr of a vast network of factori and laboratori work on deadli new weapon of war offici we were involv in vaccin develop and in produc prepar for protect crop said pasechnik in fact we were develop method of product and equip for a huge biolog warfar programm to begin with pasechnik had littl idea of the scale of the oper onli later did he discov that as well as hi laboratori in leningrad there were two more in moscow two just outsid it and on in novosibirsk all work on the same project five manufactur plant emploi 15 000 peopl were oper in other part of the countri the oper known as biopreparat had a budget of 200m roubl and ten of million of american dollar a year it wa on of the best kept secret of the cold war it task wa to develop new strain of diseas more power than anyth known to scienc and to produc them in aerosol form the germ also had to be resist to antibiot avail to the nato armi of the west the specif job alloc to pasechnik s laboratori staff wa to make them effect weapon of war thei had to find wai of deliv the germ by artilleri shell bomb or missil to ensur that thei had a long life in the open air and that thei could be dispers over a wide area the breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institut of appli microbiolog at obolensk 60 mile south of moscow there with the help of work done at pasechnik s laboratori scientist develop their first super plagu a new strain of tularaemia a sever infecti bacteri diseas of man and domest anim carri by contact or insect bite it is name after tular california where it wa discov the test on it were suffici encourag for moscow to give permiss for full scale develop and product two year later the scientist at obolensk were ask to develop an even more deadli germ base on pneumon plagu anoth airborn infect pasechnik s job wa to refin the product process to make the oper more effici as a result by 1987 the soviet union had suffici industri capac to manufactur 200 kilo of the super plagu everi week enough to kill up to 500 000 peopl the super plagu germ wa of cours never manufactur on thi scale the germ had a short life and onli enough wa made for test but the biopreparat network stood on standbi readi to begin fullscal product when instruct at a time in the futur that wa design dai x here then wa a programm for produc the most devast genet engin weapon ever seen just wait to be given the go ahead tini quantiti of the russian super plagu could devast ani citi in the west kill million while leav build factori and raw materi intact thei would be the perfect design weapon at the soviet defenc ministri high rank gener were fulli awar of thi biolog capabl and built it into their militari plan known as the weapon of special design thei would be us not onli as a last resort but as support weapon in a convent non nuclear conflict to attack the enemi s troop reserv and hamper hi oper at port and rail centr everi part of thi programm wa in breach of the 1972 biolog and toxin warfar convent an intern agreement which the soviet union had sign it wa also against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been proclaim by mikhail gorbachev for pasechnik the gorbachev era wa a chanc to try to chang the direct of the programm at hi laboratori in late 1985 he pressur senior offici in biopreparat to let him switch some of hi research effort to the civilian purpos for which it had ostens been establish he got nowher i wa told mani time just to get on with my work and stai in my place he said pasechnik did just that by 1988 he had risen to a rank equival to that of major gener and wa in charg of two manufactur plant and three research laboratori two of these were work on biolog weapon the third wa given to him to placat hi desir to do civil work and also as a cover for the biolog warfar research but pasechnik wa increasingli uneasi he had no idea that hi work wa in breach of the 1972 treati he did not know such a treati exist but he felt that the weapon he wa help to develop were an abus of hi scientif skill and demonstr hypocrisi in the russian militari command about the gorbachev revolut abov all he felt passion that genet engin biolog weapon were a crime against human in late 1988 he began to think about defect despit hi long and illustri scientif career pasechnik had never been allow to travel outsid the soviet bloc then in the summer of 1989 biopreparat began negoti with a factori in toulous franc which manufactur equip for chemic laboratori pasechnik volunt to go to finalis the deal as a reward for hi overal perform permiss wa grant he arriv in franc at the begin of octob he had thought carefulli about how to escap the kgb watcher who travel with hi group on morn he telephon the british embassi in pari and in a brief convers with a surpris diplomat announc himself hi posit and hi wish to defect the new of hi offer reach the secret intellig servic si otherwis known as mi6 in london at a critic time for the previou five year si the american cia and a number of nato militari intellig organis had been try to piec togeth the snippet of inform thei had about the soviet biolog warfar programm in mai 1979 american intellig had heard report of an explos at a secret soviet research facil on the outskirt of sverdlovsk 850 mile east of moscow a leak of anthrax had kill up to a hundr peopl an area three mile downwind of the factori had been contamin the russian had tri to contain the damag with a widespread immunis programm but it had prove larg useless throughout the 1980s the leak had been rais by both british and american offici with their soviet counterpart but the offici line remain the same that a hand of peopl had di in the citi after eat contamin meat bought on the black market there wa no biolog weapon programm snippet of inform from sourc in the soviet union suggest otherwis satellit pictur show plant and test site appar configur for the manufactur of biolog weapon the dia the defenc intellig agenc the pentagon s spi estim that the russian had up to eight site for develop and store biolog weapon si larg concur with that view and a seri of report were circul to intellig chief and british minist warn that the soviet biolog programm had not slow down as a result of the gorbachev reform as frequent happen when intellig is fragmentari the politician refus to hear the messag at the time all western govern had been seduc by gorbachev s reform the cold war wa thaw and no prime minist or presid wa prepar to risk a confront with the soviet union that might chang the delic balanc of intern relat at the same time there wa a sens that gorbachev wa an honour man who would not allow anyth as terribl as biolog weapon to be develop while he wa presid the intellig warn were ignor when the si station chief in pari flash the messag to london about the would be defector in toulous it caus consider excit at last here wa proof that would satisfi even the most sceptic politician pasechnik wa driven to pari and caught a british airwai flight to heathrow travel on fals paper suppli by british intellig as hi feet touch british soil pasechnik burst into tear the decis to leav hi countri and hi famili had place a terribl strain on the defector he had convinc himself that the work he had been do wa so terribl that he would probabl face seriou charg and perhap prison in the west it is a measur of hi courag that despit hi fear he step off the plane readi to tell all as soon as he wa settl in a safe hous outsid london he wa reassur that he had found a new home and not a prison cell there wa the normal nervous in si about ani defector wa he a plant all the indic were that he wa bona fide he did not know how to drive a clear sign that he wa a member of the privileg elit in the soviet union the distress he show when he recount the work he wa do wa imposs to fake then there wa hi love of mozart sonata which he would listen to in the even after yet anoth dinner with hi guardian the si debrief were quickli reassur he brought with him a wealth of new inform it wa stun said on of the debrief a whole ministri expos billion of roubl spent a complet organis shown to be a front then there wa the clear involv of gorbachev thi friend of the west it just went on and on to cope with all the inform pasechnik produc si the ministri of defenc and other govern depart set up a special task forc of scientist intellig offic and analyst to assess the intellig and put it into a wider context it wa painstak work but veri fruit as he describ hi entir life educ and work the taskforc understood for the first time the real relationship between the academi of scienc previous consid a pure civilian bodi and the soviet militari as is usual in such case the intellig glean from pasechnik wa share with the cia on both side of the atlant the mosaic of russia s biolog weapon programm wa gradual fill in as the pictur clear so both the cia and si began to brief their respect polit master for the first time the politician were given unambigu report clearli prepar on the basi of inform from a highli place defector to underlin the serious of the problem pasechnik wa brought out to brief senior offici on both side of the atlant the evid wa so compel that even the politician who had no wish to confront gorbachev were left with no choic in april 1990 the british and american govern jointli confront the soviet union with the evid and spell out in detail what thei knew there wa no reaction then in june 1990 presid georg bush and margaret thatcher met separ with gorbachev both rais the question of biolog weapon gorbachev deni all knowledg thatcher who believ she had a special close relationship with the soviet leader told him that unless the programm wa stop the west would go public gorbachev promis that he would look into the matter two month later the soviet foreign minist eduard shevardnadz sent a formal repli rebut the charg by thi time both the cia and si had produc an even more exhaust brief for bush and thatcher have succeed in forc action at the highest level after so mani year of frustrat the intellig commun wa determin to press it case until the russian confess in decemb 1990 the russian issu an invit to washington and london to visit four of the site that had been name a joint anglo american deleg wa dispatch if the trip wa intend to be reassur it had the opposit effect in obolensk the british discov a chamber for test biolog weapon suspend in an aerosol the steel room which wa 50ft squar had post on the floor to which anim could be ti while vent in the ceil allow poison to be sprai into the room the team also discov a chamber us to test deliveri system for biolog weapon at anoth site there wa row after row of ferment us to mass produc hundr of kilo of biolog weapon a chill confirm of everyth pasechnik had reveal nevertheless the russian continu their denial in septemb 1991 a month after the attempt coup john major the new british prime minist met gorbachev in the kremlin publicli the two hour meet wa confin to econom issu but major confront him with the evid of the secret weapon programm again gorbachev deni everyth and move the normal unflapp major to wave an angri finger in the face of the russian leader we ve got the good on you he shout as the intellig commun continu ad to the file the confront with moscow continu through the fall of gorbachev and the rise to power of bori yeltsin on februari 1 1992 bush and yeltsin met for their first summit in advanc of the meet at camp david american diplomat made clear that the biolog weapon programm wa a major stumbl block between the two alli and a gestur by yeltsin in thi area would be seen as a sign of a new era in us russian relat thi time yeltsin came prepar he admit for the first time that there had inde been a secret programm and that he had order it to be shut down but it wa not for anoth month that yeltsin wa told by hi own offici of the full extent of the programm in march the russian militari final came clean thei had secretli develop bomb and missil capabl of carri the super plagu in defianc of intern agreement yeltsin sign a formal decre cancel the programm but the disinform did not stop there as promin russian offici involv in the biopreparat programm set about try to minimis the work thei had been involv in it wa a campaign fill with the kind of li and evas that were suppos to have vanish in the new era of democraci in russia for exampl gener valentin yevstigneyev assur the newspap nezavisimaya gazeta there were not as mani peopl involv as it might seem he maintain that the work of the variou laboratori wa essenti for civilian purpos he also tri to diminish the role of pasechnik reaction like these contribut to grow sceptic in both london and washington that yeltsin s order to dismantl the biopreparat project wa be carri out although the main test site wa report to have been shut down those monitor the project were hardli reassur when it wa announc that the man put in charg of the dismantl of biopreparat would be gener anatolii kuntsevich the architect of the soviet union s chemic weapon programm hi appoint wa seen as a sop to the hardlin in the militari on senior western intellig offici said here wa thi man who had done noth but lie to us for year on chemic weapon and now suddenli we ar suppos to accept that he is willingli go to set about destroi hi life s work we could hardli be expect to take yeltsin s promis at face valu in juli 1992 the british and american govern demand from the russian a list of all their biolog weapon research product and storag site and access to them two month later russia agre to allow a full inspect but fail to admit the exist of all of their site there the matter stand sinc then verif ha prove almost imposs to reinforc western concern the cia brought out a defector from the biopreparat programm in late 1992 he confirm pasechnik s stori and ad to western suspicion that while yeltsin wa claim the programm had stop the research and develop of new strain of genet engin superweapon were continu apac when presid bill clinton and yeltsin met in vancouv less than a year ago biolog warfar wa on the agenda onc again yeltsin assur the american presid that all work had stop thi time yeltsin wa so convinc that even some of the most cynic in the intellig commun were inclin to believ him then last autumn anoth defector from the biopreparat project came over to british intellig to tell hi debrief what step the russian militari had taken to keep the project go in everi facil that had been open for inspect to western intellig the russian had establish convinc cover stori that made it appear as if each site had been convert to research or manufactur of vaccin the secret work continu in part of the site that were never visit by the american or british offici at the same time a secret new facil wa be built at lakhta near st petersburg far from the biopreparat biolog warfar programm be shut down it had undergon consider modernis work is continu as befor in defianc of yeltsin s order if the stori so far ha not had a happi end for britain and america the sourc of the inform that expos the programm ha been more fortunad todai vladimir pasechnik is happili settl in england he ha a job he love work for a british compani do exactli the civilian research he want to do when he graduat for him the disappoint is that hi sacrific in leav the countri he still talk about with a patriot fond ha not stop the programm he still consid to be a seriou threat to human if thi research is allow to continu in defianc of the polit leadership in moscow it make a mockeri of russia s pretens to be a democraci it also rais seriou question about the futur intent of the russian militari who have us polit capit and scarc resourc to continu a programm that remain a

research in biophys to plai ani part in the kind of destruct that had cost the live of hi famili after graduat he did research at the institut of high molecular compound in leningrad work on new antibiot and treatment for supposedli incur ill such as cancer in 1974 he wa approach by a gener from the soviet ministri of defenc with an irresist offer to set up and run a laboratori in leningrad with an unlimit budget to bui equip in the west and recruit the best staff from all over the soviet union it would be known as the institut of ultra pure biochem prepar for pasechnik it wa an opportun to realis mani of hi most cherish ambit in the fight against ill hi earli research wa promis he felt he could produc a cure to some form of cancer until then he had thought he would never have the resourc to complet hi work now he wa be given the chanc to develop on of the soviet union s most advanc laboratori in biotechnolog he accept the fact that the offer came from the ministri of defenc did not worri him unduli in the soviet union the militari wa the engin of most scientif research it had the cash and the peopl to run it even if a scientif project had a strictli civilian applic the militari wa still in charg it wa the soviet wai from 1974 to 1981 pasechnik built up hi special laboratori scour the countri until he had 400 peopl on hi staff a lavish budget and enough hard currenc to give hi scientist constant access to the latest biotechnolog advanc in the west the laboratori began it work in 1981 over the next two year pasechnik realis the truth far from be the heart of a new civilian research oper he wa at the centr of a vast network of factori and laboratori work on deadli new weapon of war offici we were involv in vaccin develop and in produc prepar for protect crop said pasechnik in fact we were develop method of product and equip for a huge biolog warfar programm to begin with pasechnik had littl idea of the scale of the oper onli later did he discov that as well as hi laboratori in leningrad there were two more in moscow two just outsid it and on in novosibirsk all work on the same project five manufactur plant emploi 15 000 peopl were oper in other part of the countri the oper known as biopreparat had a budget of 200m roubl and ten of million of american dollar a year it wa on of the best kept secret of the cold war it task wa to develop new strain of diseas more power than anyth known to scienc and to produc them in aerosol form the germ also had to be resist to antibiot avail to the nato armi of the west the specif job alloc to pasechnik s laboratori staff wa to make them effect weapon of war thei had to find wai of deliv the germ by artilleri shell bomb or missil to ensur that thei had a long life in the open air and that thei could be dispers over a wide area the breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institut of appli microbiolog at obolensk 60 mile south of moscow there with the help of work done at pasechnik s laboratori scientist develop their first super plagu a new strain of tularaemia a sever infecti bacteri diseas of man and domest anim carri by contact or insect bite it is name after tular california where it wa discov the test on it were suffici encourag for moscow to give permiss for full scale develop and product two year later the scientist at obolensk were ask to develop an even more deadli germ base on pneumon plagu anoth airborn infect pasechnik s job wa to refin the product process to make the oper more effici as a result by 1987 the soviet union had suffici industri capac to manufactur 200 kilo of the super plagu everi week enough to kill up to 500 000 peopl the super plagu germ wa of cours never manufactur on thi scale the germ had a short life and onli enough wa made for test but the biopreparat network stood on standbi readi to begin fullscal product when instruct at a time in the futur that wa design dai x here then wa a programm for produc the most devast genet engin weapon ever seen just wait to be given the go ahead tini quantiti of the russian super plagu could devast ani citi in the west kill million while leav build factori and raw materi intact thei would be the perfect design weapon at the soviet defenc ministri high rank gener were fulli awar of thi biolog capabl and built it into their militari plan known as the weapon of special design thei would be us not onli as a last resort but as support weapon in a convent non nuclear conflict to attack the enemi s troop reserv and hamper hi oper at port and rail centr everi part of thi programm wa in breach of the 1972 biolog and toxin warfar convent an intern agreement which the soviet union had sign it wa also against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been proclaim by mikhail gorbachev for pasechnik the gorbachev era wa a chanc to try to chang the direct of the programm at hi laboratori in late 1985 he pressur senior offici in biopreparat to let him switch some of hi research effort to the civilian purpos for which it had ostens been establish he got nowher i wa told mani time just to get on with my work and stai in my place he said pasechnik did just that by 1988 he had risen to a rank equival to that of major gener and wa in charg of two manufactur plant and three research laboratori two of these were work on biolog weapon the third wa given to him to placat hi desir to do civil work and also as a cover for the biolog warfar research but pasechnik wa increasingli uneasi he had no idea that hi work wa in breach of the 1972 treati he did not know such a treati exist but he felt that the weapon he wa help to develop were an abus of hi scientif skill and demonstr hypocrisi in the russian militari command about the gorbachev revolut abov all he felt passion that genet engin biolog weapon were a crime against human in late 1988 he began to think about defect despit hi long and illustri scientif career pasechnik had never been allow to travel outsid the soviet bloc then in the summer of 1989 biopreparat began negoti with a factori in toulous franc which manufactur equip for chemic laboratori pasechnik volunt to go to finalis the deal as a reward for hi overal perform permiss wa grant he arriv in franc at the begin of octob he had thought carefulli about how to escap the kgb watcher who travel with hi group on morn he telephon the british embassi in pari

for the previou five year si the american cia and a number of nato militari intellig organis had been try to piec togeth the snippet of inform thei had about the soviet biolog warfar programm in mai 1979 american intellig had heard report of an explos at a secret soviet research facil on the outskirt of sverdlovsk 850 mile east of moscow a leak of anthrax had kill up to a hundr peopl an area three mile downwind of the factori had been contamin the russian had tri to contain the damag with a widespread immunis programm but it had prove larg useless throughout the 1980 s the leak had been

in the west it is a measur of hi courag that despit hi fear he step off the plane readi to tell all as soon as he wa settl in a safe hous outsid london he wa reassur that he had found a new home and

biolog weapon research product and storag site and access to them two month later russia agre to allow a full inspect but fail to admit the exist of all of their site there the matter stand sinc then verif ha prove almost imposs to reinforc western concern the cia brought out a defector from the biopreparat programm in late 1992 he confirm pasechnik s stori and ad to western suspicion that while yeltsin wa claim the programm had stop the research and develop of new strain of genet engin superweapon were continu apac when presid bill clinton and yeltsin met in vancouv less than a year ago biolog warfar wa on the agenda onc again yeltsin assur the american presid that all work had stop thi time yeltsin wa so convinc that even some of the most cynic in the intellig commun were inclin to

that had been open for inspect to western intellig the russian had establish convinc cover stori that made it appear as if each site had been convert to research or manufactur of vaccin the secret

polit determin in deal with the major world power center to defend a develop project base on nation interest in light of both of these paramet the futur of the latin american countri appear dismal with the except of costa rica which is not repres of latin america cuba is the onli countri that meet these two requisit and therefor the onli on with a good probabl of leav underdevelop behind the real independ of the cuban state requir no further demonstr and of these five technolog of the futur cuba is now on of the world leader with the unit state in the on that is most import biotechnolog and genet engin by the year 2000 thi market will have a volum of 200 billion and cuba will domin a larg part of it the follow report present a summari of numer interview with director of cuban biomed and biotechnolog institut and provid the most extens account that ha yet been publish abroad on the spectacular advanc made by the cuban biotechnolog school thi lack of inform is not due to ani cuban clamp down on the flow of inform but instead to the virtual censorship of report of ani success of the cuban process a censorship that prevail in almost all of the western commun media aid vaccin as in other laboratori all over the world cuba is also do intens work on the scourg of aid that accord to who world health organ estim ha to date afflict 12 million peopl in mani countri it is now on of the lead caus of death in mexico it wa in fourth place in 1991 the cuban biotechnolog school s battl against aid is be wage on three front the develop of a vaccin against the viru the design of accur and inexpens diagnost system for massiv us in blood bank and with the popul and develop medic to treat opportunist infect that is diseas that occur becaus of the aid induc weaken of the immun system the cigb genet engin and biotechnolog center is on of the most import center work to develop an aid vaccin in a 62 000 squar meter facil near havana over 600 scientist most of whom ar young produc 160 differ product 30 of them develop through genet engin it scientif staff ha expertis in all of the modern methodolog necessari includ genet engin molecular biologi and immunolog and advanc biochemistri and it ha the most advanc research and product hardwar in the world as reveal by an inspect tour of it lab and industri facil dr manuel limonta the director of the institut and of it scientif board state cuba will have an aid vaccin by 2000 or earlier he sai thei have a work group that is develop a vaccin against aid us genet engin technolog to prevent the diseas thi is a strong group which ha alreadi been work on thi program for a long period of time and the group ha produc signific result limonta did not describ these signific result but from other sourc we deduc that thei have manag to isol and character the specif viral strain respons for hiv and that thei ar now in the laboratori test phase the cigb director express confid that thei will manag to bring aid under control immunolog and state categor we ar go to develop a vaccin dieterich steffan befor the french or american do limonta i do not know if it will happen befor but i believ it mai be befor 2000 that is my person belief i think it mai be earlier than that or it mai be around that time that is my view of the matter if it were not dr limonta make thi pronounc it might appear somewhat rash but limonta is a heavyweight in thi field and hi person achiev and those of the institut he direct lend author to hi assert in support of thi the director of the cnic nation center for scientif research dr carlo gutierrez sai that limonta and hi team practic live in their lab when thei ar try to solv someth thei ar extraordinarili dedic to the work thei ar do and if thei make such a statement thei ar capabl of do it he recal their achiev with interferon as an exampl when limonta work with a small team of young research propos produc interferon in cuba peopl were talk of a minimum time frame of three to four year thei did it in 42 dai a truli record time as everyon recogn on the lengthi list of the success of the cigb and it director mani achiev in close collabor with other cuban scientif institut there ar nearli 160 differ product that have been develop by the cigb includ about 30 produc through genet engin from start to finish these ar recombin product to convei an idea of what thi mean dr limonta explain that in what is known as the third world cuba is the onli countri that ha develop from start to finish product through the us of genet engin which ar known and regist product and which ar export such product have not been develop in ani of the other countri even in countri that ar much larger than cuba like china or india just in 1993 the us patent and trademark offic in washington regist three patent for the cigb by so do it recogn the origin of the product and that cuba is the onli countri with the technolog and the methodolog to produc them it also recogn that the qualiti of these product meet the food and drug administr standard the most stringent in the world and grant cuba the exclus right to produc and sell these product in us territori for 17 year these product includ a prevent medic for myocardi infarct call estreptoquinasa regist as no 07 703 778 the first vaccin for mening bc develop anywher in the world 07 754 918 and the invertas sucros enzym which convert sugar into fructos for estreptoquinasa cuba with the except of on us firm is the onli countri that ha produc thi medic sai limonta he explain that thi product can dissolv clot in coronari arteri thi medicin is capabl of elimin clot in a high percentag of patient when it is administ immedi after the infarct and it prevent the infarct from progress so it act as a prevent for myocardi infarct the patent registr for thi product ha alreadi been appli for in over 40 countri thei ar go to grant it for we know that we ar the onli on who have develop an origin process to make thi medic get a patent of thi type reflect the high technolog capabl of our institut in thi case the technolog is genet engin studi of the drug produc in the unit state have demonstr that it biolog effect is similar to that of the cuban product howev the cuban medic is much cheaper than the us drug estreptoquinasa wa also develop in record time from the time when the idea wa first conceiv until the product wa regist as a medic onli four year elaps on the averag in cuba product ar develop in less time than in us and japanes compani we have a studi done by us and japanes scientist that sai that we ar 1 3 time more product than thei ar in term of the time requir to complet a product and put it to us while compli with all the legal requir in practic thi higher product coeffici mai mean for exampl that a us or japanes product which requir 10 year for research and product mai be develop in seven year in cuba the explan offer by the cuban scientist for such a surpris phenomenon is complex but thei all agre that the educ and scientif philosophi of the revolut of which these young peopl ar the result is the kei factor anoth spectacular success of the cigb is what is known as nerv growth factor which is still not known elsewher in the world sai limonta becaus nobodi els ha been abl to develop it thi medic a protein is us to regener nervou system damag and it could also be us in a diseas like alzheim s the product ha now enter the industri product phase which will enabl it to be us in clinic trial genet alter anim and plant anoth line of research the cigb is pursu is the genet modif of anim and plant to date thei have produc transgen mice rabbit and fish their goal is now to produc a genet alter cow limonta explain that in these anim a new trait or genet inform is introduc in the fertil ovum which the anim assimil as it own and transmit hereditarili in thi wai genet chang can be produc and new speci can even be creat the specif object is to make mammal milk in thi case cow s milk also produc medic the cow is an excel milk produc laboratori if we can introduc in thi laboratori the intellig enabl it in addit to milk to also produc specif protein then we could have for exampl interferon product in cow it all seem quit simpl we would not need a complex and costli industri interferon product process which requir the us of ferment equip close monitor etc the entir process would be done sole in the anim we would extract the product from the milk and the milk would then be us normal dieterich steffan that sound like scienc fiction limonta ye but it is go to happen i am absolut sure of it we have alreadi done it we have obtain medic in rabbit milk dieterich steffan do intern specialist know thi limonta the on who read intern public do first we did thi with mice to test the methodolog then we us rabbit to improv the methodolog and produc medic that wa again success and now we ar work to produc medic in larger anim in cow we have not done that yet but we ar go to growth hormon manuel limonta also discuss the cigb progress in the control and us of growth hormon we have work on fish and in thi area we realli have on of the most advanc group in the world we introduc the genet inform contain in the growth hormon in fish thi caus the fish to grow veri rapidli thei do not reach a larger size than normal but thei do so more quickli becaus thei incorpor their food better the time save can be half or an even larger percentag compar with the normal growth period the fish in thi case tilapia a carp ar still not reproduc in larg quantiti but the fundament step ha been taken in the field of anim health thei have creat for the first time anywher in the world a vaccin against cattl tick for which the patent is now be regist in brazil argentina mexico and other countri the develop of a vaccin against porcin colibacillosi a diseas whose mortal rate among newborn pig is 100 percent is anoth notabl scientif achiev at the present time a more advanc version of thi vaccin is be develop in the area of plant health the us of biotechnolog ha result in the increas of plant resist to specif pest a transgen tobacco ha been produc which resist the manduca septa moth an insect that destroi the tobacco leaf with thi genet modif the moth is kill without damag the leaf thi is accomplish without alter the plant s characterist a potato that is resist to on of the three type of viru that affect it seed is anoth cigb achiev thei ar now work to develop resist against the other two thei have also produc a genet alter cabbag with a moth resist gene thei have also develop a transgen sugarcan the first time in the world that a genet alter sugarcan ha been develop to have a sugarcan that is more resist to some pest other achiev on of the cigb big achiev is the recombin vaccin against hepat b which is now us in over 20 countri in cuba it is given to all newborn as part of a nationwid program anoth complet new product now regist in cuba and some other countri but which is still not avail on the market is skin growth factor which is us to treat burn some other import product includ human monoclin antibodi for treatment and in the industri area new enzym on of these enzym is invertas sucros which transform sugar into fructos when fructos is us to sweeten or to improv flavor the amount of sugar need is reduc by 20 to 30 percent the method and technolog us for it industri applic ar exclus cuban against aid on the second front against aid it diagnosi cuba ha three differ techniqu the first wa develop by the aid research laboratori the second by the cigb and the third by the cie immunoassai center in discuss the cigb techniqu dr limonta comment that uniqu diagnost method have been develop for exampl we have the aubio system in which a drop of blood deposit on a plastic strip react with a seri of genet engin compon we deposit on the plastic strip structur similar to the protein of the compon of the viru membran plu a gold base dye when the drop of blood come into contact with the plastic strip a chang in color is produc which indic simpli by sight whether the person ha been infect thi system ha also been develop for us in diagnos toxoplasmosi hepat c etc and it us is now be expand to other ill it offer the advantag of not requir special equip to mix the blood and read the result and doe not even requir a technician or electr current as the result is visibl in ordinari natur light a differ method ha been develop by the cie it ha substanti improv the classic method of immunodiagnosi by reduc the amount of the blood sampl and reagent by 10 percent the efficaci of thi diagnost method ultra micro elisa hiv ha been demonstr in mani countri as well as in intern evalu by the aid refer center affili with the world health organ and paho pan american health organ for exampl in brazil canada and also in cuba itself now the cie is market an aid diagnost kit in mani countri which anyon can bui in drugstor the kit contain a paper filter a pipett to extract a blood sampl from the finger and a form the blood sampl is allow to dry on the filter the person select an anonym person code and list it on the form for exampl abc 345 and then send the dri blood sampl to a laboratori an autom reader like the cuban suma read the test and determin with a margin of accuraci of virtual 100 percent whether that person is hiv posit the person later call the laboratori give hi anonym person code and receiv the result with absolut confidenti and privaci thi system is now us in mani countri includ spain where it us ha been approv by the ministri of health and consum affair the market price is on the averag between 20 and 30 percent less than the price of other product and the cie provid technic personnel and technic analyt or instrument assist as need thi is veri conveni sai the cie director of qualiti control dr rene robaina becaus when an institut like a blood bank need assist we ar there we provid complet attent that includ everyth from the lab setup personnel train and later assist anoth advantag of thi person aid diagnosi regist internation under the name of hipertest is that the paper filter contain the blood sampl can be sent by mail or messeng as it is highli stabl onc it is dry it will last for month without the accuraci of the diagnosi be alter the hipertest is not sold in mexico but thi could be done perfectli well we simpli have to find a transfer mechan sai robaina similar for exampl to what we have in the form of joint capit ventur in russia brazil colombia spain china ghana etc the test is produc exclus in the immunoassai center the filter paper which must have an extrem homogen qualiti is import from germani the chemic reagent also come from the world market while the biolog reagent ar mostli produc in cuba the technolog is exclus cuban at the cnic medicin ar be develop against diseas that occur becaus of the weaken of immunolog defens caus by aid we ar work on medic to allevi aid we still cannot cure it sai dr carlo gutierrez but we can try to get rid of the other diseas we know there ar medic that have slightli lengthen the live of patient and we ar try to do that we ar investig the possibl of a combin of those medic and we ar now at a more advanc level than laboratori test from the laboratori we then go to bench test then to the pilot plant and final to the industri plant we ar now at the bench test stage if we can produc thi medic we could extend patient live more vaccin the finlai institut with an area of 23 000 squar meter unequal in latin america and on of the most modern in the world ha 650 employe it develop the world s first vaccin against mening and in 1990 it wa award a gold model by the unit nation world intellectu properti organ for thi achiev thi vaccin wa develop in bare five year the research had to work with live microorgan creat a high risk of infect as there is no other vaccin we took all possibl hygien precaut explain dr concepcion carma director of the institut and coordin of the research group that develop the vaccin but we had to work with larg volum of bacteria we ar talk of kilogram of live bacteria that were grown in larg 300 liter ferment vat and that wa a real risk the first volunt who us the vaccin were the research themselv becaus as a matter of ethic polici we believ that what we could not put in ourselv we could not ask anyon els to try and when we test the vaccin in children we appli the same ethic standard our own children were the first on who us the vaccin onli later did we go to field test explain the doctor thi vaccin is now be us in a number of latin american countri argentina chile colombia etc where mening is preval in brazil over 20 million dose have been administ without ani sever advers reaction be report in the cuban trial the vaccin demonstr an efficaci of 83 to 98 percent anoth import line of research is the anticholera vaccin which ha alreadi undergon laboratori test with import

FBIS4-67744: bfn articl by jame adam the red death subtitl the untold stori of russia s secret biolog weapon describ as exclus extract from the new spi hi forthcom book text vladimir pasechnik wa born in 1937 in stalingrad a citi soon to be ravag by the world war ii he becam on of the brightest young scientist in the soviet union determin to us hi talent in the caus of peac never allow hi research in biophys to plai ani part in the kind of destruct that had cost the live of hi famili after graduat he did research at the institut of high molecular compound in leningrad work on new antibiot and treatment for supposedli incur ill such as cancer in 1974 he wa approach by a gener from the soviet ministri of defenc with an irresist offer to set up and run a laboratori in leningrad with an unlimit budget to bui equip in the west and recruit the best staff from all over the soviet union it would be known as the institut of ultra pure biochem prepar for pasechnik it wa an opportun to realis mani of hi most cherish ambit in the fight against ill hi earli research wa promis he felt he could produc a cure to some form of cancer until then he had thought he would never have the resourc to complet hi work now he wa be given the chanc to develop on of the soviet union s most advanc laboratori in biotechnolog he accept the fact that the offer came from the ministri of defenc did not worri him unduli in the soviet union the militari wa the engin of most scientif research it had the cash and the peopl to run it even if a scientif project had a strictli civilian applic the militari wa still in charg it wa the soviet wai from 1974 to 1981 pasechnik built up hi special laboratori scour the countri until he had 400 peopl on hi staff a lavish budget and enough hard currenc to give hi scientist constant access to the latest biotechnolog advanc in the west the laboratori began it work in 1981 over the next two year pasechnik realis the truth far from be the heart of a new civilian research oper he wa at the centr of a vast network of factori and laboratori work on deadli new weapon of war offici we were involv in vaccin develop and in produc prepar for protect crop said pasechnik in fact we were develop method of product and equip for a huge biolog warfar programm to begin with pasechnik had littl idea of the scale of the oper onli later did he discov that as well as hi laboratori in leningrad there were two more in moscow two just outsid it and on in novosibirsk all work on the same project five manufactur plant emploi 15 000 peopl were oper in other part of the countri the oper known as biopreparat had a budget of 200m roubl and ten of million of american dollar a year it wa on of the best kept secret of the cold war it task wa to develop new strain of diseas more power than anyth known to scienc and to produc them in aerosol form the germ also had to be resist to antibiot avail to the nato armi of the west the specif job alloc to pasechnik s laboratori staff wa to make them effect weapon of war thei had to find wai of deliv the germ by artilleri shell bomb or missil to ensur that thei had a long life in the open air and that thei could be dispers over a wide area the breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institut of appli microbiolog at obolensk 60 mile south of moscow there with the help of work done at pasechnik s laboratori scientist develop their first super plagu a new strain of tularaemia a sever infecti bacteri diseas of man and domest anim carri by contact or insect bite it is name after tular california where it wa discov the test on it were suffici encourag for moscow to give permiss for full scale develop and product two year later the scientist at obolensk were ask to develop an even more deadli germ base on pneumon plagu anoth airborn infect pasechnik s job wa to refin the product process to make the oper more effici as a result by 1987 the soviet union had suffici industri capac to manufactur 200 kilo of the super plagu everi week enough to kill up to 500 000 peopl the super plagu germ wa of cours never manufactur on thi scale the germ had a short life and onli enough wa made for test but the biopreparat network stood on standbi readi to begin fullscal product when instruct at a time in the futur that wa design dai x here then wa a programm for produc the most devast genet engin weapon ever seen just wait to be given the go ahead tini quantiti of the russian super plagu could devast ani citi in the west kill million while leav build factori and raw materi intact thei would be the perfect design weapon at the soviet defenc ministri high rank gener were fulli awar of thi biolog capabl and built it into their militari plan known as the weapon of special design thei would be us not onli as a last resort but as support weapon in a convent non nuclear conflict to attack the enemi s troop reserv and hamper hi oper at port and rail centr everi part of thi programm wa in breach of the 1972 biolog and toxin warfar convent an intern agreement which the soviet union had sign it wa also against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been proclaim by mikhail gorbachev for pasechnik the gorbachev era wa a chanc to try to chang the direct of the programm at hi laboratori in late 1985 he pressur senior offici in biopreparat to let him switch some of hi research effort to the civilian purpos for which it had ostens been establish he got nowher i wa told mani time just to get on with my work and stai in my place he said pasechnik did just that by 1988 he had risen to a rank equival to that of major gener and wa in charg of two manufactur plant and three research laboratori two of these were work on biolog weapon the third wa given to him to placat hi desir to do civil work and also as a cover for the biolog warfar research but pasechnik wa increasingli uneasi he had no idea that hi work wa in breach of the 1972 treati he did not know such a treati exist but he felt that the weapon he wa help to develop were an abus of hi scientif skill and demonstr hypocrisi in the russian militari command about the gorbachev revolut abov all he felt passion that genet engin biolog weapon were a crime against human in late 1988 he began to think about defect despit hi long and illustri scientif career pasechnik had never been allow to travel outsid the soviet bloc then in the summer of 1989 biopreparat began negoti with a factori in toulous franc which manufactur equip for chemic laboratori pasechnik volunt to go to finalis the deal as a reward for hi overal perform permiss wa grant he arriv in franc at the begin of octob he had thought carefulli about how to escap the kgb watcher who travel with hi group on morn he telephon the british embassi in pari and in a brief convers with a surpris diplomat announc himself hi posit and hi wish to defect the new of hi offer reach the secret intellig servic si otherwis known as mi6 in london at a critic time for the previou five year si the american cia and a number of nato militari intellig organis had been try to piec togeth the snippet of inform thei had about the soviet biolog warfar programm in mai 1979 american intellig had heard report of an explos at a secret soviet research facil on the outskirt of sverdlovsk 850 mile east of moscow a leak of anthrax had kill up to a hundr peopl an area three mile downwind of the factori had been contamin the russian had tri to contain the damag with a widespread immunis programm but it had prove larg useless throughout the 1980 s the leak had been rais by both british and american offici with their soviet counterpart but the offici line remain the same that a hand of peopl had di in the citi after eat contamin meat bought on the black market there wa no biolog weapon programm snippet of inform from sourc in the soviet union suggest otherwis satellit pictur show plant and test site appar configur for the manufactur of biolog weapon the dia the defenc intellig agenc the pentagon s spi estim that the russian had up to eight site for develop and store biolog weapon si larg concur with that view and a seri of report were circul to intellig chief and british minist warn that the soviet biolog programm had not slow down as a result of the gorbachev reform as frequent happen when intellig is fragmentari the politician refus to hear the messag at the time all western govern had been seduc by gorbachev s reform the cold war wa thaw and no prime minist or presid wa prepar to risk a confront with the soviet union that might chang the delic balanc of intern relat at the same time there wa a sens that gorbachev wa an honour man who would not allow anyth as terribl as biolog weapon to be develop while he wa presid the intellig warn were ignor when the si station chief in pari flash the messag to london about the would be defector in toulous it caus consider excit at last here wa proof that would satisfi even the most sceptic politician pasechnik wa driven to pari and caught a british airwai flight to heathrow travel on fals paper suppli by british intellig as hi feet touch british soil pasechnik burst into tear the decis to leav hi countri and hi famili had place a terribl strain on the defector he had convinc himself that the work he had been do wa so terribl that he would probabl face seriou charg and perhap prison in the west it is a measur of hi courag that despit hi fear he step off the plane readi to tell all as soon as he wa settl in a safe hous outsid london he wa reassur that he had found a new home and not a prison cell there wa the normal nervous in si about ani defector wa he a plant all the indic were that he wa bona fide he did not know how to drive a clear sign that he wa a member of the privileg elit in the soviet union the distress he show when he recount the work he wa do wa imposs to fake then there wa hi love of mozart sonata which he would listen to in the even after yet anoth dinner with hi guardian the si debrief were quickli reassur he brought with him a wealth of new inform it wa stun said on of the debrief a whole ministri expos billion of roubl spent a complet organis shown to be a front then there wa the clear involv of gorbachev thi friend of the west it just went on and on to cope with all the inform pasechnik produc si the ministri of defenc and other govern depart set up a special task forc of scientist intellig offic and analyst to assess the intellig and put it into a wider context it wa painstak work but veri fruit as he describ hi entir life educ and work the taskforc understood for the first time the real relationship between the academi of scienc previous consid a pure civilian bodi and the soviet militari as is usual in such case the intellig glean from pasechnik wa share with the cia on both side of the atlant the mosaic of russia s biolog weapon programm wa gradual fill in as the pictur clear so both the cia and si began to brief their respect polit master for the first time the politician were given unambigu report clearli prepar on the basi of inform from a highli place defector to underlin the serious of the problem pasechnik wa brought out to brief senior offici on both side of the atlant the evid wa so compel that even the politician who had no wish to confront gorbachev were left with no choic in april 1990 the british and american govern jointli confront the soviet union with the evid and spell out in detail what thei knew there wa no reaction then in june 1990 presid georg bush and margaret thatcher met separ with gorbachev both rais the question of biolog weapon gorbachev deni all knowledg thatcher who believ she had a special close relationship with the soviet leader told him that unless the programm wa stop the west would go public gorbachev promis that he would look into the matter two month later the soviet foreign minist eduard shevardnadz sent a formal repli rebut the charg by thi time both the cia and si had produc an even more exhaust brief for bush and thatcher have succeed in forc action at the highest level after so mani year of frustrat the intellig commun wa determin to press it case until the russian confess in decemb 1990 the russian issu an invit to washington and london to visit four of the site that had been name a joint anglo american deleg wa dispatch if the trip wa intend to be reassur it had the opposit effect in obolensk the british discov a chamber for test biolog weapon suspend in an aerosol the steel room which wa 50 feet squar had post on the floor to which anim could be ti while vent in the ceil allow poison to be sprai into the room the team also discov a chamber us to test deliveri system for biolog weapon at anoth site there wa row after row of ferment us to mass produc hundr of kilo of biolog weapon a chill confirm of everyth pasechnik had reveal nevertheless the russian continu their denial in septemb 1991 a month after the attempt coup john major the new british prime minist met gorbachev in the kremlin publicli the two hour meet wa confin to econom issu but major confront him with the evid of the secret weapon programm again gorbachev deni everyth and move the normal unflapp major to wave an angri finger in the face of the russian leader we ve got the good on you he shout as the intellig commun continu ad to the file the confront with moscow continu through the fall of gorbachev and the rise to power of bori yeltsin on februari 1 1992 bush and yeltsin met for their first summit in advanc of the meet at camp david american diplomat made clear that the biolog weapon programm wa a major stumbl block between the two alli and a gestur by yeltsin in thi area would be seen as a sign of a new era in us russian relat thi time yeltsin came prepar he admit for the first time that there had inde been a secret programm and that he had order it to be shut down but it wa not for anoth month that yeltsin wa told by hi own offici of the full extent of the programm in march the russian militari final came clean thei had secretli develop bomb and missil capabl of carri the super plagu in defianc of intern agreement yeltsin sign a formal decre cancel the programm but the disinform did not stop there as promin russian offici involv in the biopreparat programm set about try to minimis the work thei had been involv in it wa a campaign fill with the kind of li and evas that were suppos to have vanish in the new era of democraci in russia for exampl gener valentin yevstigneyev assur the newspap nezavisimaya gazeta there were not as mani peopl involv as it might seem he maintain that the work of the variou laboratori wa essenti for civilian purpos he also tri to diminish the role of pasechnik reaction like these contribut to grow sceptic in both london and washington that yeltsin s order to dismantl the biopreparat project wa be carri out although the main test site wa report to have been shut down those monitor the project were hardli reassur when it wa announc that the man put in charg of the dismantl of biopreparat would be gener anatolii kuntsevich the architect of the soviet union s chemic weapon programm hi appoint wa seen as a sop to the hardlin in the militari on senior western intellig offici said here wa thi man who had done noth but lie to us for year on chemic weapon and now suddenli we ar suppos
