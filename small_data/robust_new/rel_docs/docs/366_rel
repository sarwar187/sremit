the channel of river that flow to the aral sea it wa compos of ecolog scientist writer journalist lawyer economist medic personnel and agricultur specialist from variou republ of the former ussr a great deal wa written about thi in newspap and magazin televis show fright film clip of seago vessel in the desert sand five year pass and in 1993 it wa decid to verifi whether anyth at all had been accomplish with respect to the commit onc made by the head of the ministri for water manag and the secretari of the central committe of the communist parti of central asian republ and appropri oblast committe the result wa depress exactli noth had chang the fact that the aral sea is gradual dry up turn into a desert whose dust is scatter over thousand of kilomet ha alreadi becom a commonli known dread realiti but no on ha as yet serious rais the question of just what man is do with the desert and someth horribl is happen countless lake have been form in kyzylkum into which water discharg satur with toxic chemic and fertil flow off from reservoir thi water penetr the sand and goe into well from which the resid of the desert livestock breeder drink and provid water to their livestock still greater destruct influenc on the desert s ecosystem is be exert by the mine and metallurgi industri for more than 30 year now uranium gold and other metal have been extract in these part in the region of uchkuduk alon more than 1 5 billion cubic meter of earth ha been turn over shovel up the area is strewn as well with mountain heap contain unextract radioact isotop radium radon whose dust is carri by the wind fund for land reclam were built into the cost estim in time howev it wa decid to us these veri fund to lower the cost of extract develop of the technolog involv the underground leach method for extract uranium have time and again receiv state award and prize among those award is academician b laskorin in whose view the method is ecolog clean doubt thi i at that time a worker in the parti apparatu ask him to offici confirm the ecolog safeti of the method the academician refus even at that time inform reach me from other scientist that with the applic of thi method a minimum of 20 percent of sulfur acid remain in the underground seam the desert s subsoil water have been the first to suffer from thi transform over time into littl reservoir of sulfur acid poison the live desert around them in the meantim it is well known that these underground water constitut precis the main sourc of water in kyzylkum a similar situat ha come about with respect to the extract of gold academician laskorin ha declar it technolog as well to be ecolog clean self contain and safe ani harm influenc to the environ can be rule out there is a minimum of airborn discharg and the complet absenc of ani kind of sewag these ar the word of the academician but can we agre with such assur for over 24 year now gold ha been extract from the muruntau mine near zarafshan the cost of extract in 1970 wa onli about 3 rubl per gram the fact of the matter is that it never even occur to anyon to includ in thi cost expens relat to damag inflict on the environ sodium cyanid compris part of the wast of thi process it wa also origin envisag that the ground would be protect from penetr by thi toxin dispos channel were suppos to be cover with concret on top of doubl layer synthet sheet about 1 million squar meter of sheet wa purchas to thi end but it never us for it intend purpos no on know where it disappear to toxic pulp wa pour off into low ly area precis where a geolog fault line run gold reserv locat in uzbekistan amount to approxim 4 500 tonn over the past quarter centuri more than 1 000 tonn of gold have been extract from muruntau alon the govern present intend to doubl the output of gold thi mean that in about 10 year onli half of the republ s gold rich will remain and in anoth 20 30 year virtual noth will remain of thi preciou metal which natur ha so gener provid the land in thi regard wherea in russia and a number of other republ of the former ussr an activ process of reorgan of the economi is underwai no fundament chang in thi sphere have taken place in uzbekistan over it two year of independ the same state enterpris remain virtual the same rule cadr ar there there is not even ani talk about privat of enterpris etc accordingli all preciou metal and raw materi resourc be extract will continu to go as befor toward fill up hole and attempt to keep the unhealthi economi afloat but let us return to kyzylkum everyon now know full well that for over 30 year the ussr ministri of medium machin build exercis absolut rule in thi region thi ministri wa a state within a state and oper under the stamp top secret it is thi monster of develop social

FBIS3-23861: languag russian articl type cso interview with aleksandr menshov chief engin of the severovostokzoloto associ by delovoi mir correspond vladimir androsenko the hen ha laid golden egg text magadan the gold mine industri of the northeast surviv in 1993 in spite of the tremend difficulti extract of the preciou metal in magadan oblast togeth with chukotka decreas by nearli 3 500 kilogram to a total of 40 metric ton about on third of all russian product with the extraordinari increas in price for fuel equip and materi the mine enterpris lost stabil but remain afloat so some hope sign have appear in the far north s economi and miner can look to the futur with greater confid now our correspond began an interview with aleksandr menshov chief engin of the severovostokzoloto associ with thi question menshov we cannot speak about normal of the mine industri yet gold mine enterpris in the far north can produc output onli dure the summer dure the placer season the rest of the year we get readi for the season we work the strip rock we bring gold bear sand up to the surfac from the pit and we repair the equip but sinc the monei for the metal is receiv onli after it is sold all thi must be done on credit thi is where the stumbl block is the miner themselv ar not in a posit to financ the expenditur for futur period after pai all the tax and levi thei have hardli enough for minim social need consequ the question concern the sourc for financ these outlai if the govern the main buyer of our product give us an advanc payment the enterpris will function and russia will have gold if it doe not it will have noth last year the komdragmet committe on preciou metal and preciou stone understood thi clear depend it financ us on time and the result ar appar the associ cut back extract of the metal by 8 percent when there wa a downturn of 20 and 30 percent at the bilibino and polyarnyi mine and concentr combin which had left the severovostokzoloto organ and did not receiv the proper support but now there ha been no advanc payment and strip ha alreadi decreas by 10 percent in januari compar with last year the sector s collaps ha not been rule out altogeth a komdragmet repres told gold mine manag at a confer on 17 decemb 1993 that a minimum of half the fund need would be provid befor 15 februari we also form our econom polici on the basi of thi promis but by the end of januari it wa suddenli reveal that there would be no monei and that the komdragmet is just begin it search for credit but is thi ani wai to conduct busi we have been liter driven into a corner after all androsenko aleksandr aleksandrovich accord to some report a govern decre is be prepar which author the bank to purchas gold from it produc doe thi mean that our govern want to shift some of the expens to the businessmen as well menshov i am deepli convinc that such a decis will be veri detriment to state interest ye at first glanc consider save ar indic for the budget by stipul it right to purchas 50 percent of the metal the state therebi reduc the amount of it advanc payment these ar sizabl sum for exampl we now need 210 billion rubl r in last decemb s price it seem profit especi as the commerci bank ar readi and will to financ the gold miner for the remaind of our output but in realiti there is no benefit here a huge profit is simpli slip into privat hand think about it we ar sell gold at r15 000 per gram at it current world price but the price of a gram is alreadi more than r50 000 in the jewelri store and thi differ will exist for quit a long period of time at present two third of the market valu of gold item is supplement the russian budget but if the decre you mention is issu thi will begin fill the pocket of the businessmen i think that concern for the budget should forc the govern to reject thi undertak and return to the previou system of financ and settlement but thi must be done more quickli for time is more valuabl than monei now androsenko it is no secret that the severovostokzoloto enterpris ar oper mainli at placer deposit we cannot speak about increas the proport of bedrock deposit becaus of the high capit output ratio the associ wa not abl to offer anyth even to develop the kubaka with it 100 metric ton of easili extract gold and thi tidbit went to a russian american joint ventur so you ar destin to fade awai at the placer to the extent that thei ar deplet menshov for the first time last year we extract more metal than we increas reserv dure the entir gold season in the kolyma thi wa the result of the breakdown in geolog work not the exhaust of natur resourc but we have enough even of the reserv that have alreadi been explor and protect for a good 20 to 25 year of cours the qualiti of the placer is declin their gold content is decreas and more strip must be done our onli chanc is to reduc the product cost of mine in particular we have now develop a new technolog for extract the metal without the us of cyanid it introduct will make it possibl to reduc the cost of product by nearli on half there ar other advanc idea as well but you ar right the tendenc to fade awai mai turn out to be quit strong the caus ar root in the unhealthi principl in organ the economi as an exampl we have not actual modern our fix capit for 3 year now there is no monei the level of tax now is such that simpli noth is left for reproduct and develop but us credit mean hang a millston around our neck take the kubaka we need a minimum of 100 million r150 billion to develop it commerci loan ar now provid at a minimum of 213 percent interest per annum the maximum extract of gold there is 8 to 10 metric ton annual taken at todai s price the entir cost of product will be less than it cost just to servic the debt is thi realli conceiv for a produc after all a joint ventur undertook to develop the deposit onli becaus the american side wa abl to obtain normal civil loan at 6 percent interest for the program but by deal with russian commerci shark the sp joint ventur would be bankrupt right awai after all thi involv deposit which ar superprofit by world standard but what can we sai about our placer then but after all the farther we go the wors it is thu far over 50 percent of the product s valu ha been collect in the form of tax a littl over 37 percent ha made up the product cost 10 percent ha gone to maintain the social infrastructur and 1 5 to 2 percent ha been us to assist those with low incom and pension on the mainmland to pai for contain and so forth in 1994 accord to our calcul the tax on properti alon will be increas by at least 24 time as much becaus of the reassess of fix capit announc by the govern the rate of the tax on profit ar also be increas product cost will rise sharpli for the new tax system will forc our supplier to rais the price of their product there is on more neg factor it is no secret to economist that the ministri of financ ha been support the underst exchang rate of the dollar until veri recent i do not know in whose interest thi is but it is clearli not in the interest of the domest produc let us sai that transact with us for gold ar conduct at the world price on the basi of such a regul exchang rate but at the same time we ar purchas petroleum product materi and equip at price which ar twice the world price where is the logic after all thi is not a struggl to normal the economi at all for inflat and the budget deficit onli increas to the extent that product volum decreas and unbalanc price exert a direct influenc on thi so i can definit state that the main reason that gold mine enterpris will fade awai if thi take place will not be the exhaust of natur resourc but econom polici androsenko aleksandr aleksandrovich the severovostokzoloto associ wa almost broken apart into numer fragment as the result of purpos pressur from the top fortun you manag to stop the process of self destruct but voic call for reunif ar alreadi be heard todai in the enterpris that left from under your wing what ha happen menshov ye thei ar speak more insist about return at the polyarnyi and bilibino gok mine and concentr combin the dukat gok ha state unequivoc that it will becom part of a hold compani after sharehold is introduc in the form of a joint stock compani discuss among the prospector about the separ have been discontinu we now have 202 artel in oper and a total of 21 have left us the solut is quit simpl on cannot surviv alon in the north severovostokzoloto ha maintain ti with it supplier and is work with them without middlemen which is significantli cheaper and faster by combin the enterpris fund we can deliv everyth need in time and therebi ensur uninterrupt product how can an individu gok pai a billion rubl in advanc for a steamship carri explos but togeth we ar find thi monei we have paid in full for the tanker come to magadan thei attempt to accus us of monopol here becaus we us thi fuel ourselv and do not share it with anyon but after all these ar normal market relationship why should we suppli other to the detriment of our placer and artel it is hard for them now but after all thi is becaus thei left us at on time in search of an easier life there is none in the north and there cannot be under extrem natur and climat condit ala it is not to no purpos that popular wisdom divid those who learn from other mistak and those who prefer to make their own we ar not gloat what pleasur can there be here when everyth that ha been built up is be ruin and when our econom space is be remov and we ar alwai prepar to unit on sensibl principl to surviv togeth androsenko over the past 3 year the territori ha lost on quarter of it popul peopl ar leav becaus thei ar tire of the north the gener disorgan the poor suppli and most imporantli the lack of confid in the futur the lack of prospect but how do the miner feel menshov like everyon els thei ar hope that the govern will be sensibl and the author must be more honest too thei should be direct in state whether russia need the north s gold and act in accord with thi the situat here is veri simpl the lack of financ in advanc mean the treasuri doe not have 40 metric ton of the preciou metal delai the advanc until mai mean reduc the output by 40 percent onli it is not necessari to speak about the unprofit of it product for the budget i have alreadi mention the compar price for gold in sell to the state and by the state i will also remind you that half of the monei we receiv goe for tax and the budget right awai a substanti part of the budgetari incom is hidden in the product cost through the tax payment of our supplier and in the incom tax on gold miner wage our sector is truli the hen lai golden egg for the countri it can be kill of cours but then we must question the respons of it owner

discuss first is determin the scope of cooper and develop gold mine which have been preliminarili consid to be of low grade to contain arsen carbon and other materi or to have difficulti in or dress and smelt and those which ar consid to have difficulti in mine or dress and smelt given the exist technolog of the mainland but which have good prospect for exploit can be approv for carri out experi on mine in cooper with foreign businessmen second is determin requir for select point for experi and procedur for approv develop project gener speak mine with suffici domest prospect data and rel favor extern construct condit can be select for experi in cooper with foreign countri in mine gold the procedur for approv cooper project should be like thi gold manag depart of variou provinc should first put forward a report of intent on a cooper project after thi report is examin by the ministri of metallurg industri it is to be submit to the state plan commiss and the state econom and trade commiss for examin and approv befor negoti ar held third is determin the principl for carri out experi on cooper in gold mine at select point and wai of introduc foreign capit a preliminari view under consider is that the chines side mai us as capit for cooper miner resourc land water and electr suppli facil mine equip and so on and the foreign side mai us fund technolog and equip as their share of

mouth of river ha becom much faster and more evid and it ha not been without effect in creat problem for the coastal citi if we continu at thi rate the us forest in northern iran which have tree usabl in industri will be destroi in the next five year thi is part of a report from the monthli public jame e ye salem publish in tehran entitl iran s environ written by dr ali hazuri the report s author continu in the last two year we have seen faster and more extens soil eros throughout iran howev these event ar mostli happen in area where there were formerli forest or suitabl plant cover and have now becom bare such as the height of gilan mazandaran chahar mahal va bakhtiari and doshmanziari in western far the rate of sediment at dam ha increas and no solut ha been found even in place where resourc come to hand suddenli and with the help of natur there is noth we can do in the year 1371 21 march 1992 20 march 1993 the water level at iran s dam were much lower than in the year 1370 21 march 1991 20 march 1992 for exampl at the zayandehrud dam it wa about seven meter lower as a result of the fall water level a great volum of the sediment at the mouth of the dam reservoir rose out of the water and could have been remov with ordinari equip clearli the readi to do thi task did not exist and no work wa done pastur and field overrun an import part of iran s field and pastur ha been destroi in the last 30 year becaus of the increas popul the spread of the citi and the establish of factori warehous and militari base even now instead of build these kind of instal on unsuit land thei ar us best land for thi purpos for exampl the metal foundri plant wa built next to the citi of asfarin wa alloc the best agricultur land next to the citi after it construct thi plant took over almost all the irrig land adjac to the citi and even the citi itself is threaten by the creation of pollut the dai when cheap fuel is no longer avail for these factori and thei ar face with closur their land will also be of no us and thei will be absorb by the rapid expans of the citi and the popul explos in hi report the author also discuss the destruct of forest in other part of iran in recent year there is no small number of other area in iran that have lost their plant cover in recent year the doshmanziari area which wa complet forest in the year 1357 21 march 1978 20 march 1979 ha

and the destruct of the environ in thi region is also evid the strip of iran s pastur is an obviou phenomenon which anyon can see throughout iran thi is also the result of the popul increas includ the tribal popul and greater need for livestock product sound of alarm the author of the report on iran s environ discuss the death of iran s green forest pastur and agricultur field and the extinct of anim such as the eleph of southern iran the lion throughout the south and east of iran the tiger in mazandaran and the deer of azerbaijan accord to him these were not destroi by the earthquak but rather when mani iranian in these year obtain firearm and shot them with bullet of cours there wa even more savag treatment of the boar herd in lorestan and mazandaran he also warn about the strip of

and cure depress tryptophan is thought to do thi by boost the brain s level of the chemic serotonin but the same effect can be gotten at less expens and with less risk of overload the bodi by mere drink a glass of milk at bedtim said richard wurtman a massachusett institut of technolog research whose work show the serotonin link help popular tryptophan wurtman said he worri that the unregul us of tryptophan mean peopl ar overload their bodi with it and ar do so without know basic precaut it will amplifi the effect of certain antidepress hypertens or antipsychot drug and should never be taken befor drive or danger activ he note tryptophan s perceiv statu as a nutrit good gui provid an interest contrast to the neg imag of a sister amino acid the flavor enhanc monosodium glutam the glutam part of msg is an amino acid and like tryptophan is a neurotransmitt affect the delic cell of the brain and nervou system it is excess of glutam that ar blame for that letharg headachi condit often call chines restaur syndrom yet the same peopl who worri that a chines restaur is us msg might go home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep part of the difficulti in determin whether amino acid supplement ar good or bad is that their variou path through the bodi and interact with on anoth ar complic and so far not veri well studi the point is we know veri littl about what happen in term of flow of materi in the bodi especi for amino acid like tryptophan said dwight matthew associ professor at cornel medic colleg in new york citi matthew tack radioact atom onto amino acid and then trace their biolog path you can go back to almost ani eat studi and look at how amino acid level chang after a meal but there s not a lot in term of the kinet what happen to it later matthew said at uc davi biochemist gietzen note that studi of rat show that concentr of amino acid in blood vari wide depend on whether the anim ha been fast or ha just eaten the composit of the most recent meal and the time of dai cite a paper she us as a refer gietzen said there ar wide variat in amino acid level in plasma that ar consid averag for tryptophan the averag rang in men is from 30 to 90 nanogram per millilit of plasma for women it rang from 24 to 76 with that wide a rang how can normal be determin she ask befor an individu s amino acid defici could be reliabl determin she said multipl blood sampl would be requir over the cours of the dai for sever dai if thei had a consist pattern you could mayb recommend ad someth to the diet but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to give it to them in pill gietzen said becaus thei can toler it better in a combin with other amino acid than singli feder health offici who ar investig the outbreak of the blood diseas eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much if thei find evid of larg dose in peopl who acquir the diseas howev the fact that supplement have been wide us for year is seen as an indic that the problem mai be due instead to contamin of the crystallin tryptophan powder import from oversea matthew of cornel note that for hi studi he ha to verifi the puriti of the amino acid powder befor administ it to research subject and he frequent find contamin time and time again i find some veri strang impur matthew said that in my opinion is on of the best place to look the japanes have develop good method for assur puriti of their product but a chang in procedur could result in contamin of new batch he said in addit the high price of japanes amino acid would put econom pressur on us compani to mix them with cheaper product produc with less qualiti control he said he note that the complex chemic method us for make tryptophan and other amino acid often involv toxic substanc such as hydrogen cyanid we re not talk about natur food he said we re talk about special prepar individu compound and in almost ani case you can get the same effect just by eat right you can pick natur food that ar a littl bit richer in specif amino acid and get along just fine wurtman in hi role as inadvert father of the tryptophan craze want the fda to classifi amino acid as drug the sad truth is it probabl work he said of tryptophan but i would hope veri much that the percept that these amino acid sold by the present rout mai be caus big problem will caus us to rethink complet whether we should allow them to be sold as so call nutrit supplement
