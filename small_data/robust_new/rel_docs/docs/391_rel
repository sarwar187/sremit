can be sold direct to the consum without prescript the link up in over the counter otc drug between three of the world s big drug group while the most ambiti to date is unlik to be the last the most obviou effect of the industri s shift in strategi is to transfer power from the scientist to the market man in term of prescript drug warner lambert is much the weakest of the three compani but it is a giant in us consum market it advertis budget is the 11th largest in the us support product such as listerin mouth wash and benylin cough syrup it also ha a 600 strong us sale forc and otc sale around the world of dollar 1 2bn wellcom ha otc sale of dollar 400m and sell mostli through broker glaxo ha no otc product and no sale forc it is therefor warner lambert which domin the joint ventur thi is despit the fact that by common consent of the parti the chief attract of the deal li in forthcom otc product from glaxo and wellcom glaxo s zantac an ulcer treatment is the biggest sell prescript drug in the world zovirax wellcom s anti viral treatment is the eighth biggest the aim is to sell zantac as an indigest pill and zovirax as a cream for cold sore or in the us as a pill for genit herp mr john robb wellcom s chief execut explain the logic yesterdai the differ between the econom of prescript drug and otc medicin is that in prescript drug your big cost come befor you reach the market with an otc product it s the other wai round the market cost in year on can be as big as your revenu and it can take seven or eight year to get your pai out therefor said mr robb the trick is to build up consum awar of the drug in it last year on prescript that wai it ha a fly start when it is convert to otc wellcom claim to have done thi with it cough medicin actif and sudaf and to be do it now with zovirax inde all but on of the top 15 otc medicin launch in the us sinc 1975 have been former prescript drug but it need the market muscl of a warner lambert to hustl them along with their oper behind us mr robb said we re like to get a much faster lift off and better penetr with zovirax than we would do through a hand of broker and warner lambert can bui advertis much more cheapli and get more shelf space sinc mr robb is himself a consum market man by train it is hard to believ he doe not chafe at be junior partner in the ventur but he treat the fact stoical i couldn t

safeti you can t do that with more than two drug on rate limit problem can be manufactur tradition you d make sai 5kg of a drug for a trial sai dr carter at bristol myer squibb and if the trial look good you d make anoth 5kg for a potenti blockbust we d make it all at the start in the past if you didn t do that you d save monei but by hedg your bet it might take two year longer to develop the compound you have to plan for success rather than failur draw up a design for the clinic trial and then stick to it is also import accord to dr robert spiegel senior vice presid clinic research at schere plough the major improv come from have an agre aim when you start the process and then it s go to sound like a clich do it right first time you have to make sure everyon agre what you re try to
