articl soviet worker he wrote us to joke that the govern pretend to pai them while thei pretend to work todai the west pretend to give aid to yeltsin in russia who in turn pretend to implement reform let us leav on hoagland s conscienc the claim that reform ar not be implement in russia but it is true that the west is pretend more than help it is suffici to recal that in 1992 for exampl the volum of aid from the unit state and japan in respect of all the countri of the former soviet bloc did not exce on hundredth of 1 percent of the us and japanes gnp franc and britain also confin themselv to scrap germani alon stand out it grant russia 3 9 billion over five time as much as the unit state these ar data for 1992 the final result have not yet been sum up for 1993 but it is alreadi known that there will be no fundament differ compar with the preced period it would not be out of place to take a look at what the fund which actual have been alloc give to russia take the follow fact in 1993 the unit state extend to our countri credit of 700 million to bui grain over 15 year but at the same time it stipul that 75 percent of the shipment of thi grain across the ocean had to be made on us ship and moreov at highli inflat tariff wherea it cost 15 000 17 000 a dai to charter a liberian ship a us on cost 25 000 30 000 thu in fact almost all the 700 million goe to us grain produc and shipown russia get the debt and the interest on the debt it should also be emphas that credit is frequent hedg about with all kind of condit which quit often go beyond the gener accept framework of relat between equal partner these condit can be divid into sever group the first group is polit the lender for it is not usual a question of fund provid grati but precis of loan for a particular term and at a particular sometim veri high rate of interest advanc demand that russia implement it reform from a certain standpoint and at a certain pace sometim disregard intern condit and the countri s nation interest moreov although peopl in the west like to sai that aid is given in the hope of continu the polici of democrat reform and not with a view to individu person in practic it is frequent possibl to hear recommend as to who must and who must not be a member of the govern for instanc the polit condit also includ attempt to tell russia how to deal with close neighbor and what it can and cannot reach agreement with them about the second group of condit is exclus econom the imf is particularli bad in thi regard the imf make the alloc of fund condit on permiss in it view level of inflat pace of privat and other criteria which undoubtedli relat to the intern compet of sovereign state natur the imf take no respons for the consequ of fulfil it condit which it prefer to call recommend the third group of condit relat to the desir to hinder russia s access to world market and to undermin the competit of it export there ar more than enough fact here there is a mass of artifici obstacl to export of russian uranium although you would think that all the agreement on thi had been reach long ago there is the demand to reduc russian aluminum export by half a million tonn there ar the obstacl to russia s involv in commerci launch of spacecraft and much much more besid when speak of all these condit final i cannot fail to mention the direct blackmail to which western countri sometim resort i have alreadi spoken of the numer assur that russia will be given veri broad assist and support but i could also cite mani statement threaten to end all assist the unit state could revis it polici of give aid to moscow if the russian govern embark on a path of slow the process of econom reform the christian scienc monitor point out cite offici in the washington administr the japanes foreign ministri ha dissemin a report that the g 7 countri might not agre to the propos to includ russia among the full particip in their annual meet although onli recent thi idea wa be discuss activ such a polici toward present dai russia can onli be call shortsight what our countri need is not mythic aid hedg about moreov with a mass of condit but equit cooper with western state and broad access to world market where in an honest competit struggl russian produc would be abl both to show and to see for themselv what thei ar worth precis thi idea wa champion by russia s repres at the recent world econom forum in davo with or without the support of western countri russia will all the same go it own wai but in the former case thi path would be easier and less pain and not onli for us for western countri too thei would not need to fear unpredict turn in russian polit instead of just pretend to help us it is in the interest of the west itself to go over to full cooper with russia it is in our interest to continu our reform still more consist onli far more sensibl than hitherto not reject assist from elsewher but not put too much trust in it either

such in my view wa clinton s recent statement that russia should not put the brake on but continu the polici of reform with the same persist and the unit state in turn should redoubl effort to assist these reform such proviso can onli reinforc suspicion that the reform in the form in which thei have so far been implement ar advantag to the unit state rather than to russia thi is not to mention the

ci in the present stage ha been unabl to becom an econom union of the state that emerg from the depth of the ussr despit all the contradictori interest of the commonwealth countri the ci nonetheless continu to exist it is altogeth like that apart from the temporari and rel econom reason for preserv the commonwealth there ar polit condit forc these state to keep togeth iii at thi time on mai ponder three variant of the develop of event first variant the ci acquir a more precis structur and other republ ar drawn toward russia thi scenario in all probabl would be accompani by russia s take a tougher approach to the commonwealth and the need to ensur support for it on the part of the russian peripheri second variant sever subregion allianc with vari degre of integr econom militari polit and so on form within the ci while observ the principl of inviol of border the bilater ti of the state constitut the basi of the subregion allianc essenti thi variant describ the present condit of interrel within the commonwealth and it mai find increas support on the part of the republ but thi form of the commonwealth is unstabl sinc the situat in the republ is unstabl third variant it is at least theoret possibl that a new polit econom format could aris on the basi of the ci and region associ which includ adjac area of sever former union republ would claim the role of subject in it on a par with the republ chanc that such an associ mai aris must not be exagger but it is extrem import to follow the trend toward establish a special form of direct ti among region of the independ state of the ci carefulli when the subject of relat ar on the on hand the central author of an independ state the govern of ukrain for exampl and on the other the administr of the nation territori format which ar part of the russian feder for exampl yakutia the republ of sakha anoth exampl of thi type is the republ of kazakhstan s treati with tataria and bashkiria up to thi point the govern of russia ha not taken similar step in relat to it partner in the ci howev there is everi reason to consid them immin and us at least in relat to region of east ukrain the crimea oblast of the north black sea region and the dnester region which ar drawn toward develop of comprehens ti with the russian feder but under all the scenario for the develop of the situat it is obviou that the ci doe not have a chanc in the forese futur of becom a suprast format abl to act collect as a us partner on the strateg econom and polit issu of intern relat allow percept of the ussr to be transfer by inertia to the commonwealth of independ state ha continu to be signific for washington for a fairli long time now and again it might have seem that all american politician relat to the ci more as a suprast than an interst format while for the commonwealth countri themselv undoubtedli includ russia right from the start prioriti wa veri definit given to precis nation sovereignti howev without question in principl the need to maintain the polici of cooper with moscow the american side at the same time ha not found suffici weighti argument in favor of maintain it on the level which the soviet american dialogu reach under m s gorbachev but in the first month after the dissolut of the soviet union at least two new element in the approach to relat with the russian abroad were denot the first wa that at that point appar have overcom it doubt the american leadership made the choic to take a bilater approach to the state of the former ussr in term of terminolog thi wa reflect in abandon the expand us of the combin ci and replac it in offici statement with the express new independ state which earlier had been appli onli to the former member of the yugoslav feder croatia and slovenia at the same time howev the reject of the supra countri approach to the state which were successor of the ussr illumin polit and other specif of the present stage of develop of each of them either in term of the path of liber pluralist transform or along the line of protect effort of on degre of stringenc or anoth under thi approach the moral advantag of the russian path for overcom totalitarian becom clear and the imag of russia win out and is enrich by posit featur it is not accident and thi is the second peculiar of american polici that the clinton administr ha taken an activ stanc toward the domest process on the territori of the former ussr abov all in russia openli and insist announc it support of the radic reformist cours of presid b yeltsin and organ intern public opinion accordingli the russian american summit meet held in vancouv in april 1993 wa onli a gener symbol of w clinton s new moral polit activ and a return to the american polici of tradit ethic valu and ideal which he promis wa behind it needless to sai demonstr of solidar with the democrat reform in russia must not be equat with actual us readi to devot primari attent in american foreign polici to russian american relat such as wa devot to soviet american relat russia ha not replac the soviet union in american prefer and in 1992 russia s role in the hierarchi of american foreign polici prioriti wa perhap even reduc compar with the almost self suffici signific of soviet american polit relat russian american relat in the final stage of the republican reign prove to be more like mere a deriv of us interest on issu of the nonprolifer of nuclear weapon and militari high technolog as well as weapon control washington s interest acquir a kind of neg tone the unit state strictli defin what russia should not be for

on thi issu is quit definit the appear in eurasia as in ani other part of the world of new nuclear power is not in american secur interest and washington firmli intend to oppos it inasmuch as absolut the same thing can be said about russia too there ar veri solid reason for russian american partnership on the issu of nuclear nonprolifer us concern primarili over the nuclear aspect of the strateg

good will toward the russian presenc on the contrari the question of the american percept of russian arm forc in the territori of the baltic region and moldavia the withdraw of which the govern of these countri ar try to ensur in the latter case with vari insist continu to sting but there is reason to assum that the unit state principl support of their demand will not becom a seriou problem in russian american relat if russia s diplomaci is consist and insist in explain the temporari natur of the russian troop stai there as well as the econom and organiz reason delai their withdraw there ar suffici reason to explain the delai in withdraw troop from moldavia and the dnester region the clear desir of the left bank popul the role of the russian armi in prevent a major intern moldavian

the first articl wa print in ssha epi no 12 1993 second articl iv sinc the start of 1992 the us administr ha begun to grant aid and strengthen econom ti with the ci countri on a larg scale in the 1992 fiscal year the government agenc for intern develop spent 235 million dollar for these purpos in 1993 the us govern alloc 417 million in accord with a law support freedom adopt in the summer of 1992 and anoth 412 million in the form of outright food aid to russia armenia georgia moldova belaru kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan apart from that in order to expand credit of the former soviet republ by the intern monetari fund the unit state increas it contribut to the imf in 1992 by 12 billion dollar and agre to contribut half of the 6 billion dollar earmark to form a currenc stabil fund in the new state on the territori of the former soviet union a distinct featur of the new stage in us trade econom ti with the sovereign republ is the organ of direct contact with their author in our opinion it wa not the particular interest of the unit state which plai the decis role in select such an approach but the action of the republ themselv which for object reason too demonstr an inabl to creat a strong econom union in the current stage of their develop with the rare except not on of the republ is given prefer on the offici level either as a recipi of american humanitarian and technic aid or as a potenti trade partner or object of invest the neg exampl of azerbaijan which by an amend to the law on support of freedom wa depriv of the right to receiv humanitarian aid in 1993 mai perhap serv as the onli except although the link between the support grant to the republ and their resolv to carri out econom reform wa made veri clear the administr s repres ar successfulli avoid categor assess and prefer on can speak of the lack of privileg for certain state howev onli in relat to emerg humanitarian aid but as to the rest the prioriti of relat with certain of the post soviet republ show quit clearli through the formal equival of us econom ti with all the post soviet republ russia is undoubtedli given first place and militari strateg consider plai no less a role in thi than pure econom factor moreov take into account that the democrat in the kremlin cost less than nuclear missil the unit state ha been inclin to concess to russia which the other state of the former ussr have been unabl to expect for exampl the imf in which the unit state plai the lead role ha never appli to russia the rigor rule us when grant credit to latvia and estonia the annual total of loan to both countri wa divid into four equal part and everi 3 month the fund would check to see whether the govern were compli with the condit place on them and onli then would the next 25 percent of the appropri be alloc for these same reason the unit state pai greater attent to the other nuclear republ especi ukrain and kazakhstan apart from the unit state interest in preserv stabil in russia and ukrain the special natur of relat with these republ is also the result of their signific to the economi of the unit state itself russia account for more than half of the american export to the former soviet union after russia and ukrain delai payment on american food credit in the winter of 1993 the us deputi secretari of agricultur j omar wa compel to acknowledg washington need a program to guarante continu sale of american grain to russia and ukrain sinc the unit state cannot afford to lose those market the interest of busi also determin the distribut of direct foreign invest in the former soviet economi from septemb 1991 through septemb 1992 the volum of influx of foreign capit invest includ the follow 9 1 billion dollar to kazakhstan 7 billion to russia 237 million to lithuania 197 million to ukrain 159 million to latvia 88 million to estonia and 40 million dollar to azerbaijan the list of former soviet republ except the baltic countri which us short term credit from the us export import bank in 1992 to financ american export is veri similar to the previou list thei includ belaru kazakhstan uzbekistan russia and ukrain the group of countri which in 1992 sign agreement with the us depart of commerc also differ onli slightli in make up armenia russia belaru ukrain kazakhstan uzbekistan and moldova but even so there were undisput favorit among these republ in order to

russia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan armenia and ukrain and ha been prepar a project focus on the convers of the militari industri of the ci countri special group of advisor whose job includ creat a favor climat for attract american invest in the convers of the defens industri will be sent onc again to russia ukrain and kazakhstan it wa precis to those three countri where american farmer were also sent in 1992 which mark the begin of a new project at a cost of 30 million dollar for develop of farm in the commonwealth state but the public democraci corp which is larg engag in offer servic to experienc american businessmen in the area of product market financ privat and creation of new firm had onli on offic in moscow and plan to open them in kiev and alma ata it is symptomat that in late 1992 when the american bar associ held a confer on foreign invest in the former ussr the topic wa limit to onli three republ russia ukrain and kazakhstan incident the unit state sign agreement allow compani and their employe to avoid dual taxat on their incom onli with these three countri thi creat on of the main condit necessari for success movement of american capit into those market all thi illustr that in the near futur it is precis russia ukrain and kazakhstan which will remain the focu of the unit state econom polici in the former ussr us militari strateg interest and the prioriti of american busi which is interest in these state market and natur resourc also prompt thi choic armenia and kyrgyzstan will most like be next in term of signific without count the baltic state armenia to a signific extent becaus of the effort of the armenian lobbi which is fairli influenti in the unit state as well as the result of the consist implement of radic econom reform kyrgyzstan exclus becaus of the resolv shown by the govern to build a democrat market economi in the shortest possibl time and in both case the state interest of the unit state which is try to acquir as an alli a

in the event the conflict in tajikistan escal with involv of afghanistan and uzbekistan not to mention the mightier neighbor power as for belaru it construct and definit respons to question on
