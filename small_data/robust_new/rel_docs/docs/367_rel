that resolut that is secur council resolut 661 at the moment the committe is compos of 15 member which ar also member of the secur council you ar well awar that thei ar the five perman member which ar china franc russia the unit kingdom and the unit state and also the 10 nonperman member thei ar argentina brazil the czech republ djibouti new zealand nigeria pakistan oman rwanda and spain the committe ha establish it guid line to guid the conduct of it work mainli the princip rule is that a decis ha to be made by consensu thi mean that ani approv for ani applic for instanc would have to be approv by all 15 member in the committe if on of them is against such approv or is not in a posit to agre to ani applic that mean that applic would not be allow to be export to iraq i have to mention anoth point it is that the respons for implement of that resolut rest with the govern that mean all applic would have to come through govern channel to thi committe if ani individu or ani compani wish to export anyth to iraq he mai through the govern channel here mayb the ministri of financ and then in turn through the jordanian perman mission to the unit nation to submit the request to thi committe that is the normal procedur otherwis if ani request is submit to the committe directli by that compani or merchant then the committe would to have return it would have to start from the veri begin so that take time so pleas if there is ani request submit them through the jordanian govern i also want to sai that apart from medicin and health suppli which ar exempt from the sanction there ar foodstuff which also need onli notif to thi committe apart from these two categori most applic concern request for export to iraq of commod regard as basic civilian need item and these item fall under procedur which is describ in paragraph 20 of secur council resolut 687 as the simplifi and acceler non object procedur which mean the request when it is submit to the requeste would have to be comment on by all 15 member of the committe within a certain time limit if no neg comment is receiv that mean that applic is automat approv but if a member or some member ar not in a posit to approv such a request thei will notifi the committe of their posit and that on will not be approv but of cours the final decis would be made at a committe meet which would be discuss and then a final decis would be made onc a final decis is made then a respons from the chairman that is a letter sign by the chairman will be address to the origin request that is the perman mission of a certain countri which ha submit that request to the committe on behalf of ani individu or busi so in that sens if it is approv an approv letter would be sign if it is reject a refus letter would be sign and there ar mani case becaus of the lack of inform pertain to that specif request and some member ar not yet readi to have a final decis on that we call that to put a certain request on hold to shelv it and in the meantim to seek further inform from the origin request if further inform provid by the origin request is satisfactori then thei mai sai it is okai it could be approv then anoth letter of approv will be issu but if thei ar not satisfi by ani further inform or if no further inform concern that request is forthcom in that case that particular request would be either refus or still remain on hold which mean indefinit on hold it could last a month or even year becaus thei ar wait for further inform so for the time be the committe is work in a wai which we try to make the applic simpler and we treat and process those applic in a more effect wai but unfortun becaus of the number of request and also the limit resourc we have and becaus of some of the complic procedur guid our work there is a backlog and we have succeed in cut that backlog to about on and on half month now from three to month at the end of last year so thi is all i want to sai at the veri begin zalatimu i am sure all our distinguish guest ar veri anxiou to ask and comment on what you just said but first we ll move to mr muhammad al jamal director gener of the custom depart becaus as you know the jordanian govern reli heavili on custom for it incom and with the loss of it most signific trade partner that of cours caus some sever financi problem for the depart pleas mr al jamal al jamal thank you the jordan govern ha to implement the sanction committe 661 and to implement that the minist of financ have found an offic privat offic the purpos of thi offic is to receiv the applic of the jordanian export to send good to iraq thi offic have to receiv all hi applic and send it through the minist of foreign affair to our perman ambassador in the un we send these applic to get approv to be sent to export good to iraq we found that most of these applic is not approv we have sent 4 454 applic to the sanction committe we have receiv 718 approv and we have receiv 852 applic refus and still 2 984 applic pend we ar face a lot of problem with the sanction committe in term of time need for approv and the discrimin between jordan applic and other countri applic and between the same commod for exampl we have sent 76 applic for textil thei approv 11 thei refus 41 and still 24 pend zalatimu if i can make just a footnot i think a lot of peopl send you applic and expect that you ar actual the decisionmak bodi on what thei ar allow to export and what thei ar not allow to export when actual in realiti it mr wan s committe which make these decis so al jamal interrupt thank you for the question actual our job in that is just to receiv the applic and send it to the un sanction committe through our ambassador zalatimu so to emphas again you re just a conduit and not a decisionmak bodi so when citizen come to you with complaint that for exampl thei weren t given permiss to export y or z it not actual on your shoulder but on al jamal interrupt no exactli and anoth question we ar face now when i am mention that we ar send 76 applic for textil and we just got 11 approv and that 41 refus those 41 word indistinct why give approv to 11 peopl and you don t give us actual it s not our decis and we send 44 applic for tire we receiv four approv and no approv six and 34 still pend for glass we send nine applic three approv approv on is not approv and five is pend anoth exampl the last on is cloth 38 applic 12 is approv zero not approv and 26 still pend zalatimu sorri to cut you off we re go to move mr tawfiq qa war chairman of the ship agent associ he is essenti jordan s link to the outsid world through it onli port al aqabah and he ha probabl the most sever gripe with these sanction and the impos embargo pleas mr qa war qa war well inspect start in august of 1990 there wa no prearrang at all it wa all haphazardli until march of 1991 when the guidelin set out and then we have kept a record as a ship agent associ we have kept a record and we have been monitor everi ship that wa delai inspect divert or refus entri and in the guidelin two condit were plai down on is that all document must be clear and visibl and that is veri easi to compli with and the second precondit is access ship must have their cargo fulli access and thi is veri difficult to achiev especi in gener cargo thei ar two type convent ship where you have gener cargo and to make all cargo access you have to open corridor and thei keep some stack of cargo here and there so thi is not safe for the ship in it navig nor for the cargo itself contain to have them access i ll give you a veri simpl exampl which explain the difficulti of the situat a ship come from north contin down to the red sea serv al aqabah let s sai we will have around 1 000 contain thi is mainli the red sea express which is the basic line consortium of line serv al aqabah with that area it ha 400 let s sai contain to al aqabah gener and 600 to the other port it cannot come to al aqabah with 1 000 contain to be fulli access logist thi is imposs so the ship ha to go to jeddah first discharg the cargo al hudaydah djibouti port sudan restor al aqabah cargo again leav corridor among the contain come back to al aqabah so that it can be fulli access discharg the contain of al aqabah reload the empti and the export go down to jeddah port sudan saudi come back through the suez canal up north thi round trip cost the ship between 250 to 300 thousand dollar plu the delai that the ship must pass in by daylight come out by daylight all these delai cost monei therefor it is the ship owner who impos a certain inspect search charg which is 500 for a 20 footer and a 1 000 for a 40 footer contain thi goe to the ship owner it doe not go to the unit nation let s make thi veri clear zalatimu would you sai thi is the most difficult period you face as a ship agent qa war exactli ye and i have to continu to give you thi idea about the damag which have been caus jordanian economi from the point of view of extra insur at the begin of the gulf from the delai in inspect from the surcharg that have been impos from the loss of export of iraqi cargo the loss of the import of the jordanian iraqi cargo via al aqabah all thi ha cost the countri accord to our calcul in the vicin about 600 million dinar close to 900 million which is a veri substanti crunch the neg effect on the ship side is that out of 41 regular line that were call at al aqabah 21 have stop some other ar now transship via jeddah with feed servic al aqabah ha lost it posit as a major port in the red sea and ha becom a subsidiari port befor al aqabah wa veri import port for ship owner ship come in let us sai with 10 000 tonn of sugar on complet of thi charg will easili pick up phosphat potash and go out so we were enjoi shipper freight come in shipper freight go out the other loss is the lack of confid by the import and export in their ship or contain come to al aqabah with raw materi afraid that the ship will be divert move their cargo via latakia beirut and tartu last year over a half a million tonn out of 3 million discharg in al aqabah move via those port thi is anoth loss while sit with the american side in septemb 1993 we discuss thi question at length and a suggest came from them sai thi is a veri a cumbersom oper why don t you get an organ like lloyd s independ organ to do thi inspect on land and we jump at thi suggest and we place it with the icc intern chamber of commerc in pari through which we have been complain to the intern world what is happen in al aqabah and keep them inform thei agre to it thei support us with lloyd s and final we reach the lloyd s regist to come in and do the inspect in the port not as report by the radio servic from 5 o clock thi morn that the ship will be inspect in al aqabah we do not want the ship to be inspect in al aqabah becaus we will be back in squar on where ship will not be abl to have their full capac it is essenti that the ship come through the tiran strait in accord with the freedom of navig a condit recogn all over the world with their full capac and the cargo can be discharg in the port it will be inspect in the port area dure the custom clearanc and i think the discuss between the jordan govern and the unit state govern have advanc a lot toward instruct thi job to an internation recogn independ non profit organ call lloyd s regist to do the job and we hope that the ideal solut after three and a half year of agoni and loss it is time that we take stock and the intern commun take stock and look at what is happen in al aqabah the ideal solut sinc jordan is effect compli with the unit nation resolut and not on singl packag can move to iraq unless there is a unit nation inspect certif with it and sinc no cargo can be load at the load port if it is consign to iraq cannot be load and there ha not been on singl packag which ha been caught for iraq therefor we suggest the inspect could be lift entir if thi is not imposs as heard for some reason or anoth then we move over to the inspect of cargo in the port and i think thi will be a veri good propos for the time be and we will fulli support it zalatimu ok thank you sir stai in al aqabah dr al mahasinah who is the director gener of the jordan port corpor i am sure feel a lot of your agoni you two have becom veri good friend i assum in the past few year al mahasinah well as mr qa war mention and as you emphas we becam so much in busi togeth unfortun with thi neg side effect but let me first welcom mr wan in thi panel and thank you for present the whole issu which is realli vital it took it climax yesterdai when hi majesti king husayn call the five ambassador to the royal court and realli express our agoni about thi thing our agoni is express both in statist that my colleagu would mention or state and in principl we feel that all the resolut that mr wan mention 661 and the rest jordan wa not the subject of these resolut in the idea or in principl or in write unfortun in practic it is jordan that is suffer out of these resolut we don t find a reason why i don t find a reason why my cargo should be inspect and scatter all over the world i don t find a reason why the un or ani other agenc or ani other govern would take me as a victim or as an enemi and scatter my cargo all over the world and divert my ship in the year sinc 1990 till 1994 approxim 150 ship were either prevent or delai or not allow to proce to al aqabah gentlemen in term of monei thi is too much that jordan can take our cargo in the port of al aqabah drop in 1989 we us to handl about 20 million tonn a year of export and import we now handl 1993 figur show that we onli handl 11 6 thi is a drop from 1992 which wa 13 3 that mean that the situat is aggrav and i don t find a reason for it neither do i find a solut for it each tonn of cargo make 25 jd which is approxim 32 and plu that is we have truck driver benefit out of that approxim 7 000 8 000 truck ar work to load and unload thi cargo we have agent like mr qa war and hi colleagu the commerci sector and the industri sector all these peopl the revenu not my exact revenu which ar estim with a loss of approxim 200 million to 250 i would presum that thi situat is unbeliev unjustifi veri harm and it caus me that much of disastr consequ in thi regard i don t find a reason that why should thi inspect goe on and i don t find a mandat for it if through the 150 ship that you divert out of enter the gulf of aqaba all the cargo on them came back wa justifi and as mr qa war mention not a singl box wa found destin or bound to baghdad in violat of 661 so why should thi go on zalatimu i think it is import to know also the wai in which ship ar often pirat by the mif the militari intervent forc which i believ ar intend to be a us led group which divert jordanian ship to other port often not know exactli where thei re go to the captain of a ship doesn t exactli know where he is go al mahasinah interrupt let me add to thi and give you an exampl we had an exampl two week ago or dure the past two week a ship came to al aqabah it cargo wa refus it did send the cargo back to suez anoth ship came with the same cargo and then the inspector came to approach the ship at 2 pm thei said ok you wait till next morn next morn thei came on board the ship and thei couldn t inspect it becaus there were some bee on the ship so thei postpon it till he sprai insecticid against the bee and the fli thei came back again and it wa mention that there is not enough light on it zalatimu it s amazingli incred difficult to set a schedul for exampl when the ship ar come or where thei go al mahasinah here i m not talk biologi i m not just mention bee and so on the reason i want to tell you if your legal cargo that you ar wait for in amman is divert or delai becaus there is a bee on the ship that is not a reason that s a veri veri silli reason and that s a harass that is not realli justifi techniqu mr wan mention simplifi but it is not be simplifi in the tiran strait it is not be simplifi for jordan and it economi and surviv zalatimu i guess hi majesti s statement yesterdai underlin the import of thi issu for the jordanian economi and in fact hi majesti link jordan s particip in the peac talk with some sort of eas of the inspect and sanction in al aqabah next we move to the export side of thi equat mr imad al shamma from the chamber of industri is grave affect as jordanian export sir al shamma well thank you veri much sir allow me first just to give you a brief idea about the jordanian industri as a sector and then i ll move on to the effect of what we talk about todai basic we repres as a chamber of industri the industri sector which compris about 18 000 compani and factori and firm and emploi about 110 000 peopl thi is not the first time that the chamber of industri or the jordanian offici rais the issu of the effect of resolut 661 and the embargo or the ship search on al aqabah with offici whether from the unit state or visit deleg we feel as the chamber of industri as jordan as a whole it economi ha been target to a level of impoverish and we feel that jordan as a result of thi secur council ha suffer tremend as mr qa war ha mention and dr al mahasinah we on both side of the coin on the import side and on the export side suffer in the sens that our cost of import ha went up vi a vi that we have to pai about 1 000 extra for everi 40 foot contain that we import and about 500 for 20 foot contain and even on the export side we have lost tremend on the export side becaus we ar pai now about 250 for everi 20 foot contain for export and about 500 for a 40 foot contain to make the problem even wors is find the vessel if i am sai that i don t need to export to iraq and i m look for new market in europ or anywher els if i don t find a vessel to come and pick up my cargo then i cannot export i cannot compet and if i have to pai an extra fee to put my contain on a ship and to be search by the militari forc then that would add to my cost and to my competit as you know the jordanian industri as a whole is of humanitarian need it is not of militari type of industri we ar a convert industri so we do not believ why should we as jordanian industrialist have to keep on convinc the unit nation and the sanction committe that we don t export militari to anywher els in the world and specif to iraq add to that if the un sanction accord to a certain approv it ha grant to a certain product as mr jamal ha mention we do not see the reason why we should everi time we need to export the same product from the same compani to the same market why do we have to keep on ask for the same approv we have mention to mr wan that thi would onli add to hi dilemma and problem becaus it would augment the demand on hi servic and the sanction committe servic wherebi we have to keep on import appli for the same product from the same compani to the same market thi as a whole we feel should be address in a veri crucial manner wherebi we grant a blanket approv for that product for that compani from a certain part of the world especi jordan i have to emphas anoth fact it is that we ar mix two main issu here it is that the sanction is a un resolut while the inspect of the port is done on basi of the militari forc or the alli forc that were there in the gulf crisi and we feel that the two ar part and parcel of the whole crisi the jordanian industri ha suffer tremend mani compani ar close down or reduc their staff and as you see jordan is the hub of democrat it is the hub of stabil thank god to hi you know the vision of hi majesti the king so we feel with thi sanction and the search on our port whether on the import side or in the export side is creat some sort of social instabl and thi can affect not onli jordan it would affect the whole region add on to top of that we know that jordan is go through the peac process now and we believ that you cannot have a stabl peac if the peopl ar poor and if thei ar not happi basic all thi becom to on simpl factor we should have econom prosper to develop our countri in the sens to accommod the peac process or els we cannot compet zalatimu thank you talk about the jordanian consum possibl the most in touch with the jordanian consum in thi panel here thi even is the presid of the jordanian chamber of commerc mr muhammad asfur i m sure you ar particularli interest in comment on mr wan s theme asfur thank you zayd i want to enter into a differ line of direct but simpl question concern the sanction and the sieg on iraq my first question mr wan would be until when is jordan to keep suffer and sacrif the constant of free trade on fals polit ground all my question ar go to be interrel realli and on that pretens how will the region enter a new phase of econom relat while jordan cannot purchas it import for the same price avail to other countri in the region where is the just formula in thi polit agenda and also for my own educ i would like to know doe the unit nation resolut 661 concern the sieg on iraq give the upper hand to the unit state to investig ship load with good or import to jordan is jordan the target will the us realli halt vessel carri american export to jordan in the same wai it stop ani other vessel ship that ha good ship to al aqabah what is the intent there is it to hurt jordan more than it had been hurt as a result of the gulf war ar we try to increas the percentag of unemploy ar we try to increas the percentag of peopl beyond the poverti line what ar we realli try to do within all these sanction and as a result jordan is suffer thank you zalatimu i think we ll keep the we ll keep mr wan s answer to the end first befor we move to mr wan i would like to hear from dr al mumtaz advisor to the minist of financ who s with us todai if you have i m sure you have some comment dr al mumtaz al mumtaz thank you zayd it seem to me that noth is left to me to talk about but i have two comment the first on relat to the mechan of the sanction committe now i think that the mechan is us especi when it come to handl jordan s request to ship good to iraq is veri slow now thi unanim vote of the committe you know when you ar deal with human be you know with send humanitarian good to iraq and you know you leav it to the whim of on person to block ani decis of that committe so again the consensu you have to have consenu is bother me a lot the other thing is limit now limit the period of the you know implement the approv of a certain commod for four month now again peopl ar complain about thi in jordan you know why don t leav it open as it us to be befor now the other point now wherev we go to present our case the whole world now know that we ar abid by the sanction and also everybodi will tell us you know look you know we understand your case we ar veri sympathet but until now no and practic no real support is provid to jordan now we the whole world know that we did take care of the evacue who left iraq and kuwait and we took care of even you know some refuge all over the world and now in a countri like jordan where democraci is flourish we have to take care of the concern of our citizen in jordan now i have a quotat i am quot a report by mr jean ripert who wa then the director gener for develop and intern econom cooper at the unit nation who came here to jordan in octob and he wrote a report in that report i m quot him the secur council should take everi effort to see that these embargo relat loss ar compens in full in order to avoid destabil the economi etc in jordan now i think you know the world commun should listen to us and concern the citizen of jordan i think you know their patienc is run thin and we expect you know the world commun to respond to our concern thank you q awar can i interject here just on on point regard the inspect which is relev to thi as thi stem out from hi majesti s remark and declar is that iraq is abl to import anyth it want from ani port around without the ship call at those port be inspect thi is veri import to be a point focal point zalatimu so i guess actual when the object of the sanction committe is to forbid thing from enter iraq thing ar enter iraq and jordan in the final analysi is pai the price for un impos sanction which have been insensit to jordan s econom and polit and social need al mahasinah other port ar flourish on behalf of our port which is unjustifi plu you must take in consider that the reput that jordan made through the year of be a veri moder countri a countri that believ in intern decis intern committe it respect them all the time now peopl think of jordanian as mayb smuggler contrabandist and everyth is concentr on jordan word indistinct zalatimu in realiti jordan ha becom a model for third world democrat and institution democraci al mahasinah interject as mr al shamma mention it zalatimu i think you have mai be 15 question or so i don t know if you ve had a chanc to look them over and see what chang thought i m sure some of them ar interrel if you d like to begin answer them hate to put you in the hot box but that s the situat here in now wan thank you zalatimu you re welcom wan i can set on the sea i have a lot of difficult question to answer first of all i shall thank you for your statement and your comment the point you rais in your statement ar well taken and i ll certainli can promis you that i ll report your feel the feel of the jordanian peopl and your govern and the busi to the chairman of the secur council committe for consider hopefulli someth could be done in that area but i cannot promis anyth becaus the final decis rest with the 15 member of the committe not with the secretariat from which i am from we ar provid secretari servic to the committe not the polici maker the decisionmak that is the first point i want to make secondli i can see our host my host ha rais a number of veri interest question some ar of a gener natur and some ar more individu let me address some of the question on by on and if i omit anyth or if you have ani further question i m alwai at your dispos person i should sai i am keenli awar of the difficult plight the difficult situat face by jordan becaus from the carri out of the secur council resolut sanction regim sentenc as heard and i can assur you gentlemen that when that question wa brought up to the committe for discuss all the member of the committe express their great sympathi and also all the committe member recogn that jordan had inde been significantli affect by the sanction regim establish and resolut 661 1990 that is a fact i want to convei to you at the same time the committe member thei re also concern with a view of find a wai to address that issu although no consensu ha been reach in that respect i think mr al jamal is right we have receiv thousand of applic from jordanian busi for export of variou commod to iraq and i think i would be right to sai that jordan is on of our chief client or the main client becaus about half of the applic ar from jordan howev the committe ha it own guid line as express in the veri begin that we ar oper on a non object basi which need the consensu of all 15 member to decid upon anyth with regard to some of the point rais by mr al jamal i would like to sai when that question of discrimin wa brought up to the committe for discuss mani member express the idea that the committe wa conduct it busi and is carri out it mandat on a non discriminatori basi consid each applic submit to the committe for it consider and no object procedur on it own merit and without ani focu without focus it attent on the origin of the good involv word indistinct who is the request zalatimu if i could just interject i understand as a recent case of some water purif system someth which jordan appli to export to iraq and i believ the netherland had appli to export the same item and for some reason the export from the netherland wa given permiss and the on from jordan wa not i do not know if you ar awar of thi most recent occurr wan i m well awar of that i just want to give you gentlemen some explan how we work i m not comment on ani of the comment of member individu member state hi excel the prime minist of jordan when he visit new york he present a statement to the committe and he also rais that exampl you rais it s true that the committe did approv a request from netherland for if my memori is right about 2 000 tonn of chemic materi for water treatment premis at the same time we have receiv dozen of request along that line most of them ar either reject or put on hold and that is a case which ha been approv becaus some member can see thei includ or thei have enough inform about the end us and end user and other relev inform concern the issu that wa approv inde in the case of jordanian applic we receiv a number of them most of them ar still shelv on hold not reject outright becaus the committe member some of them at least ar wish to have further inform concern the request that explain why you see there could be similar request but becaus of the abund or the absenc of further inform regard certain aspect of the request that also affect the decis of some member zalatimu if my memori serv me correctli i believ thi particular incid i believ you sir resubmit the applic provid full detail i mean the applic of netherland and the applic of jordan were almost ident in the inform thei contain and yet you know the outcom wa to grant permiss to netherland wan ye inde sometim you mai provid further inform in that regard but it s up to the judgment of member to decid whether thei ar satisfactori or not that s why i would sai although thei re of a similar or ident natur the applic but becaus of the inform pertain to the good contain in that request that ar realli matter sometim of crucial import to determin whether that applic met with the approv of the committe zalatimu it seem to me that come down to a technic i mean what seem to me to be more import than some technic in an applic is the fact that jordan ha suffer greatli becaus of the sanction and the embargo impos on iraq and that seem to be much more import than you know a few miss word in an applic and it seem that the committe should consid the fact and the posit of the jordanian economi vi a vi thi crisi and not deni applic on the basi of you minor technic i mean it is veri hard for us as jordanian to understand why we ar not given permiss to export as you sai base on the technic wan i ll certainli convei what you said to the committe member what i want to stress in thi respect is that if the request provid enough inform regard that particular request thei have a better chanc to be consid by the committe that s why when the chairman wrote to the perman repres of jordan to the unit nation he said that it would be a greatli help if fulli detail inform about the relev product and end user and the gener circumst relat to the export is includ on the applic form when it is initi submit for the consider of the committe zalatimu thank you gentlemen and good even

year to servic in the navi and as a particip of two war ye and by mani of my colleagu obvious we need to perceiv what aa kokoshin said as the view of the ministri of defens leadership on our navi s present and futur in my opinion the main thing in the interview wa the present of the mission that the navi must be readi to accomplish for the purpos of russia s secur and defens it appear to us that the mission were correctli set forth and inde we would like for them to have been word not in such gener term but in more specif term howev there is someth contain in aa kokoshin s respons that put us on guard i wa especi concern by aa kokoshin s statement i would not sai that we have a new shipbuild program in it tradit sens i think that there must be a weapon develop program on the whole where the navi will be a compon it s obviou that the understand of thi compon wa engend by an underestim of the navi s role in the system of defens and protect of russia s interest under contemporari condit it complex and essenc thi is confirm by other statement due to our geostrateg posit we tradition ar more a land than a naval power ye and russia s militari fate as a rule ha been decid on land the reason why adequ attent is not be devot to the navi in the current militari doctrin is certainli contain in these two quot i don t know if it is worth repeat that russia s maritim border is approxim 40 000 kilomet which is more than two time it land border and more than the coast line of all of europ and we also need to protect and when necessari defend thi border or recal the rapidli increas signific of the continent shelf maritim econom zone etc the protect of which is becom a veri import mission just like ensur safeti of navig and fish consequ the statement that russia is more a land than a naval power is not onli groundless but also contain a distort of russia s geostrateg posit and a disparag of our navi s role we can agre with the fact that russia s militari fate as a rule ha been decid on land but we must not forget that in all war the navi wa not onli the armi s loyal assist but also an activ particip of mani joint with ground troop and aviat battl for the sake of victori to disparag the navi s role and signific mean to cancel out it 300 year histori and to forget it achiev under the leadership of peter i spiridov ushakov senyavin lazarev nakhimov essen

secur council s militari committe and is attempt to resolv emerg conflict situat us arm and sometim even outsid the bloc s zone and without take into account the opinion of the member of the un secur council itself therefor it is extrem rash to assert that there is no threat if not of war than of the emerg of arm conflict into which russia and the other ci countri could be drawn at the same time the experi of all of the latest most seriou conflict point toward an increas of the signific of the oper of aviat and naval forc in them which attest to the increas of the danger precis from the maritim ax in an articl publish in nezavisimaya gazeta on 8 februari 1994 the author critic our militari doctrin becaus it doe not indic a specif enemi against whom we ar creat the arm forc but do we need to repeat previou error in my view we must not seek specif enemi but build the arm forc from the calcul that thei could appear from ani direct and becaus we must put a stop to ani infring on the sovereignti and integr of russia and the ci countri we must be readi to accomplish that mission becaus it is simpli imposs to restructur anyth especi the navi in a short period of time proceed from what ha been state abov in my opinion it is advis to word our navi s mission as follow 1 ensur the secur of russia and the ci countri from the naval ax in my view we must consid the primari danger to be strike by sea launch long rang cruis missil the platform of which ar surfac combat and submarin todai thi is the tomahawk sea launch long rang cruis missil with a launch rang of approxim 3 000 kilomet thi permit them to destroi target locat on the european territori of russia to the ural all target in belorussia belaru ukrain moldova north caucasu and central asia dure launch from the barent norwegian and mediterranean sea from the north atlant and even from the indian ocean from the area of the sea of japan sea of okhotsk and the pacif ocean all target of russia to the irkutsk meridian carrier base and strateg aviat ar anoth danger from the maritim ax we can compar the destruct radiu of carrier base aircraft especi with the util of airfield of contigu state upon their return with the launch rang of sea launch long rang cruis missil and even strateg aviat the most effect weapon to repel sea launch long rang cruis missil and carrier base aviat strike is to bring

hasten to add that hi own music wa intend to have entertain valu so did mozart and ravel acknowledg it as well as all the great compos did until these self appoint guardian of theori came into exist

label in the past picasso probabl didn t like be call a cubist simpli becaus it unfairli limit hi ident but the word minim is emin mockabl how mani time do we hear the standard snipe minim music for

not be a standard bearer for anyon but himself inde it is onli with much cajol that he address the minimalist and other who he sai have noth new to sai philip glass for instanc what he write is childish babbl it us the most superfici aspect of an old music languag peopl do not come out of the hall hum it becaus it s appli to visual event and doesn t stand alon it s music for peopl who hate music and can onli be look at histor as a reaction to the misunderstood 12 tone system which creat problem both for audienc and compos but sure those old harmon relationship brahm and beethoven can find better mean of preserv than the bare bone formula devis by the minimalist perl who in hi earli research into the first 12 tone music found hi composit nich ha brought that 20th centuri languag to a comfort integr place on place him in what he call the mainstream whether that mainstream ha 1 000 or 1 000 000 listen swim in it though is immateri my approach is not concern with popular he sai conced minim s fascin for the mass number mean noth to me i m not count he goe on to describ hi pleasur over the world premier of hi window of order present by the juilliard string quartet in april in washington s librari of congress it wa a beethoven crowd that fill the hall peopl with a sincer and develop love for music but if someon told me i could exchang thi for a stadium mob of 10 000 i

own success thei appeal to trend seeker and set themselv up as arbit of trendi who is truli on the side of the public i think i am not becaus i m a nice gui or want to be popular but becaus my music ha integr the 12 tone languag into someth access there s a differ between the complex and the complic mozart wa complex and so is our spoken languag with it elabor grammar but some serial music is onli complic by that i mean artifici not relev peopl think i m more human than boulez for exampl which is hardli the point my music is simpli more coher than hi minim is not the onli thing i dislik although some of it practition like adam ar more palat than other quot hundr of bar of mozart georg rochberg doe thi hardli count as new music and borrow a dead languag the wai david del tredici doe is no better i don t want to get person but these compos gain no more of my sympathi than the glass of the world as for minim i think it will grind itself out of exist but someth just as bad will take it place david del tredici good minimalist music will bring audienc back david del tredici at 52 rememb have john adam as a student in hi music theori class at harvard he s also good friend with
