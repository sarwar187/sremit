percent with an 18 month complianc period anoth comment state that fda cost estim of 20 million repres 1 percent of industri sale but a much larger percentag of industri profit the comment explain that extend the complianc period would reduc the cost of complianc and therefor minim ani reduct in profit on comment request a delai becaus there will be addit cost for complianc with the upcom unit state pharmacopoeia usp standard the comment state that resourc could be better spent if these complianc effort were complet concurr rather than consecut on comment request a delai becaus of the overlap with the final month of the extend period that wa allow for food in convent food form the comment report that mani convent food manufactur and their label supplier ar rush to produc final label for such food the comment said that supplement manufactur will not be abl to secur revis label for their product from label manufactur in time to meet a 6 month deadlin becaus of the competit for label manufactur resourc the agenc agre that it will be difficult for dietari supplement manufactur to compli within 6 month especi in light of the fact that label supplier ar current stress with label order from manufactur of food in convent food form who ar attempt to meet the mai 1994 deadlin for compli with the 1990 amend the agenc also agre that an extens of the date of applic would result in signific save for the industri administr cost print cost and label inventori dispos cost ar all depend on the length of the complianc period the agenc ha determin that the cost of the regul

58 fr 2070 at 2075 the agenc note that the cost of complianc for manufactur of food in convent food form repres less than 1 percent of sale the cost of complianc with a 6 month complianc period for dietari supplement is approxim 2 percent of sale therefor if the agenc doe not extend the date of applic for dietari supplement manufactur that segment of the food industri will be ask to bear higher rel cost than the agenc determin were reason for food in convent food form for all these reason the agenc determin that the congression mandat date of applic will result in an undu econom hardship for dietari supplement manufactur b the agenc s determin of a date of applic of section 403 q and r 2 of the act as appli to dietari supplement the agenc ha determin that undu econom hardship will result if the dietari supplement industri is requir to compli with section 403 q and r of the act within 6 month as will be shown in the follow discuss on the econom impact a 6 month delai total of 12 month to compli in the applic of section 403 q and r 2 to dietari supplement would result in over 40 percent save of complianc cost and a 12 month delai total of 18 month to compli would result in over 50 percent save given the larg dispar in cost of complianc for manufactur of dietari supplement if thei ar requir to compli in 6 month as compar to those that ar be born by manufactur of food in convent form fda find that it should tailor the delai to reduc the cost for dietari supplement manufactur and thu to minim the dispar therefor the agenc conclud that it is appropri to delai the applic date for dietari supplement for 12 month as it did for food in convent food form thu the agenc intend to appli section 403 q and r 2 to food label after juli 1 1995 the agenc fulli expect that some dietari supplement firm will be abl to compli befor thi date onc the pressur on print label for food in convent food form is eas after mai 8 1994 therefor consum can expect to begin enjoi the health benefit of the label chang prior to juli 1 1995 iii econom impact some comment agre with the agenc s estim of the cost of relabel mani comment were direct at issu cover by the advanc notic of propos rulemak anprm which address the safe us of dietari supplement 58 fr 33690 june 18 1993 sever comment state that the three propos that the agenc issu there wa a propos rule on health claim 58 fr 33700 in addit

consid a major rule under execut order 12291 the agenc disagre execut order 12291 did not appli to advanc notic therefor no analysi of that document wa requir by that execut order fda ha not taken ani action with respect to the anprm that would make it subject to execut order 12866 the three propos ar concern with the label of dietari supplement while the anprm is concern with other issu thu the

includ amino acid herbal product and other dietari supplement that have no recogniz food function in it analysi of the propos fda state that there could be as mani as 25 000 product that could be consid to be dietari supplement the agenc reduc that number to 5 000 an estim of the number of vitamin and miner supplement product becaus 1 mani product that contain herb or other similar nutrit substanc would not be subject to the nutrit label requir becaus thei do not contain the nutrient that must be declar and 2 some product market as dietari supplement would be unaffect by the 1990 amend becaus thei bear drug claim that make them subject to the drug provis of the act for these reason it is clear that not all 25 000 product would be requir to be test or relabel in respons to the regul implement the 1990 amend howev fda is convinc by the comment that some herbal product and other dietari supplement might need to be test and relabel as a result of these regul fda is unabl to determin exactli how mani of those product would be cover by the food provis of the act rather than by the drug provis therefor the agenc s final analysi of the rule is base on a rang of product between 5 000

suggest that there ar a minimum of 150 herb compani alon the agenc ha confirm that the electron yellow page cover both public and privat organ of all type and size the agenc admit that the electron yellow page is not a perfect sourc for the number of firm but fda believ that it is not entir inadequ the major differ between the agenc s estim and those of the comment is the inclus or exclus of manufactur herbal product and product contain other similar nutrit substanc as state in the respons to the previou comment the agenc ha determin that at least some of these type of dietari supplement product mai be subject to the nutrit label provis howev becaus mani of these product do not contain signific amount of nutrient mani manufactur will not be face with the necess of relabel their product for these reason the agenc believ that it estim of the number of firm mai be low but that to includ all herbal product manufactur and manufactur of other similar nutrit substanc would inflat the estim howev the agenc ha no basi on which to arriv at the actual number of firm therefor in it final analysi the agenc is estim the total number of firm affect to be between 150 and 300 b cost 3 sever comment disagre with the agenc s estim of administr cost the comment state that actual administr expens would be at least 1 000 per label administr expens accord to the comment ar associ with

broad and there were no identifi pattern to the estim given although fda acknowledg that it assumpt mai have result in underestim the comment did not provid enough detail inform to permit fda to evalu the administr cost estim that thei submit therefor the agenc is not alter it origin estim base on these comment the agenc ha determin that total administr cost for a 6 month complianc period ar between 130 000 and 250 000 depend on the exact number of firm affect by the regul as determin by the contractor s studi ref 1 administr cost ar lower with longer complianc period a 1 year complianc period result in administr cost of between 65 000 and 125 000 an 18 month complianc period result in administr cost of between 50 000 and 94 000 4 on comment state that the requir that herbal dietari supplement be requir to bear nutrit label would mandat that all herbal product be assai for their nutrient content the comment further explain that test for 12 nutrient would cost 588 per product for a total of 15 million for 25 000 product the agenc agre that to the extent that herbal product manufactur will provid nutrit label herbal product will need to be assai for their nutrient content the agenc note howev that mani herb do not contain signific amount of the nutrient that must be list in the nutrit label and that thi fact is determin from refer work without test thu these herb will not need to be test mani comment admit that in gener herbal product do not contain signific amount of nutrient and ar not consum for their nutrient content howev some herbal product and combin product will requir nutrient test in the propos the agenc assum that dietari supplement of vitamin and miner will not undergo ani addit test as a result of the nutrit label requir comment did not object to

or between 15 million and 75 million accord to the rti studi the length of the complianc period determin a firm s abil to combin plan label chang with mandat chang therefor increment label and redesign activ ar less costli with lengthier complianc period if the agenc extend the complianc period by onli 6 month print and redesign cost would be between 7 5 million and 37 5 million the 1 year extens that the agenc is provid will reduc print and redesign cost to between 6 million and 28 million 6 sever comment provid data on label inventori that would be subject to dispos these comment state that a 4 to 6 month suppli of product label is common result in 3 4 million to 5 1 million of label inventori that will be discard anoth comment suggest that it dietari supplement label and box inventori dispos cost would be 325 000 with a 6 month complianc period 200 000 with a 1 year complianc period and 50 000 with an 18 month complianc period on comment estim the cost of discard

be between 3 million and 13 million the 18 month complianc period that the agenc is provid will result in cost of between 2 million and 9 million 7 sever comment disagre with the agenc s estim of the cost of inventori dispos the comment argu that firm would dispos of finish product in addit to label the comment state that typic product cost for dietari supplement would result in an inventori valu for the dispos of 5 000 product of between 48 million and 73 million on firm estim it own cost of discard noncompli inventori would be approxim 30 percent of finish good inventori or about 45 000 becaus these propos cover onli the label of dietari supplement the agenc doe not agre that there would be ani reason for firm to dispos of ani product inventori nor did the comment provid an explan as to why it would be necessari to do so moreov ani product packag and label in accord with law befor the date that fda begin to appli the section 403 q and r of the act will not need to be relabel therefor the agenc is not chang it estim base on thi comment 8 sever comment argu that the agenc fail to consid the cost of discard and redesign catalog product literatur and advertis the comment

product and appli for full credit at 48 million ani product label befor the applic date will not need to compli with the new nutrit label and nutrient content claim provis therefor no product that is label in accord with law befor juli 1 1995 need be return relabel or destroi as a result of these new provis howev fda agre that to the extent that product is return the cost of dispos of product return from retail becaus of old label should be consid a cost of these regul howev the agenc is unpersuad of the magnitud of the cost and is unsur of the extent to which old product will be return the comment provid insuffici inform with which the agenc could estim these cost therefor the agenc is not chang it estim base on thi comment 10 sever comment express concern that the rule mai caus the

distinguish from drug claim or structur function claim therefor the agenc ha no basi to find that these regul will caus the problem describ in these comment the agenc believ that there is everi reason to expect that the continu market of the vast major of dietari supplement product will be unaffect by these regul 11 in the analysi of the propos rule the agenc recogn that the rule could have an advers impact on small busi most of the cost associ with label regul ar fix cost which ar typic more burdensom for small firm than for larg firm becaus of the smaller sale base on which to spread cost

believ that limit the us of claim on label or label will be of limit effect in prevent consum from purchas supplement that thei erron believ will prevent seriou ill howev these regul will ensur that the label of dietari supplement will provid full nutrit label to help consum to maintain healthi dietari practic and thei will help to ensur that ani nutrient content or health claim made in the label of these product ar scientif valid truth and not mislead for these reason these regul will provid a signific benefit 14 some comment state that the cost of provid nutrit inform on the label of dietari supplement of herb would greatli outweigh ani clear public benefit the comment explain that herb do not contain signific amount of the core nutrient and ar not normal consum for their nutrit valu therefor the valu to consum of includ nutrit label on herb product is insignific the agenc agre with thi comment howev the agenc note that those product that do not contain signific amount of the 14

particularli those in the na recommend dietari allow i e chlorid chromium fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium and vitamin k the comment point out that advanc in scientif knowledg have shown that these nutrient ar consid essenti to human health some comment also suggest list nutrient such as arsen boron silicon tin and vanadium that thei state ar of major signific in human nutrit some of these comment suggest that an asterisk in the percent daili valu column could refer to a footnot such as no daili valu ha been establish for thi nutrient anoth comment suggest that these addit nutrient could be list in a subsect of the nutrit panel below the bar after the last nutrient for which there is an rdi or drv on comment state that to put inform on nutrient of thi type outsid of the nutrit fact box would be inconveni and mai caus some consum to overlook the presenc of these addit nutrient some of which should not be consum in excess the agenc is persuad that it is appropri to allow the nutrient that ar list as be essenti to human in the na recommend dietari allow ref 2 and 10 but for which fda ha not establish rdi to be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when thei ar present in supplement at more than insignific amount the agenc agre that there have been signific advanc in scientif knowledg with respect to essenti nutrient requir sinc 1968 in 1989 the na updat it rda to includ valu for vitamin k and selenium and to make signific revis in the allow for sever nutrient includ vitamin b6 folat folic acid vitamin b12 magnesium iron and zinc ref

fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium and vitamin k the establish of rdi would have allow these nutrient to be list on the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner as well of food in convent food form howev as state abov section 203 of the ds act instruct fda not to promulg regul that requir the us of or that ar base upon recommend daili allow of vitamin or miner befor novemb 8 1993 other than those specifi in 101 9 c 7 iv as in effect on octob 6 1992 in accord with thi provis of the ds act the agenc issu a final rule on januari 6 1993 58 fr 2206 that retain the former us rda valu as a result the final rule did not includ rdi for chlorid chromium fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium and vitamin k becaus the prohibit in section 203 of the ds act ha now expir the agenc is propos elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist to establish rdi valu for those nutrient list by the na as be essenti to human and that do not alreadi have rdi valu the agenc is propos thi action becaus these nutrient ar essenti for the mainten of good health in human in recognit of the essenti of these nutrient and in respons to the comment summar abov the agenc is requir in new 101 36 b 3 that chlorid chromium fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium and vitamin k be includ in the nutrit label when present in the dietari supplement the agenc also is provid in 101 36 b 4 vi that if ani of these nutrient ar declar thei ar to be follow by an asterisk in the percent daili valu column the asterisk is to refer to anoth asterisk that is place at the bottom of the tabl and that is follow by the statement daili valu not establish thi action is a logic outgrowth of the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement becaus that propos put into issu the question of whether the list of nutrient that fda propos be includ in the nutrit label under 101 36 wa the appropri list the comment have persuad fda that the list need to be expand in the manner describ in thi final rule fda is not persuad howev that other trace element for which the na ha not establish rda or esaddi should be declar within the nutrit label the comment that suggest that such element be includ on the label provid some publish report that certain of these element have been found to be essenti in the diet of variou anim but did not provid suffici evid for the agenc to conclud that there is scientif consensu about their essenti for the mainten of good health in human the agenc strongli believ that evid of the us of a nutrient for human is necessari befor that nutrient can be allow to be list within the nutrit label thi polici is consist with current 101 9 i 5 redesign and revis in the januari 6 1993 final rule as 101 9 k 5 which prohibit a food s label from state or impli that the food ha special dietari properti becaus of the presenc of a substanc when in fact the us of the substanc ha not been establish in human nutrit in addit in it propos rule on mandatori nutrit label 55 fr 29487 at 29493 juli 19 1990 fda state that it wa concern about the possibl of a larg number of nutrient be list in nutrit label and about the wai in which their presenc on the label mai be interpret by consum fda express concern that the presenc of a larg number of nutrient could be misinterpret as impli that a food ha a greater public health signific than mai be the case the potenti for thi happen and mislead the consum about the contribut of the food to human nutrit is especi like if the nutrit label were to includ nutrient not known to be import to human therefor fda believ that food that list such nutrient in the nutrit label would be misbrand under section 403 a of the act which prohibit mislead inform on the label and label of food howev statement about amount and percentag can be made outsid of the nutrit label as discuss in the final rule on nutrient content claim publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist the agenc is specifi that the new nutrient to be list appear in an order that reflect the order that fda propos in the nutrit label propos of novemb 27 1991 56 fr 60390 vitamin k is to be list after vitamin e with the fat solubl vitamin selenium is to be list befor copper and the remain nutrient manganes fluorid chromium molybdenum and chlorid ar to be list after copper at the bottom of the list the agenc point out that it is not allow the list of these nutrient on the nutrit label of food in convent food form under 101 9 c 8 quantit amount by weight of vitamin and miner ar not list within the nutrit label of food in convent food form as a result the list of onli an asterisk in conjunct with the statement daili valu not establish would provid consum with no indic of the amount of chlorid chromium fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium and vitamin k present in the food therefor fda ha not provid in 101 9 for a provis compar to that in 101 36 b 3 and b 4 that allow for the placement of these nutrient on the nutrit label fda wish to point out that 101 36 a onli requir the label of a dietari supplement of a vitamin or miner to bear nutrit label in accord with the provis of 101 36 if the vitamin or miner in the supplement have an rdi or drv accordingli dietari supplement contain onli chlorid chromium fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium or vitamin k need not adher to 101 36 until such time as rdi ar establish for them 2 a coupl of comment said that nutrient such as fat and sodium should not be requir to be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner on of these comment said that dietari supplement ar not taken becaus of their fat or sodium level and that these substanc should not be declar other comment specif support the propos rule in requir that nutrient of thi type be declar when thei ar present the agenc is not persuad that nutrient such as fat and sodium should not be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when present in signific amount the major of the comment support fda view that thi inform is need to fulli inform consum of the nutrient content of these product although dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar not consum becaus of their fat or sodium level thi type of inform on product that contain signific level of such nutrient will assist consum in maintain healthi dietari practic therefor the agenc is not make the request chang in the regul 3 a few comment state that dietari supplement of herb and of other nutrit substanc should be label under 101 36 on of these comment said it would be less confus if all supplement were label in the same manner other comment agre that dietari supplement of herb should be label in accord with 101 9 for food in convent food form howev at least on comment request that dietari supplement of herb be exempt from declar the core nutrient if thei have to be label in accord with 101 9 and anoth comment said that these dietari supplement should not have to list percent daili valu at least on comment state that dietari supplement of herb should have their own format for nutrit label and a few other comment request that dietari supplement of herb be exempt from all nutrit label on of these comment agre that fda did not have the author to exempt dietari supplement of herb from 101 9 and want an amend to the 1990 amend that would exempt these dietari supplement from nutrit label thi comment said that dietari supplement of herb ar not normal consum for their nutrit valu and that nutrit label on these product is irrelev and unimport to consum as explain in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33716 june 18 1993 the differ in the label of dietari supplement of vitamin or miner and of dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc is a result of section 403 q 5 f of the act as state abov thi section provid that if a food to which section 411 of the act appli i e a dietari supplement of vitamin or miner contain on or more of the nutrient requir to be list in nutrit label the label or label of such food is to compli with the requir of section 403 q 1 and q 2 of the act in a manner that fda determin by regul is appropri for such food other dietari supplement ar not subject to section 403 q 5 f of the act and thu ar subject to regul under section 403 q of the act in the same manner as ani other food there is noth in the 1990 amend or elsewher in the act that would allow the agenc to exempt the broad categori of dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc from section 403 q 1 and q 2 of the act thu supplement that ar not dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar appropri subject to nutrit label under 101 9 under 101 9 the nutrit label of dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc mai be present in either a full or simplifi format as specifi in 101 9 d or f the simplifi format in 101 9 f mai be us when a supplement of herb or of other similar nutrit substanc contain insignific amount of seven or more of the follow nutrient calori total fat satur fat cholesterol sodium total carbohydr dietari fiber sugar protein vitamin a vitamin c calcium and iron fda is not persuad that nutrit label on dietari supplement of herb us the simplifi format should be exempt from the requir to declar the core nutrient i e calori total fat sodium total carbohydr and protein the agenc ha state it belief in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2142 that thi core inform is essenti to aid consum in learn about the rel nutrit qualiti of all food and the inform allow consum to judg the consequ of the food select thei make no new inform wa present in the comment to chang fda posit on thi issu the agenc also advis that 101 9 j 4 provid that food subject to 101 9 includ dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc ar exempt from nutrit label requir when all of the nutrient requir to be declar under 101 9 c ar absent or ar present in insignific amount fda is also not persuad that nutrit label on supplement of herb should be excus from list percent daili valu as call for in section 2 b 1 a of the 1990 amend a primari purpos of the nutrit label is to help consum make inform food choic by enabl them to both comprehend the nutrit valu of the food and to understand it rel signific in the context of the total daili diet the consum research that the agenc review in the mandatori nutrit label final rule support fda assert that the list of percent daili valu improv consum abil to make correct dietari judgment about a food in the context of a total daili diet 58 fr 2079 at 2125 in part thi improv abil to make judgment is achiev by the us of a consist system of percentag so that virtual all the nutrient on the label can be declar in equival unit also the percentag commun inform about the nutrient level in a food without the consum have to be concern about the absolut level or unit of the underli scale be us therefor for the reason state the agenc ha not acced to the request that dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc be label under 101 36 have their own format for nutrit label be exempt from all nutrit label or be exempt from declar the core nutrient and the percent daili valu in 101 9 4 on comment request that the languag of 101 36 a and 101 9 j 6 be revis to refer to dietari supplement that ar repres as a sourc of vitamin and miner instead of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner thi comment wa concern that alfalfa tablet that have calcium as a binder would be requir to be label under 101 36 the agenc would like to make clear that it doe not consid a product that contain a substanc that is a vitamin or a miner but that is us in the food sole for technolog purpos to be a dietari supplement of a vitamin or miner becaus of the presenc of that substanc in these circumst the product would not be repres as suppli a vitamin or miner see section 411 c of the act thu alfalfa tablet that have calcium as a binder would be requir to be label under 101 9 5 a few comment request clarif of the type of nutrit label that would be requir for combin product that contain herb with ad vitamin the agenc advis that the type of nutrit label that would be requir for product that contain herb and ad vitamin would depend upon the content of the product as well as how the product is repres if a combin product is primarili a dietari supplement of vitamin and miner and is market as such the product would have to be label in accord with 101 36 if the product is not primarili a dietari supplement of vitamin or miner and is not repres as such it would have to be label in accord with 101 9 the agenc believ that the manufactur make the determin as to whether a product is primarili a dietari supplement of an herb of vitamin or miner or of a similar nutrit substanc base on how it label and formul the product the type of claim that ar made on a dietari supplement will both determin and be limit by whether it is a dietari supplement of vitamin or miner or of herb or of other nutrit substanc section 411 b 2 b of the act state that the label and advertis for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner mai not give promin to or emphas ingredi that ar not vitamin miner or repres as a sourc of vitamin or miner thu if for exampl a dietari supplement of an herbal extract add vitamin and miner yet remain primarili a dietari supplement of the herbal extract and is advertis as such section 411 b 2 b of the act would not appli to the product thi would be the case when the label of such a product made no refer to ani ad vitamin or miner other than in the ingredi list and nutrit label section 411 b 2 b is discuss in more detail in the companion document on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement which is publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist 6 on comment request that the languag of 101 36 a be revis to delet and label the comment sai that nutrit label is not requir on label under 101 9 the agenc agre with thi comment and is revis the first sentenc of 101 36 a to delet the word and label therebi requir that the requir nutrit inform appear on the label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner fda note that 101 9 a 2 allow the requir nutrit inform to be place on label of food in convent food form when such food ar not in packag form the type of label that ar identifi in 101 9 a 2 and that allow the requir inform to be clearli displai at the point of purchas ar counter card sign tag affix to the product booklet looseleaf binder and other appropri devic the onli manner in which the agenc envis that dietari supplement of vitamin and miner would not be sold in packag form is when thei would be sold directli from bulk contain if and when dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar sold in thi manner 101 36 g specif provid that thei ar subject to the special label provis in 101 9 j 16 for food sold from bulk contain section 101 9 j 16 allow for the requir nutrit inform to be displai to consum either on the label of the bulk contain plainli in view or in accord with 101 9 a 2 iii nutrit label of dietari supplement a serv size inform 7 at least on comment state that inform on serv size is not need becaus it is given in the direct for us other comment support the propos rule state that serv size inform should be declar in the nutrit label the agenc believ that inform on serv size is as essenti on the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner as it is on that of food in convent food form first thi inform mai not be given in the direct for instanc the direct mai state take 3 tablet a dai without indic if thei ar to be taken at on set as on serv or spread out throughout the dai in three separ serv thu it is fair to conclud that in mani instanc the serv size will not be duplic addition thi inform quickli inform the consum about the amount of the product that contain the level of nutrient declar it also provid a degre of consist between the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner and those of food in convent food form fda conclud in the mandatori nutrit label final rule that if the nutrit label wa to be readili observ and comprehens it must be present in as consist a manner as possibl from label to label 58 fr 2079 at 2136 and 2139 thi consist look to the requir nutrit inform on packag of both dietari supplement of vitamin and miner and food in convent food form will help consum to find and recogn the inform consist treatment is import for the effect us of the nutrit label by consum as a result the agenc is not chang 101 36 to delet the requir for serv size inform 8 on comment state that the refer amount for dietari supplement should be specifi in absolut term but did not provid ani data the comment argu that absolut amount ar need so that if compar claim ar made on product recommend consumpt of for exampl on tablespoon per dai is not compar to a product recommend five tablespoon per dai a few other comment support the propos definit for refer amount the agenc ha defin the refer amount customarili consum for a dietari supplement in 101 12 b as the maximum amount recommend on the label for consumpt per eat occas or in the absenc of recommend on tablet capsul packet or teaspoon as appropri as discuss in the nutrit label propos on dietari supplement 54 fr 33715 at 33716 the agenc reli upon label recommend in thi definit becaus it believ that consumpt is determin in larg part by the amount recommend on the label of these product and it lack the data to specifi absolut amount the agenc request comment on thi approach in the propos no comment provid data for the agenc to us in determin absolut amount that could be us as refer amount therefor the refer amount for dietari supplement will continu to be base on label recommend the agenc doe not agre with the comment that absolut amount ar need to prevent a product with a 1 tablespoon serv from be compar to a product with a 5 tablespoon serv lack data to the contrari the agenc must assum that the recommend amount on the label is the amount customarili consum base on that assumpt it is consist with 101 13 gener principl for nutrient content claim which provid for compar claim to be base on refer amount customarili consum thi topic as it relat to compar claim is further discuss in the companion document on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist 9 a few comment state that the term serv size is confus on dietari supplement a few comment had question about the determin of serv size and on of these comment request that the term recommend intak be us instead of the term serv size anoth comment suggest that the term minimum recommend serv size be us when the label direct specifi a rang of possibl intak for a product e g two to three tablet per dai thi comment wa concern that someon read onli the nutrit inform portion of the label will think that the serv amount list there is the recommend amount when it is realli the maximum recommend amount other comment disagre with thi posit and support the propos rule which state that the serv size should refer to the maximum amount when a rang is specifi for a product on comment ask what the serv size is when the label recommend on to four tablet per dai thi comment also ask about serv size when the label recommend two tablet a dai anoth comment support the statement in the propos that if there is no amount recommend on the label the serv size is on unit of the supplement thi comment observ that the issu aris as to how a determin can be made of serv per contain if there is no recommend as to serv size the comment state that thi issu need to be consid to avoid a regulatori gap the agenc is not persuad that a term other than serv size should be us to describ the basi for nutrient declar for dietari supplement it would be confus for consum if dietari supplement of vitamin and miner us a term such as recommend intak and other food us the term serv size as discuss in the nutrit label propos on dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33716 the agenc propos that the nutrit label of vitamin or miner supplement be present in a manner that is as similar as possibl to the nutrit label of other food the agenc believ that us of the same term on all label will help to avoid confus as us of the new nutrit label becom more widespread and consum becom familiar with it thei will come to understand that the serv size repres the amount of product that thei ar like to consum in on eat occas thu thei will come to understand that for a dietari supplement the serv size repres the amount of that product that thei ar like to consum at those time that thei decid to take the supplement as explain in the propos of june 18 1993 58 fr 33715 at 33716 the agenc believ that it is more us for consum to have the serv size be base on the maximum amount recommend and to have the nutrit inform be report on thi basi than to have serv size be base on the minimum or the averag amount howev in some case the serv size is the same regardless of whether the maximum or minimum amount is us for exampl if label direct recommend a rang of on to three tablet per dai the serv size is on tablet base on the fact that there ar three separ eat occas per dai if label direct recommend a rang of on to four tablet per dai the serv size is also on tablet given the round rule i e four divid by three round off to on as for the question what is the serv size if the label recommend two tablet per dai the serv size would also be on tablet becaus of round in the absenc of recommend on the label a serv size of on unit is appropri for determin the serv size and the serv per contain when the serv is on unit the number of serv per contain would duplic the number of unit declar on the princip displai panel to avoid redund the agenc is provid in 101 36 b 2 as propos that inform on serv per contain need not be provid when the ident inform is state in the net quantiti of content declar howev dietari supplement in liquid or powder form will have to declar serv per contain becaus the net quantiti of content inform will be report in net volum or net weight measur such as fluid ounc or gram g while the serv size will be express in common household measur such as teaspoon in conclus the agenc ha reexamin the propos rule with respect to these comment on serv size and believ that no chang ar need b amount per serv 10 a few comment state that nutrit inform should not be report on the basi of per serv these comment request that the head amount per serv be replac by the term amount per dai or by the term amount per tablet or each tablet contain the agenc doe not agre with the comment that nutrit inform should be report as amount per dai as explain in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33717 the agenc propos in the novemb 27 1991 document 56 fr 60366 at 60383 that nutrit inform be present under the head of per unit but that when label direct specifi that more than on unit be consum dure a dai it also be present under the head of per dai i e dual declar the agenc propos dual declar when more than on unit wa to be consum per dai to more fulli inform consum the agenc receiv a number of comment oppos the dual declar of nutrit inform on supplement some of these comment support declar on the basi of per dai becaus thei believ that it is the total daili amount of nutrient that is import other comment favor a per unit basi becaus some consum mai deviat from the recommend intak or the intak mai be present as a rang in the preambl of the mandatori nutrit label final rule of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2079 at 2168 the agenc state that dual declar mai creat a readabl problem for consum and that in gener a per unit approach wa more us than a per dai approach in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33717 howev the agenc took a differ approach it state that it had tent conclud that declar on the basi of per serv is prefer becaus report inform sole on a per unit basi could confus consum when more that on unit is to be consum at on time e g two capsul with each meal the agenc express concern that if consum do not notic or do not understand the head that state per unit thei might assum that the inform is for the amount specifi for consumpt at on time i e per serv particularli becaus inform for food in convent food form is express on a per serv basi furthermor the agenc tent conclud that consist with the label of food in convent food form in thi regard is the best approach becaus it will reduc consum confus 58 fr 33715 at 33717 inasmuch as most of the comment support the propos rule on thi issu and comment oppos did not provid ani inform demonstr that there is enhanc consum understand or eas of us when inform is express on a daili basi the agenc is not chang 101 36 b 3 in respons to these comment fda ha reconsid it posit in respons to comment request us of the term amount per tablet and each tablet contain howev in light of the comment the agenc conclud that where the serv size is on tablet there is littl if ani chanc for misunderstand if either of these term is us in place of the term amount per serv therefor the agenc is revis 101 36 b 3 to state that when the serv size of the product is on unit a head consist with the declar of serv size such as amount per tablet or each tablet contain mai be us in lieu of amount per serv other appropri term such as capsul packet or teaspoon mai be us in place of the term serv while a consist chang in 101 9 d 4 appear reason fda believ that it is necessari to address such a chang through notic and comment rulemak the agenc intend to propos such a chang in the near futur c nutrient inform 1 list of nutrient name and amount 11 sever comment recommend that inform on the quantit amount by weight for the nutrient list should be present in a separ column rather than immedi follow nutrient name these comment state that some consum bui on the basi of amount us them to make product comparison and that separ column would help consum to more readili locat thi inform an addit comment request that inform on amount be present either in a separ column or after the percent daili valu in parenthesi on the other hand sever comment support the propos rule argu that the format for dietari supplement of vitamin or miner should follow the format for food in convent food form the agenc disagre with the recommend that inform on the quantit amount by weight for the nutrient list should be present in a separ column the agenc observ that space on the label is conserv by not requir a separ column furthermor fda believ that the comprehens of thi inform will be enhanc when it is present immedi next to the name of the nutrient as discuss in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2117 multipl column nutrient inform displai ar much more difficult than singl column displai for consum to us for product comparison both fda first experiment format studi and the major industri format studi found that declar nutrient amount per serv in adjac column of gram per milligram g mg amount and percent daili valu led consum to make more mistak and to take longer on the product comparison type of task ref 3 and 4 fda second experiment studi howev show that when g mg nutrient amount inform wa place immedi next to the nutrient name in an unord arrai and percent were place in a column arrai the advers effect on product comparison perform disappear ref 5 thu the agenc is requir in 101 36 b 3 that the name of each nutrient list shall be immedi follow by the quantit amount by weight of the nutrient to be consist with 101 9 d 7 i 12 a few comment request that onli the calcium portion of calcium glucon be list in the nutrit panel and on the princip displai panel similarli anoth comment request that the agenc clarifi that vitamin b6 refer to pyridoxin not pyridoxin hydrochlorid the agenc wish to emphas that the declar of the quantit amount by weight in the nutrit label is to indic the weight of a particular nutrient and not the weight of the salt of that nutrient us to make the supplement for exampl onli the calcium portion of calcium glucon is to be declar in the nutrit label although in some circumst the weight of the whole substanc mai appear on the princip displai panel if it clearli refer to the whole substanc such as when the statement of ident state calcium glucon 600 mg similarli onli the pyridoxin portion of pyridoxin hydrochlorid is to be declar in the nutrit label the agenc believ that no chang in 101 36 ar necessari base on these comment 13 on comment recommend that biotin and folat be declar in term of microgram g not mg and that calcium and phosphoru be declar in term of mg not g the comment state that consum ar more familiar with these nutrient be express in thi manner fda propos on juli 19 1990 56 fr 29476 to chang to the unit suggest in thi comment howev section 203 of the ds act prohibit fda from adopt ani refer valu for vitamin and miner differ from the us rda contain in 101 9 c 7 iv as in effect on octob 6 1992 until after novemb 8 1993 accordingli fda adopt those us rda valu as the rdi with biotin and folat express in term of mg and calcium and phosphoru express in term of g sinc the prohibit in section 203 of the ds act ha now expir the agenc is propos elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist to amend 101 9 to chang the unit of declar for biotin and folat to g and for calcium and phosphoru to mg thi propos respond fulli to the comment 14 on comment wa oppos to the agenc s propos in 101 36 b 3 to allow amount of protein below 1 g to be left off the nutrit label thi comment request that such amount of protein be declar becaus individu who ar highli sensit to monosodium glutam msg mai have advers reaction fda ha recogn that certain individu ar sensit to msg and believ that the appropri mean to convei the presenc of thi ingredi to consum is by us of the ingredi statement becaus msg is a food ingredi the agenc reiter that dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar requir to compli with 101 4 21 cfr 101 4 which requir full ingredi label of food furthermor in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 the agenc propos chang in the regul pertain to ingredi label to accommod those individu who ar sensit to msg propos 101 22 58 fr 2950 would requir that when the amount of free glutam in hydrolyz protein reach a specifi level the declar in the ingredi statement must includ the parenthet contain glutam the agenc ha reexamin propos 101 36 in respons to thi comment and note that there is an inconsist in the label of protein total carbohydr and dietari fiber between 101 9 and propos 101 36 for exampl 0 5 g to 0 99 g of these substanc in a dietari supplement of a vitamin or miner would not be declar under propos 101 36 b 3 yet these amount in a food in convent food form would be declar either as 1 g or less than 1 g under 101 9 c to correct thi inconsist the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 to provid that amount of nutrient that can be declar as zero in the nutrit label of food in convent food form shall not be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner thu the agenc is requir the declar of protein as well as total carbohydr and dietari fiber when thei ar present in amount of 0 5 g to 1 g amount under 0 5 g would continu to not be list in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner becaus these amount would allow a declar of zero in the nutrit label of food in convent form 15 on comment recommend that activ ingredi present at less than 2 percent of the daili valu be allow to be list in the nutrit label the agenc is not allow vitamin and miner except sodium and potassium which ar not includ in 101 9 c 8 iv present at less than 2 percent of the daili valu to be list becaus the declar of such amount would be mislead such valu ar insignific under 101 9 f and mai be declar as 0 percent of the rdi in the nutrit label of food in convent food form thei ar amount that ar dietet trivial and physiolog inconsequenti in addit fda is concern that some consum will be misl by the mere presenc of name of nutrient within the nutrit label becaus thei would assum that product with more nutrient list have a greater public health signific than those with less regardless of the amount of each nutrient present the agenc is unawar of ani reason nor doe the comment present ani reason for allow the declar of nutrient that ar present in such small amount thu the agenc is make no chang in respons to thi comment 16 on comment request that fda revis 101 36 b 3 i to more clearli state the increment to be us for express the quantit amount by weight of vitamin and miner anoth comment state that amount should not be round thi comment state we realli see no reason why product should not be formul to contain the amount state on the label subject to reason overag base on shelf life consider and the like and reason analyt variat the agenc inadvert did not address the increment to be us for express the quantit amount by weight of vitamin and miner propos 101 36 b 3 i state that amount of vitamin and miner ar to be express in the increment specifi in 101 9 c us the unit of measur and the level of signific given in 101 9 c 8 iv except that zero follow decim point mai be drop while the agenc is adopt thi rule fda recogn that as the comment point out 101 9 c doe not address the question of the increment in which the quantit amount of vitamin and miner ar to be declar becaus in the nutrit label of food in convent food form vitamin and miner ar declar onli as a percentag of the daili valu the quantit amount by weight of these nutrient except for potassium and sodium which ar consid electrolyt ar not requir in the nutrit label of convent food the agenc ha consid thi issu and note that dietari supplement unlik most food in convent food form ar fabric to contain specif amount of vitamin and miner it is for thi reason that the vitamin and miner in dietari supplement ar categor as class i nutrient and that under 101 9 g 4 a food is misbrand if it contain less of an ad vitamin or miner than the amount declar on the label in view of how dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar made the agenc agre that it make no sens to permit the amount of vitamin and miner in such product to be round and declar onli in specifi increment therefor the agenc ha modifi 101 36 b 3 i to provid that the actual amount of vitamin and miner in the supplement ar to be declar us the unit of measur specifi in 101 9 c 8 iv except that zero follow decim point mai be drop with respect to level of signific that is the number of decim place us in declar amount the agenc propos that onli the level of signific shown in 101 9 c 8 iv could be present in some case howev the number of decim place allow is not suffici to express actual amount of certain vitamin and miner becaus the amount ar veri small for exampl a product that contain 10 percent of the daili valu for copper would contain 0 2 mg of copper if the amount of copper had to be express us the same level of signific as that us in 101 9 c 8 iv for express it rdi i e 2 mg the lowest amount that could be declar would be 1 mg which would be inaccur high to ensur that amount of vitamin and miner that have nutrit signific can be declar the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 i to provid that amount shall be express in the increment specifi in 101 9 c except that addit level of signific mai be us when the number of decim place indic is not suffici to express lower amount e g the rdi for copper is given in whole mg but the quantit amount mai be declar in tenth of a mg addition the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 i to describ how amount of the nutrient from na 9th and 10th edit ref 2 and 10 for which rdi have not been establish ar to be declar amount for chlorid fluorid and manganes shall be express in mg and amount for chromium molybdenum selenium and vitamin k shall be express in g these valu shall be express in whole number except that tenth mai be us for fluorid these valu reflect the amount in which the rdi or easddl for these nutrient ar given ref 2 and 10 17 on comment state there wa an appar inconsist between the requir in 101 36 b 3 ii that nutrient be list in the order specifi in 101 9 c except that calcium and iron when present should be group with other miner and the sequenc of vitamin d and vitamin e in the exampl provid in 101 36 c 8 the comment recommend that the appropri order of nutrient be clarifi in the regul while fda find no inconsist with the sequenc of vitamin d and vitamin e in the sampl label provid in 101 36 c 8 the agenc point out that there wa an error in the order of nutrient in 101 9 c 8 iv in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2227 fda publish a correct in the feder regist of april 1 1993 58 fr 17104 which list the order as follow vitamin a vitamin c calcium iron vitamin d vitamin e thiamin riboflavin niacin vitamin b6 folat vitamin b12 biotin pantothen acid phosphoru iodin magnesium zinc and copper thi order is the on us by fda in the june 18 1993 propos on nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner except that calcium and iron were list with the miner follow pantothen acid the agenc wish to make these regul as clear as possibl therefor in respons to the comment s request for clarif of the appropri order of nutrient and to make clear where in the list to includ the nutrient that have no rdi but that ar requir to be includ in the nutrit label on dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when thei ar present fda is revis 101 36 b 3 ii to specifi the exact order in which vitamin and miner ar to be declar see section ii comment 1 of thi document ani nutrient not present in the supplement or present at insignific level must be omit from the list 18 at least on comment request that vitamin be list in alphabet order anoth comment request that calcium and magnesium be the first miner to be list the agenc ha not accept these suggest as discuss in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33719 with the except of calcium and iron fda propos in 101 36 b 3 ii that nutrient declar in the nutrit label of vitamin or miner supplement be list in the order that nutrient ar list in the nutrit label of food in convent food form the agenc propos that calcium and iron be list after the list of ani vitamin that ar present so that all of the vitamin will be group togeth while vitamin a and vitamin c ar to be list first consist with 101 9 c thei ar then follow by the fat solubl vitamin then the water solubl vitamin and the miner the na in it rda public ha tradition group the fat solubl vitamin ahead of the water solubl vitamin the agenc note that thi order is follow on the label of mani vitamin supplement in the marketplac the comment request alphabet order gave no convinc justif for follow a differ order and thu fda is not chang the order addition the comment request that calcium and magnesium be the first miner to be list present no reason for the agenc to make thi chang calcium and iron ar requir to be the first miner list on the label of food in convent food form in the absenc of ani reason for why calcium and magnesium should be the first miner to be declar on the label of supplement of vitamin and miner the agenc is make no chang in the order for miner 19 on comment request that 101 36 b 3 ii be revis to requir that potassium be list with the other miner prefer last on the list thi comment and other express confus about whether potassium could be list and request clarif on comment request that 101 36 b 3 be clarifi to allow for the voluntari list of potassium in dietari supplement becaus accord to the comment potassium is usual present at less than 100 mg per tablet primarili becaus of exist fda restrict on potassium salt prepar the agenc agre that the list of potassium need clarif potassium is not requir to be list on the nutrit label of food in convent food form howev it can be list voluntarili and when it is it is to be list under sodium as an electrolyt rather than with the miner in contrast the agenc propos that potassium be requir to be list on the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when present in supplement at more than insignific amount i e 5 mg and abov consist with the list of other vitamin and miner the agenc know of no reason why potassium in supplement of vitamin and miner should be treat differ from other vitamin and miner in these product and the comment did not provid a reason for why the list of potassium should be voluntari rather than mandatori therefor the agenc is not make thi chang howev the agenc is modifi the languag of 101 36 b 3 to make it clear that the declar of potassium is requir when it is present at more than insignific amount to thi end fda ha revis the second sentenc of 101 36 b 3 to state in addit potassium shall be declar except when present at an amount that allow a declar of zero with respect to the placement of potassium within the nutrit label fda agre with the comment that the regul should be modifi the propos state that nutrient that ar present shall be list in the order specifi in 101 9 c which would mean that potassium as well as sodium would preced the list of ani other vitamin or miner present in a supplement fda ha conclud that it is not appropri and might confus consum to have the declar of potassium as well as that of sodium preced the declar of other vitamin and miner on these label becaus tradition vitamin have appear first the agenc agre with the comment that it is appropri for potassium to be list at the bottom of the list becaus it is an electrolyt and the electrolyt chlorid is list at the bottom for the same reason the agenc conclud that sodium should be list with the other electrolyt accordingli the agenc is revis 101 36 b 3 ii to state that sodium and potassium should be list in that order follow the electrolyt chlorid at the bottom of the list of miner 20 on comment request clarif regard the label to be us on a packag that ha two compart each contain a differ supplement to be taken at the same time three time daili with meal the compani ask if the regul permit the inform for both supplement to be report aggreg in on nutrit label that ha on column of name and amount and on column of percent daili valu the firm request that if an aggreg label is not permit the addit nutrit label be permit in a packag insert the compani also ask how the inform should be present if children on to four year of ag ar to take the same amount as adult and how it is to be present if such children ar to take half the amount of adult the agenc advis that if two supplement ar to be taken at the same time on unit of each three time daili the nutrit inform for both supplement must be report aggreg in thi situat the serv size must clearli state that a serv includ on of each supplement with on column list name and the total quantit amount by weight for both supplement and anoth column contain the total percent daili valu if thi product is also repres for us by children on to four year of ag the percent daili valu for thi ag group would have to be present in a third column in the case where the serv size is differ for children a nutrit label for adult and a separ nutrit label for children must be us to avoid confus 21 a few comment request that the declar of the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten be mandatori these comment argu that thi inform is need to help consum compar the amount of beta caroten in variou product thei state that thi inform would help consum understand claim such as now with beta caroten on of these comment request the voluntari declar of the quantit amount of beta caroten in addit to the percentag of vitamin a present as beta caroten thi comment state that calcul of vitamin a and beta caroten valu ar difficult even for scientist and that mere provid a percentag will not allow consum to readili determin just how much beta caroten is present in the product the comment request that the amount of beta caroten be express in mg two comment request that the percent of vitamin a present as retinol also be mandatori on of these comment explain that most peopl ar better off get their vitamin a from beta caroten rather than from retinol becaus beta caroten is safer in high dose and mai help reduc the risk of certain cancer heart diseas cataract and other health problem fda is not persuad that the declar of the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten should be mandatori becaus quantit recommend about the intak of beta caroten have not yet been establish by the scientif commun in the juli 19 1990 mandatori nutrit label propos 55 fr 29476 at 29493 the agenc set out the factor that it consid in decid whether a nutrient or food compon should be mandatori or voluntari in nutrit label the agenc ha propos to make the declar of a nutrient or food compon mandatori in nutrit label when quantit intak recommend with respect to the nutrient or compon ar highlight in the report e g reduc total fat intak to 30 or less of calori and the nutrient or compon is of particular public health signific as defin in sever recent consensu document on the other hand for those nutrient or food compon for which quantit intak recommend ar not highlight but that do have some public health signific or for which quantit recommend ar avail but that ar not of press public health import e g the recommend dietari allow for sever vitamin and miner the agenc is propos to make declar of the nutrient or compon voluntari 55 fr 29487 at 29493 the agenc conclud that it decis to have the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten be voluntari is consist with these guidelin becaus quantit intak recommend have not been establish on the other hand if a claim about beta caroten is made inform on the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten is need to help consum to understand the claim therefor the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 iv to requir declar of the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten when a claim is made about beta caroten the agenc tent conclud that a parallel chang in 101 9 c 8 vi for the label of food in convent food form is appropri the agenc intend to propos thi chang in the near futur the agenc is accept the comment s suggest to provid that when the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten is declar the quantit amount of beta caroten mai also be declar voluntarili the agenc is persuad by the comment that thi inform on the label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner would be us to those individu who ar interest in maintain a certain quantit intak of beta caroten in their diet the agenc note that the comment request that the amount of beta caroten be declar in term of mg howev the agenc is requir that intern unit iu be us in place of mg to be consist with the declar of vitamin a fda find the us of thi ad inform would be reduc if the unit us to quantifi vitamin a and beta caroten level differ accordingli the agenc is amend 101 36 b 3 iv to provid that when the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten is declar the quantit amount in term of iu mai also be declar e g vitamin a 5000 iu 90 percent 4500 iu as beta caroten the agenc intend to propos a parallel chang in 101 9 c 8 vi as soon as possibl until the agenc doe so the agenc advis that it is unlik that it will take enforc action against food regul under 101 9 that declar beta caroten in a manner consist with 101 36 b 3 iv as long as thei compli with 101 9 in all other respect addition the provis on type size requir for the ad statement on beta caroten in 101 36 c 6 is correct to refer to paragraph b 3 iv instead of to b 3 ii there wa an inadvert error in thi refer in the propos with respect to retinol the agenc conclud that in accord with the guidelin set out abov the declar of retinol should be neither mandatori nor voluntari becaus of the absenc of quantit intak recommend and of public health signific thu the agenc is not chang the propos rule to provid for the inclus of retinol in the nutrit label 22 on comment request that 101 36 b 3 v be revis to permit common synonym instead of onli the synonym specifi thi comment state that allow all synonym would provid peopl with more inform and would ensur that the content of product were in fact comprehens to more peopl the comment mention for exampl that niacin is known by mani as vitamin b3 and vitamin e by the name alpha tocopherol anoth comment express support for restrict the us of synonym to the on allow in the propos rule the agenc is not persuad that the provis on synonym should be revis to permit common synonym instead of onli the synonym specifi the terminolog that the agenc ha recogn is that which is us in na rda tabl ref 2 these includ vitamin c ascorb acid thiamin vitamin b1 riboflavin vitamin b2 folat folacin and calori energi the agenc ha restrict the us of synonym to simplifi nutrit label and to avoid potenti confus among consum the agenc believ that allow the unrestrict us of other synonym will contribut to confus about the nutrient that ar present in the product it will also make product comparison more difficult becaus of the absenc of consist terminolog therefor fda is not make the chang request by the comment 23 at least on comment request that the nutrit label of vitamin with iron for exampl be allow to highlight the list of iron the comment state that such highlight is a us and necessari tool to differenti variou product line the agenc is not persuad that the highlight of iron in the exampl describ in the comment is necessari for consum to differenti between variou product line becaus the name or statement of ident of the product must identifi the product as a multivitamin with iron thi identif is suffici to differenti the product from other multivitamin product as discuss in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2138 fda is not permit highlight of thi type becaus it can be us inconsist in a wai that would be potenti mislead to consum among product with similar nutrit profil some would highlight certain nutrient and other would not consum could not depend on the fact that all label of similar product would look the same and the differ in highlight could undermin the credibl of the inform on the nutrit label and lead to consum confus accordingli the agenc is not provid for the highlight request by the comment 24 a number of comment suggest that the sourc of a vitamin or miner be includ in the nutrit label immedi follow the list of that vitamin or miner in a manner similar to the allow list of beta caroten as a sourc of vitamin a on comment state that thi inform should be list in a separ column entitl sourc on comment request that the sourc inform should at least be option the comment state that if thi suggest is adopt it will be unnecessari to repeat sourc inform in the ingredi statement and on comment request that the regul on ingredi label be revis accordingli the comment said that thi approach would conserv space and more effect commun sourc inform to consum the agenc note that the parenthet list of the sourc of a vitamin or miner in the nutrit label is a common practic by some but not all manufactur in the dietari supplement industri the agenc find howev that the comment submit fail to provid adequ justif and support inform demonstr that adopt on an industri wide basi of thi manner of express nutrit and ingredi inform would result in a nutrit label that is readili observ and comprehens as requir by the act comment have not demonstr that consum will be abl to distinguish and understand the mean of both the nutrit and ingredi inform provid fda ha no mean on which to determin for exampl whether the name of the sourc of the nutrient is inde that and not the chemic name of the nutrient the comment also fail to provid data to demonstr that thi manner of present truli conserv label space especi if addit column ar ad to the nutrit label further if as suggest by on comment sourc inform within the nutrit label were made option the consist of present of inform that ha been a guid principl of the agenc throughout the food label reform effort would be violat accordingli the agenc is not provid for the parenthet list of nutrient sourc within the nutrit label the agenc advis howev that it would be recept to a adequ support petit on thi issu and that it will act expediti on such petit given that elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist the agenc is establish a date of applic of juli 1 1995 for the regul govern nutrit label of dietari supplement if a petit is promptli submit that petit could be act upon befor the date of applic ani petit submit to permit sourc declar within the nutrit label would have to address in detail at least the issu of how the sourc inform is to be consist and clearli express and why thi manner of express is advantag to the consum becaus a primari purpos of the nutrit label is to allow consum to compar the nutrit profil of product at the point of purchas it is imper that there be a high degre of consist in the present of nutrit inform for all dietari supplement fda would also need inform on precis how sourc inform should be express within the nutrit label for exampl how would the sourc inform be express if a singl ingredi e g fish liver oil is a sourc of a number of nutrient e g vitamin a and d within a dietari supplement if the sourc is requir to be list multipl time how doe thi conserv label space also would multipl list of a sourc mislead consum about the amount of the ingredi in the food convers if a nutrient in a supplement is provid from sever sourc e g iodin from kelp and potassium iodid how would thi inform be clearli and consist convei would the sourc list be all sourc or onli the primari sourc of the nutrient if sourc list in the nutrit label were to be limit to the primari sourc how would the primari sourc be determin ar safeguard necessari to ensur that consum ar not misl by inappropri emphasi on certain sourc of nutrient for exampl how would consum be fulli inform and be protect from be misl if a nutrient is deriv from more than on sourc and onli the primari sourc is list particularli if a valu ingredi provid some but not all of the nutrient in question should sourc inform be permit in the nutrit label onli when there is some signific to the sourc for exampl becaus there ar potenti safeti concern about high intak of vitamin a from some other sourc fda found that there is wa a public health reason for permit beta caroten to be shown as a sourc of vitamin a should such a find be a prerequisit for permit sourc label if sourc label is limit to case in which the sourc is signific e g particularli valu sourc concern about other potenti sourc how should such signific be consist determin also ani petit on sourc label in the nutrit label should address the issu of clariti of present section 2 b 1 a of the 1990 amend state that the nutrit inform should be readili observ and comprehens would ad inform about the sourc of nutrient detract from the comprehens of the nutrit label given that sourc inform will be avail in the ingredi statement would sourc declar unnecessarili burden the nutrit label and detract from it primari purpos of provid a nutrient profil of the product would it be more difficult for consum to find the list of the quantit amount by weight of nutrient in the nutrit label when sourc inform is given petit on thi issu would be strengthen by the inclus of consum survei or other similar data show that consum readili observ and comprehend inform present in the manner suggest by the comment as discuss in the mandatori label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2170 dietari supplement of vitamin and miner like other food ar requir to bear a complet list of ingredi under section 403 i 2 of the act the statement of ingredi must list all ingredi of these food includ for exampl lactos and other filler artifici color flavor binder and excipi as well as the sourc of the vitamin and miner in the dietari supplement thi section of the act provid fda with author to grant exempt from the ingredi list requir but such exempt have not been sought by the dietari supplement industri the agenc advis that the fact that the name of an ingredi appear elsewher on the label is not in and of itself suffici justif to grant such exempt therefor ani petit on thi subject must address the issu of how thi manner of present of the sourc of nutrient continu to fulfil the primari purpos of the ingredi label to adequ inform consum about all ingredi us to make a food includ those that might be of concern becaus of person health reason e g lactos the agenc advis that it current polici as state in the feder regist of august 2 1973 38 fr 20730 and march 16 1979 44 fr 16005 and in subsequ correspond with industri ref 6 and 7 is that the label for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner must contain a list of nutrient and a separ full statement of ingredi except those exempt by section 403 i 2 of the act declar by their common or usual name thi polici is consist with the ingredi declar requir for other type of product therefor for all the reason cite abov fda ha decid not to take the action request by these comment pend receipt and review of petit on thi issu 2 list of percent daili valu 25 the agenc receiv a number of comment that oppos the us of the term percent daili valu and that state that thei prefer to continu to us the term percent us rda the agenc disagre with these comment as explain in the final rule on rdi that publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2206 at 2207 and 2208 the agenc ha establish two set of label refer valu i e rdi which were previous the us rda and drv becaus the agenc believ the us of the two term on food label could be confus to consum it establish a singl term daili valu to refer to both the rdi and drv 58 fr 2079 at 2124 the comment did not provid ani new argument or data that were not consid in that rulemak furthermor the agenc advis that it know of no reason why dietari supplement of vitamin and miner should not us the terminolog prescrib for food in gener consist in terminolog will assist consum in maintain healthi dietari practic by facilit their us of the nutrit label to construct a healthi diet that includ both dietari supplement and food in convent food form therefor the agenc is not make ani chang in the regul in respons to these comment 26 on comment request that the agenc elimin the us of the term rdi and us the term drv for both macronutri and micronutri the comment state that it is confus to have more the on term the comment appear to be request new term not onli for the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner but also for the nutrit label of food in convent food form the term rdi and drv were establish in the final rule on rdi 58 fr 2206 as discuss in the propos rule of juli 19 1990 55 fr 29476 at 29479 the distinct between the rdi and drv is necessari for sever reason first the rdi ar base on the rda which ar consid intak level to be achiev howev while some drv ar base on recommend to increas or maintain intak of the particular food compon other drv reflect level that ar limit on intak furthermor mani of the drv must be base on a specif calor intak and unlik the rdi the drv ar not relev for infant and young children final the rdi serv as criteria for us in sever regulatori function such as the applic of the agenc s food fortif polici and the assess of the nutrit equival of imit food the drv do not have such us therefor fda believ that it is appropri to treat rdi and drv as two differ set of refer valu howev the agenc note that both term ar refer to as daili valu on the nutrit label the agenc believ that the us of a singl term on the label will limit consum confus thu the concern articul by the comment is fulli address by fda current regulatori scheme accordingli the agenc is not make the request chang 27 on comment request that product contain 5 to 17 mg of potassium should be allow to state contain less than 1 percent of the daili valu of thi nutrient the comment explain that 17 mg of potassium express to the nearest whole percent come to 0 percent daili valu 3 500 mg divid by 17 which round to zero yet 101 9 c 5 onli allow amount less than 5 mg to be consid as zero as a result the nutrit label of such a product would state 15 mg potassium and 0 percent daili valu the comment express concern that such appar contradictori statement would be confus to consum the comment identifi a concern applic to dietari supplement and food in convent food form name that consum mai find it confus when there is a quantit amount by weight for a

commonli provid on dietari supplement label to allevi thi space problem a number of comment request that fda allow smaller type size on comment request a minimum type size of 3 0 point and anoth 4 0

that such type is necessari on variou size label such as those with surfac area of less than 25 15 12 and 10 squar inch final a few comment suggest that the regul should state that type size should be

in the top box a manufactur s decis to follow the usp approach would result in a nutrit label that wa inconsist with label of other dietari supplement of vitamin and miner with dietari supplement of

base upon it usp statu fda find that it would not be consist with section 2 b 1 a of the 1990 amend to provid the flexibl sought by these comment as discuss in respons to earlier comment the agenc

supplement howev on comment state that consist in definit for nutrient content claim for dietari supplement and food in convent food form is inappropri the comment argu that fda ha chosen to defin nutrient content claim that ar not meaning to the supplement industri and to consum mani comment point out that dietari supplement ar intend to contribut with food in convent food form to consum daili nutrient intak thu the comment argu that it is import that the term us to describ the level of nutrient in both dietari supplement and food in convent food form be consist these comment maintain that consum would be confus if claim were to be allow on dietari supplement that were not defin in the same manner as those for food in convent food form fda disagre with the comment that said that consist with establish nutrient content claim is inappropri as a basic principl for defin nutrient content claim for dietari supplement there is much about dietari supplement that suggest that the principl that guid fda in defin nutrient content claim for dietari supplement should be the same as the principl that guid the agenc in defin nutrient content claim on food in convent food form dietari supplement that ar not intend for us as drug have tradition been regul as food and as such must be evalu within the context of the total daili diet in addit nutrient from dietari supplement serv the same physiolog function as nutrient from food in convent food form while some consum seek to ensur that the nutrient content of their diet is adequ through food in convent food form other consum seek to ensur nutrit adequaci by make dietari supplement part of their diet ref 1 consist us of term on dietari supplement and on food in convent food form will thu help consum to construct a nutrition adequ total daili diet by allow consum to make meaning comparison among these product it will also facilit us of these term by consum over the year fda ha stress the import of consist definit and descript term as a necessari requir for effect educ and for prevent mislead label ref 2 if term were given differ definit depend on whether thei were to be us to describ food in convent food form or dietari supplement it would make it much more difficult for the public to understand what these term ar intend to convei about a particular food moreov a singl definit for a particular term elimin ani possibl that ambigu could be creat by the us of that term therefor the agenc conclud that for nutrient content claim the definit of a particular term should be the same regardless of the type of food that it is be us to describ addition fda ha been critic for treat dietari supplement differ than other food fda ha no desir to discrimin in ani wai against supplement thu by have a singl definit for a particular nutrient content claim fda is provid the basi for dietari supplement to make the same claim as other food and to be factor into the diet like other food nonetheless as discuss in the propos on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement 58 fr 33731 fda recogn that dietari supplement differ in at least two respect from food in convent food form first dietari supplement ar like to contain much higher level of nutrient than food in convent food form thu addit nutrient content claim that ar specif for dietari supplement mai be appropri as discuss later in thi document the agenc intend in the near futur to initi a separ rulemak to establish such claim for dietari supplement second dietari supplement gener do not contain sever nutrient e g fat cholesterol found in food in convent food form therefor in thi document fda is limit the us of certain claim that ar us for describ food in convent food form but that do not meaningfulli describ dietari supplement b gener principl 1 substitut food 3 on comment object to the requir to us the word imit on dietari supplement that ar nutrition inferior to other product of the same type the comment argu that fda wa never given the author to decid on formul of dietari supplement and that set such formul is the exclus role of the manufactur further the comment state that there is noth imit about less in the supplement industri and that a requir that a supplement be label imit if it is nutrition inferior to anoth product forc manufactur to increas potenc in order that their product will not have to be label imit under section 403 r 2 a ii of the act for a food to be label as nutrient free the nutrient must usual be present in the food or in a food for which it substitut as that term is defin by the secretari and by deleg fda for the food accordingli the agenc defin substitut food in 101 13 d 21 cfr 101 3 d in the final rule on nutrient content claim 58 fr 2302 at 2411 for the purpos of identifi the characterist that substitut food must have if thei ar to bear nutrient content claim that highlight differ between them and the food for which thei substitut the definit state that a substitut food is on that mai be us interchang with anoth food that it resembl i e to which it is organolept physic and function includ shelf life similar and to which it is not nutrition inferior unless it is label as an imit addition 101 3 e 1 21 cfr 101 3 e l state that a food shall be deem to be an imit and thu subject to the requir of section 403 c of the act if it is a substitut for or resembl anoth food but is nutrition inferior to that food thu the issu that the agenc must consid is whether dietari supplement that ar food should be subject to these provis on substitut food as ani other food ar the agenc ha no evid that manufactur will increas the potenc for their product to avoid the us of thi term and disagre that thi provis will interfer with a manufactur s right to decid on product formul it is extrem unlik that the term imit will ever be us on dietari supplement particularli dietari supplement of vitamin and miner the issu of whether a supplement would be an imit would aris onli when a manufactur choos to make a free or low claim for sugar or sodium on a dietari supplement see comment 4 in such circumst under section 403 r 2 a ii of the act the manufactur must identifi a product on the market with which it product can be us interchang to which the manufactur product is not nutrition inferior and that contain sodium or sugar such a product mai includ the version of the manufactur s product that contain sodium or sugar as long as such a product exist the manufactur s product need not be label as an imit moreov if becaus of the wai the manufactur ha formul it product there is no product with which it is us interchang the product can be call a sodium free food onli in the rare situat in which neither of the condit appli would the product have to be call imit for it to bear a free or low sodium or sugar claim section 101 13 d 1 and d 2 ar design to ensur that materi differ between the substitut food and the refer food ar conspicu state on the label or label of the food so that consum can make fulli inform judgment about the valu of the substitut food and it us in maintain healthi dietari practic if a product ha substanti less of a nutrient than the refer food and to that extent is materi differ and inferior in nutrient content then imit is an entir appropri term for thi reason the agenc conclud that there is no reason to appli the substitut food provis ani differ to dietari supplement than to other food 2 requir for low and free claim 4 sever comment from dietari supplement manufactur and trade associ question the need to allow low and free claim for nutrient such as fat and cholesterol that ar not typic found in dietari supplement on comment suggest that free low and reduc claim for calori fat and cholesterol on dietari supplement should be permit onli on dietari supplement that ar a signific sourc of calori such as protein supplement the comment argu that consum do not expect most dietari supplement to contain signific amount of calori and that it is nonsens and confus to permit dietari supplement that ar not a signific sourc of calori to make a claim about reduc amount of calori fat and cholesterol contain therein anoth comment state that american who consum dietari supplement do not do so becaus the product ar low in fat cholesterol free or low calori and that consum ar not interest in the fat content of dietari supplement the comment argu that consum care about the substanc in the product and the benefit that those product can have for their health in the propos on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement the agenc request comment on the need for extend free low and reduc claim to dietari supplement 58 fr 33731 at 33745 the agenc ha review the comment that it receiv and is persuad by them that it not meaning to allow claim about the calori fat includ satur fat or cholesterol content of most dietari supplement most of these product do not contain those nutrient and most consum do not expect that thei do thu consum would not gener look to these product in make dietari choic that ar design to control the amount of calori fat satur fat and cholesterol in the food thei eat in fact claim about these nutrient in most dietari supplement would onli serv to confus consum while it is true that fda is requir inform about these nutrient in the nutrit label of supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc thi requir deriv mainli from the limit on the exempt in section 403 q 5 f of the act formerli section 403 q 5 e see the final rule on gener requir for nutrit label for dietari supplement publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist howev the agenc recogn that there ar some dietari supplement such as protein supplement in which the amount of calori in the product is signific to consum on these product the sourc of the calori particularli whether thei ar from fat is relev and us inform therefor fda ha decid base on the comment that it receiv to onli allow calori fat satur fat and cholesterol claim on those dietari supplement in which the amount of calori is import to consum in attempt to defin what thi level of calori should be the agenc look first to 101 9 f 1 and j 4 which said that a food ha insignific calori for the purpos of nutrit label if it ha an amount of calori that can be round to zero section 101 9 c 1 state that less than 5 calori per serv mai be express as zero the same amount that is defin as calori free while fda doe not have inform on the calor content of dietari supplement it would not be unreason to expect that mani dietari supplement contain more than 5 calori cal per serv particularli children s chewabl vitamin and miner supplement supplement that contain herbal extract and supplement that contain calor binder and filler thu to tie the us of free low and reduc calori fat and cholesterol claim on label of dietari supplement to the presenc of more than an insignific amount of calori in the food would be over inclus and would allow mani product in which the amount of calori is not signific to consum to bear such claim fda next look at the definit of low calori in 101 60 b 2 21 cfr 101 60 b 2 for us in determin which dietari supplement should be allow to bear free low and reduc claim section 101 60 b 2 defin a low calori food as a food that contain 40 cal or less per refer amount customarili consum hereinaft refer to as refer amount and per 50 gram g if the refer amount is small fda believ that 40 cal per refer amount repres a reason level for demarc a dietet relev sourc of calori for dietari supplement in a product that contain thi amount of calori the sourc of the calori e g fat is of signific to consum accordingli the agenc is revis 101 62 a 21 cfr 101 62 a by ad paragraph a 4 to state that free low and reduc claim for fat satur fat and cholesterol mai not be made for dietari supplement that meet the criteria in 101 60 b 1 and b 2 for calori free and low calori claim fda is also revis 101 13 b by ad new paragraph b 5 to reflect these provis as a consequ claim that identifi all product of that class of be low or free of a nutrient e g vitamin c supplement a fat free supplement will also be prohibit howev to us the same criteria i e that a product mai not be calori free or low calori as a basi for when a calori claim mai be made ha the effect of prohibit the veri claim that the criterion seek to permit name calori free and low calori claim such a criterion would permit onli rel calori claim e g reduc on dietari supplement therefor a slightli differ scheme for permit calori claim on certain dietari supplement such as protein supplement must be deriv while as state abov the agenc believ that calori claim should not be permit on most dietari supplement it doe believ that calori free and low calori claim mai be appropri if an equival amount of a similar food i e anoth protein supplement that the label food resembl and for which it substitut would normal contain an appreci amount of calori such a claim would highlight that the label food had a differ calori profil than would be expect in the similar product it would also serv to direct a consum to a product that had a lower amount of calori becaus the food would meet the criteria for low calori and would be so label it would not be necessari to highlight ani compar differ between the label and the similar food as would be requir for a rel claim therefor the agenc is revis 101 62 a by ad new paragraph a 4 to state that claim for calori mai not be made on label of dietari supplement that meet the criteria in 101 60 b 1 or b 2 for calori free and low calori except when an equival amount of a similar dietari supplement e g anoth protein supplement that the label food resembl and for which it substitut normal exce the definit for low calori in 101 60 b 2 it is includ similar languag in 101 13 b 5 the comment specif object to claim for calori fat and cholesterol claim for sodium and sugar content were not mention sinc the sugar and sodium level in dietari supplement can vari substanti the agenc find that claim about the sugar and sodium content of dietari supplement mai be us in help consum to make purchas decis that will assist them in maintain healthi dietari practic thu extend the definit of low free and reduc for sugar and sodium to dietari supplement is appropri irrespect of the calori level of the dietari supplement therefor fda conclud that there is no need to place limit on claim for sugar and sodium content other than those in 101 60 c and 101 61 respect as explain below fda is amend these provis to reflect their applic to dietari supplement 3 label mechan a type size 5 in discuss type size for nutrient content claim on comment state that everi new statement that is requir on dietari supplement label will creat a problem for manufactur particularli if thei ar constrain by minimum type size requir the agenc acknowledg that dietari supplement ar frequent packag in small contain and for thi reason fda specif ask for inform on the impact of the type size propos on dietari supplement that ar packag in small contain 58 fr 33731 at 33734 no suggest or exampl were present to assist the agenc in decid how to address thi problem therefor the agenc ha made no special provis for dietari supplement in the type size requir for nutrient content claim fda discuss the type size requir for the nutrit label of dietari supplement in the final rule on nutrit label of dietari supplement publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist fda state in the technic correct document 58 fr 44020 at 44020 and 44021 that there wa a need to specifi the minimum type size for label inform e g accompani inform requir under the nutrient content claim regul as a result the agenc modifi 101 2 b to includ 101 13 101 54 101 56 101 60 101 61 101 62 and 101 65 in the list of section set out in 101 2 b for which a minimum type size for requir label inform is specifi for consist the agenc also modifi 101 2 f to includ 101 13 101 54 101 56 101 60 101 61 101 62 and 101 65 the effect of these revis for dietari supplement is that label inform requir by the nutrient content claim regul but whose type size is not otherwis specifi will be requir to be in letter or number no less than on sixteenth of an inch in height unless otherwis specifi by 101 2 c fda believ that make nutrient content claim on dietari supplement subject to thi requir is appropri becaus thi requir is the logic outgrowth of the propos in the propos on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement fda rais the issu of how to make nutrient content claim on dietari supplement the question of how to ensur the legibl of the referr statement which is requir by section 403 r 2 b of the act is on that is at least implicitli rais by thi issu thu the agenc s decis to explicitli address the question of the type size of the referr statement in thi final rule repres the logic outgrowth of issu that were rais in the propos the agenc point out in the technic correct document that if there ar circumst in which the product is not abl to compli with type size requir manufactur mai request an altern mean of complianc e g permiss to us

write to the offic of food label food and drug administr and request an altern mean of complianc for the reason explain abov dietari supplement of herb and other similar nutrit substanc ar appropri subject to thi provis even though it wa not specif set out in the propos on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement a similar provis is includ in 101 36 d 2 of the final regul for nutrit label for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner in a companion document in thi issu of the feder regist these provis allow flexibl to ensur that there will be either suffici space to make nutrient content claim on the label of dietari supplement or that manufactur will have recours to request relief b disclosur level 6 on comment state that there ar a certain number of product such as chewabl tablet contain sodium ascorb for which inform on sodium might be us to consum in maintain healthi diet the comment suggest that the agenc urg supplement manufactur to includ inform on sodium content even though the sodium level might not reach the threshold level establish in 101 13 h 1 that would trigger a requir statement the agenc disagre that there is a suffici basi for requir either the declar of total sodium content on the princip displai panel of a dietari supplement or for requir a referr statement direct the consum to the nutrit label for inform about sodium content on all dietari supplement section 101 13 h 1 specifi that the referr statement i e see appropri panel for inform about nutrient requir disclosur and other nutrient is requir onli when the sodium or fat satur fat or

in determin whether a product meet the criteria for a nutrient content claim the comment did not suggest an altern to the refer amount that could be us as the basi for compar claim for dietari

there is no basi for confid that cabbag is a good sourc of vitamin k there is also no basi for confid that the amount of vitamin k in the food that is to be the subject of the claim is nutrition signific elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist the agenc ha propos to expand the list of nutrient with rdi includ vitamin k at thi time howev fda conclud that it would be prematur to author such

encourag the agenc to maintain the propos definit for good sourc and high for dietari supplement the comment argu that a higher level e g 40 percent of the rdi would suggest to consum that daili nutrient intak could be achiev by consum onli a few food which is inconsist with dietari guidelin the comment maintain that if a new higher claim level wa adopt for supplement it would like also appli to food in convent food form base on the logic of the propos for nutrient content claim for dietari supplement i e consist in definit the comment state that user of dietari supplement ar well awar of the elev nutrient level in these product and that a new paradigm is not need to inform consum of these level on the other hand sever comment did not support the propos to us the same definit for good sourc and high claim as those us for food in convent food form the comment argu that the term good sourc and high should not carri the same mean for supplement as for food in convent food form that most supplement contain at least 100 percent of the daili valu for most of the nutrient thei provid and that consum expect most of these product to contain at least 100 percent of the daili valu the comment maintain that allow ani product with as littl as 10 or 20 percent of the rdi to carri good sourc and high claim would confus and mislead consum on comment question whether it is appropri to permit the us of these nutrient content claim on vitamin and miner supplement sinc it impli that supplement ar compar to and accept substitut for food in convent food form the comment also note that nutrit educ feel strongli that supplement can enhanc the nutrient intak from food in convent food form but can never replac them sinc food in convent food form provid other import compon on the other hand mani comment support the propos to extend the same definit for good sourc and high for food in convent food form to dietari supplement these comment emphas the import of consist in definit to assist consum educ on comment request clarif on whether the term good sourc and contain will be permit for dietari supplement the comment maintain that such claim provid consum with import inform regard the precis content of variou nutrient and should not be subject to discriminatori treatment sole on the basi of whether such claim ar made for a nutrient in a dietari supplement as oppos to on in a convent food the agenc ha review these comment and is not persuad that the definit of the term good sourc and high should be differ for dietari supplement than for food in convent food form the agenc find that the definit for food in convent food form and dietari supplement should be consist as direct by the 1990 amend section 3 b 1 a iii vi fda defin the term high and the synonym rich in and excel sourc of for us on label and in label in 101 54 58 fr 2302 at 2344 in 101 54 c 1 of final rule on nutrient content claim the agenc state that the term good sourc mai be us to describ a food when a serv of the food contain 10 to 19 percent of the rdi or the drv for a nutrient likewis the agenc state that the term high mai be us to describ a food when a serv contain 20 percent or more of the rdi or the drv fda conclud that the us of these term would permit a suffici number of food item to bear good sourc and high claim to allow consum to us the claim in select food that ar better sourc of nutrient 58 fr 2344 while fda recogn that under the present definit most if not all dietari supplement of vitamin miner potassium and fiber would qualifi for good sourc or high claim the agenc doe not agre with those comment that argu that the definit as propos would be confus or mislead to consum as suggest by the iom report on nutrit label ref 6 the us of consist and target content claim increas consum confid in the valid of the claim fda is awar of no evid to support an altern conclus the basic principl of consist in definit of nutrient content claim is discuss in detail in comment 2 of thi document furthermor the agenc recogn that consum expect dietari supplement to be concentr sourc of nutrient consum studi support thi conclus ref 1 and 5 fda acknowledg that the term good sourc and high might be of limit util in compar nutrient content among dietari supplement of vitamin and miner becaus virtual the entir class of product would qualifi for such claim howev these term mai be us for some singl sourc dietari supplement of calcium biotin or fiber or for multinutri prepar contain these nutrient these nutrient ar gener found in dietari supplement at level below the daili valu addition fda believ that these term would be us in highlight the nutrient content of some herb and other similar nutrit substanc that have nutrient at level high enough to qualifi for the definit of on of the abov term for these reason the agenc is not persuad to preclud the us of these term for dietari supplement the agenc agre with the comment that state that dietari supplement cannot replac food in convent food form in all respect becaus the latter food suppli other import compon howev fda recogn that dietari supplement can be a us part of the diet for those who wish to make sure that thei consum at least the rdi amount for all vitamin and miner or for those who wish to increas their daili intak of a particular substanc abov those level that ar ordinarili avail from convent food thu fda find that us of these term on dietari supplement is appropri fda is convinc that consist in definit of nutrient content claim across the food suppli is necessari consist facilit consum educ by limit the number of term that the public must learn and interpret moreov differ definit for the same term for dietari supplement and food in convent food form would be confus to consum becaus of the difficulti inher in learn altern definit for the same term there is a greater chanc of error and misinterpret when sever definit must be learn for the same term thu differ definit would like do more harm than good accordingli the agenc conclud that the propos definit for good sourc and high ar appropri and that there is no reason to defin the term differ for dietari supplement the agenc would like to clarifi that good sourc and contain as defin 101 54 c 1 ar nutrient content claim that can be us for food in convent food form as well as for dietari supplement there is noth in thi final rule that state that the us of these term would not be allow for dietari supplement 15 on comment state that under fda propos consum who want truli high level that is level that exce the rdi would have no mean of identifi those product other than read the fine print on the back of each supplement label the comment acknowledg that consum might also be confus if high had on mean when the claim appear on label of dietari supplement and a differ mean when the claim appear on label of food in convent food form to avoid that inconsist the comment urg fda to prohibit the claim good sourc and high on supplement further the comment suggest that the agenc should defin the term high potenc and allow it to be us onli on supplement fda disagre that the term good sourc and high should be prohibit on the label of dietari supplement the agenc recogn that a claim of high will not specif identifi those product that have level of nutrient that exce the rdi howev the quantit amount of a nutrient in a dietari supplement is often a part of the statement of ident for the product and addit quantit inform regard the level of a nutrient mai also be found in amount or percentag statement on the princip displai panel in addit as a result of the agenc s new format requir the nutrit label for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner provid quantit inform on the level of specif nutrient as well as the percent dv for each nutrient in a more legibl format consequ consum will have easi access to inform regard the level of specif nutrient and mai adjust their level of intak accordingli further as discuss in the previou comment while the term good sourc and high mai be of limit util for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner these term mai be us in highlight the nutrit content of singl nutrient such as biotin and calcium that ar gener found in product at level well below the rdi as well as of dietari supplement of herb and other similar nutrit product therefor fda conclud that preclud the us of these term on dietari supplement is unjustifi howev fda believ that there is a suffici basi to consid defin the term high potenc or some similar term as a nutrient content claim fda tent view is that thi term or a similar term when defin could provid a wai for manufactur to describ the higher level of nutrient in dietari supplement see comment 25 for further discuss of thi matter b more 16 on comment state that consum could be misl if compar claim ar made among high potenc vitamin miner supplement the comment state that if for exampl on brand of 300 mg vitamin b6 tablet claim that it contain more than a competit 250 mg product then the consum mai get the mislead impress that the former product is better the comment maintain that as custom shop for supplement thei will be abl to readili observ whether on product is more potent than anoth without label claim suggest superior of on over anoth if such a claim result in better sale then a horsepow race would ensu the comment recommend that more claim for vitamin and miner not be allow if the nutrient potenc of the refer product alreadi meet or exce 100 percent of the daili valu the agenc acknowledg that there is the possibl that some manufactur mai choos to increas potenc in order to make a more claim in comparison to anoth brand but the agenc disagre that the limit suggest by the comment is warrant at thi time the agenc point out that more claim for nutrient with an rdi or drv includ those product with nutrient in megados such as those in the exampl cite by the comment must includ the follow inform the percentag or fraction that the nutrient wa increas rel to the rdi or drv the ident of the refer food and the quantit amount of the nutrient present e g contain 20 percent more of the dv for vitamin b6 per tablet than product x the vitamin b6 content of product x is 250 mg thi product contain 300 mg vitamin b6 the nutrit label of a product contain 300 mg of vitamin b6 must state that the product contain 1 500 percent of the daili valu the agenc acknowledg that the amount of inform requir to make a more claim is consider but such inform is necessari to allow consum to readili see how the amount of a nutrient for which a more claim is made fit into the total daili diet furthermor fda believ that the concern regard horsepow race in dietari supplement stem from concern of possibl unfair market among manufactur as well as from safeti concern inher in the addit of veri high level of nutrient to supplement similar concern with food in convent food form led to the establish of fda fortif polici in 1980 thi polici while publish in 104 20 doe not have the forc of a regul howev the agenc ha not found evid of widespread horsepow race with such food the agenc urg industri particularli industri associ to develop standard regard nutrient level and to monitor complianc with those standard to minim ani safeti problem c restrict on label or label claim base on section 411 b 2 b of the act 17 on comment from a trade associ state that the liter read of section 411 b 2 b of the act prohibit give promin on the label of dietari supplement of vitamin or miner to ingredi that ar not vitamin or miner the comment argu that these prohibit result in the withhold of inform that is of interest to consum and that it is increasingli common for manufactur to market product that offer a combin of vitamin miner herb and other dietari substanc the comment state that the princip reason for the purchas of these product is not their vitamin and miner content but the other ingredi the comment invit fda to join the supplement industri in seek an amend to section 411 of the act that will remedi thi problem anoth comment disagre with fda interpret of section 411 b 2 b of the act and suggest that thi section mere prohibit give promin or emphasi to such ingredi the comment argu that nutrient other than vitamin and miner or sourc of vitamin and miner should be permit to appear outsid or immedi follow the nutrit label provid that such inform is not emphas by for exampl be present in type size greater than that us in the nutrit label the comment state that such limit declar would not conflict with current provis of the act and would be fair and reason mean of commun about the presenc of ingredi that provid ad valu to mani dietari supplement product the agenc is persuad by these comment that a clarif of those section of the propos relat to section 411 b 2 b of the act is need section 411 b 2 b of the act state that the label and advertis for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner mai not give promin to or emphas ingredi that ar not vitamin miner or repres as a sourc of vitamin or miner becaus of thi provis nutrient content claim about ingredi that ar not vitamin or miner e g more fiber high protein mai not be made on dietari supplement of vitamin or miner it must be emphas that thi provis pertain onli to dietari supplement of vitamin and miner if for exampl an herbal extract includ vitamin and miner but is label as an herbal extract in complianc with 101 9 and other applic provis and is advertis as such section 411 b 2 b of the act would not appli the same is true for a product that is primarili a protein supplement a protein supplement with ad vitamin and miner that is label and advertis as a protein supplement could declar that it is high in fiber such claim ar permiss as long as thei ar made in accord with section 403 r of the act and thei ar not fals or mislead in ani particular howev section 411 b 2 b of the act make clear that in the label and advertis of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ingredi other than vitamin or miner cannot be emphas or given promin fda interpret promin not sole as a function of type size declar an ingredi outsid or immedi follow the nutrit label is anoth mean of give promin for exampl a statement such as 5 g psyllium except in extrem limit circumst cannot be made on the princip displai panel outsid the nutrit label or immedi follow the nutrit label of a dietari supplement of vitamin and miner becaus such placement give promin to that ingredi howev the declar of psyllium in the ingredi list would not be constru as give promin to that ingredi on the other hand 5 g psyllium could be declar in an amount statement on the princip displai panel outsid or immedi follow the nutrit label on protein supplement on dietari supplement of herbal extract and on dietari supplement of other similar nutrit substanc so long as these dietari supplement ar not subject to section 411 of the act fda advis that if a sugar is an ingredi in a dietari supplement of vitamin or miner claim about the amount of sugar actual in the product would have to be restrict howev sugar free and no ad sugar ar absenc claim that assert that sugar is not an ingredi the agenc conclud that the us of these term is accept on dietari supplement of vitamin or miner as well as on other type of dietari supplement in view of thi clarif the agenc believ that section 411 b 2 b of the act as written is suffici flexibl to accommod claim on product that ar not dietari supplement of vitamin or miner fda believ that it is therefor unnecessari to amend section 411 of the act 2 nutrient content claim for sugar content 18 on comment question the appropri of allow sugar free claim for a dietari supplement contain less than 0 5 g of sugar the comment state that mani supplement come in capsul or tablet that weigh slightli less or not much more than 0 5 g and therefor supplement that ar mostli sugar could us the term sugar free the comment suggest that the term sugar free on a dietari supplement should mean a much lower amount of sugar or that the product should be total devoid of sugar the comment also argu that term such as neglig sourc of sugar dietarili insignific sourc of sugar and trivial sourc of sugar ar not synonym with sugar free becaus such term connot the presenc of some sugar content fda is not persuad by the comment that 0 5 g or less of sugar per serv is an inappropri definit of insignific for sugar for dietari supplement section 101 60 c 1 provid that for a food in convent food form to make a sugar free claim the food must contain less than 0 5 g of sugar per refer amount less than 0 5 g of sugar per refer amount is an amount that is consist with the agenc s polici of defin free claim at or near the reliabl limit of detect and in an amount that is dietet inconsequenti 56 fr 60421 at 60432 as a result even frequent consumpt of a food bear a sugar free claim would not result in an intak of sugar that would affect the overal diet in ani meaning wai fda acknowledg that there mai be situat in which a dietari supplement mai contain a signific proport of sugar on a weight basi and be abl to make the claim sugar free the agenc believ howev that even in such instanc if the total amount of sugar in a serv of the product is less than 0 5 g it net contribut to the total daili diet would be inconsequenti addition fda consid it import that nutrient content claim correspond with the nutrit label which serv as a sourc of specif inform for consum concern the nutrit valu of the food the nutrit label regul allow food contain less than 0 5 g sugar per label serv to declar 0 g of sugar 101 9 c 6 ii and 101 36 b 3 fda reject the suggest that it permit us of the term sugar free onli where there is an absolut absenc of sugar fda believ that it is appropri to appli the term free to a nutrient when a food contain that nutrient in a dietet trivial or physiolog inconsequenti amount even though the nutrient is present at a level at or near it reliabl limit of quantit becaus with modern analyt method the level at which the presenc of a nutrient mai be quantifi is becom increasingli smaller 58 fr 2302 at 2320 the agenc believ that it is appropri to focu on dietari insignific and veri trivial amount have no impact on the diet for the purpos of defin sugar free the agenc also disagre that the term neglig sourc of sugar dietarili insignific sourc of sugar and trivial sourc of sugar ar inappropri synonym for sugar free section 403 r 2 a i of the act state that a nutrient content claim must be defin by regul in addit section 3 b 1 a ix of the 1990 amend provid that those regul mai includ similar term commonli understood to have the same mean the agenc is not awar of ani reason why the abov term ar inappropri synonym for sugar free although these synonym do not convei the absolut absenc of sugar thei reflect that the amount ar dietet trivial and of no dietari signific therefor the agenc reject thi comment 19 on comment state that the term no ad sugar can be us onli when a product is expect to contain sugar but that consum do not know when supplement ar expect to contain sugar the comment suggest that fda should not preclud the us of the term no ad sugar as thi term would be us to consum in identifi those product without sugar the agenc is persuad that a review of the condit for the us of the term no ad sugar is warrant fda did not propos to preclud the us of the term no ad sugar on all dietari supplement the agenc find that thi term is appropri for some dietari supplement such as children s chewabl vitamin that ar frequent sweeten section 101 60 c 2 state that the term no ad sugar without ad sugar or no sugar ad mai be us onli if 1 no amount of sugar as defin in 101 9 c 6 ii or ani ingredi that contain sugar or that function substitut for ad sugar is ad dure process or packag 2 the product doe not contain an ingredi contain ad sugar 3 the sugar content ha not been increas abov the amount present in the ingredi by some mean such as the us of enzym 4 the food that it resembl and for which it substitut normal is formul with sugar and 5 the product bear a statement that the food is not low calori or calori reduc unless the food meet the requir for a low or reduc calori food and that direct consum attent to the nutrit label for further inform on sugar and calori content as is the case for food in convent food form the agenc believ that to avoid mislead consum the term no ad sugar should be limit to dietari supplement that would be expect to contain ad sugar the agenc advis that the purpos of a no ad sugar claim is to identifi a food that differ from a similar food becaus it doe not contain the ad sugar that would normal be present in the similar food for thi provis to be of practic benefit to consum it must preclud the us of the claim on a food where the sugar that ar normal ad ar replac with an ingredi that contain sugar that function substitut for the ad sugar thu the agenc conclud that the us of ani ingredi that contain sugar that would normal be ad to a food preclud the us of the no ad sugar nutrient content claim the agenc believ that claim concern the absenc of ad sugar on product that would not normal contain ad sugar e g dietari supplement of vitamin and miner for adult ar like to mislead consum into think that a particular brand mai be more desir when compar to other brand of the same product fda acknowledg that consum mai not know everi type of product that could be expect to contain sugar howev the final rule on nutrit label for dietari supplement publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist specifi that sugar will be list in the ingredi label and must be declar in the nutrit label if present in more than insignific amount through these provis the consum can readili ascertain which product contain sugar c impli nutrient content claim 1 claim that ar not nutrient content claim section 101 65 b 1 of the final rule on nutrient content claim provid that statement that declar the absenc of food compon or ingredi that ar not nutrient of the type requir to be declar on the nutrit label and that ar intend to facilit avoid for such reason as food intoler e g lactos free religi belief dietari practic such as vegetarian or other nonnutrit relat reason e g 100 percent milk free ar not nutrient content claim in the propos on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement the agenc tent conclud that thi paragraph is applic to dietari supplement and request comment on other exampl that ar appropri for dietari supplement 20 comment suggest that other exampl of term in thi categori includ the follow gluten free wheat free corn free yeast free starch free milk free egg free soi free no artifici ingredi nonirradi and no synthet ingredi the comment request that fda confirm that these statement ar allow on the label none of the term that were submit in the comment other than egg free would constitut nutrient content claim the term egg free can be interpret as an impli claim about cholesterol the agenc point out that it doe not current have a definit for artifici except as that term appli to flavor and color similarli it ha no definit for synthet except as that term appli to flavor and color although these term have not been defin by fda the agenc believ that thei ar not nutrient content claim unless thei ar us in a context in which thei explicitli or implicitli describ the level of a nutrient howev even if these term ar not nutrient content claim manufactur who us them must make sure that their us is not fals or mislead 21 fda propos to includ dietari supplement in the coverag of 101 65 b 4 thi section state that when an ingredi constitut essenti 100 percent of a food so that the name of the ingredi is the statement of ident the name of the ingredi gener doe not constitut an impli nutrient content claim unless it is us in a context to suggest that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount fda us a statement of ident for a dietari supplement in which an ingredi constitut essenti 100 percent of a supplement e g 60 mg vitamin c as an exampl on comment point out that 60 mg vitamin c tablet contain excipi filler binder lubric disintegr other than vitamin c the comment request clarif as to whether in the exampl of vitamin c tablet 101 65 b 4 requir that the amount claim in the statement of ident constitut 100 percent of the claim amount of a food in 101 65 b 4 in the exampl ad to 101 65 b 4 the amount refer to the claim nutrient a tablet state 60 mg vitamin c tablet should contain 60 mg of that nutrient the agenc recogn that a nutrient will not constitut precis 100 percent of some dietari supplement such as vitamin tablet or capsul and advis that small amount of excipi binder lubric or disintegr ad for technolog purpos ar allow in addit to the state nutrient content addition fda point out that under 101 3 c if a food is market in variou option form the particular form is a necessari part of the statement of ident becaus vitamin c is market in tablet capsul and liquid form the form is part of the name therefor thi food should be call 60 mg vitamin c tablet the agenc acknowledg an error in thi regard in the propos and is revis 101 65 b 4 to make the correct 22 on comment state that it is not unusu for a dietari supplement to contain sever nutrient of on type and a singl nutrient of anoth type such as multipl vitamin with iron the comment request confirm that with iron would not repres an impli nutrient content claim the agenc advis that a term such as with iron when us on the statement of ident of a supplement is intend to describ the natur of the food when a statement of ident simpli state with iron or specifi the amount of iron in a product e g multivitamin with 15 mg iron the statement is not a nutrient content claim such statement fall under 101 65 b 5 howev as the agenc state in 101 65 b 5 there mai be case in which other statement on the label or label would have the effect of make the statement into a nutrient content claim for exampl if the label of a multivitamin with iron includ a discuss of the import of iron in the diet fda believ the statement with iron would be an impli claim that the multivitamin is a good sourc of iron if the label is devoid of such inform fda would be unlik to consid the name to be an impli nutrient content claim the agenc will evalu such claim on a case by case basi in the context of the entir label and label to determin whether thei ar nutrient content claim 23 on comment maintain that fda fail to address whether the current us claim of high in antioxid wa within the scope of the propos regul while the term high in antioxid wa not explicitli discuss in the propos regul for nutrient content claim for dietari supplement the agenc consid it to be an impli nutrient content claim that would come under 101 65 fda view is that thi claim impli that the food on which it appear contain a high amount i e at least 20 percent of the rdi see 101 54 b 1 of each antioxid on problem with thi claim howev is that there is no establish definit of antioxid fda believ that a logic place to start in defin thi term is section 3 b 1 a x of the 1990 amend that provis direct fda to determin whether a health claim on antioxid vitamin and cancer could be author under the standard that it establish for dietari supplement under section 403 r 5 d of the act in it propos regul to implement the 1990 amend in respons to thi provis fda consid the effect of vitamin c vitamin e and beta caroten on cancer becaus these nutrient ar the vitamin or provitamin that function as antioxid 56 fr 60624 novemb 27 1991 in the final rule on antioxid vitamin and cancer fda conclud that it select of these nutrient wa appropri 58 fr 2622 januari 6 1993 thu the agenc ha determin that the direct act antioxid vitamin or provitamin includ vitamin c vitamin e and beta caroten base on it review of the inform present at a recent confer entitl antioxid vitamin and cancer and cardiovascular diseas which wa initi by fda the agenc is not awar of ani basi to expand thi list becaus the biolog role of other vitamin as direct antioxid ha not been confirm ref 3 while it is arguabl that fda could author high in antioxid as an impli claim pertain to antioxid vitamin as a logic outgrowth of the propos becaus the claim appli to food in convent food form as well as to dietari supplement the agenc believ that the better cours is to propos to author such a claim in addit the definit of antioxid is not free from controversi the agenc is awar base on it review of dietari supplement whose label current includ a high in antioxid claim that some manufactur view thi term as includ certain miner antioxid miner have not been address by the agenc and therefor final rule implement the 1990 amend do not provid for claim about them thu fda find that a rulemak on the definit of antioxid will provid an opportun to establish the precis mean of thi term consequ fda intend to address thi issu as quickli as possibl in a forthcom propos given that elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist the agenc is establish a date of applic of juli 5 1995 for thi regul fda anticip that there is suffici time to take final action on such a propos befor that

healthiest will be address in that final rule in it final rule on nutrient content claim fda conclud that a claim that a food becaus of it nutrient content mai be us in maintain healthi dietari practic is a claim that character the level of a nutrient in that food 58 fr 2302 at 2375 accordingli the agenc provid in 101 65 d 1 that such statement ar impli nutrient content claim and ar subject

on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement fda request comment on term high potenc high absorpt and balanc which ar often encount on label or in label of dietari supplement and which seem to impli that the dietari supplement will contribut to good health 58 fr 33731 at 33748 the agenc request comment on whether there ar establish mean for these term and if so whether thei character the

it determin that these definit will assist consum in maintain healthi dietari practic fda will proce with further rulemak to adopt the definit or to propos new on fda also state that if the agenc agre that such term ar nutrient content claim under the provis of the statut such claim would be prohibit after the effect date for final rule until such time as thei ar defin by fda by regul further fda state that if comment demonstr that there ar accept definit for these term and thei do not character the level of nutrient in accord with 101 65 d 1 such term would not be subject to section 403 r of the act unless us in a nutrit context in associ with an explicit or implicit claim or statement character the nutrient content of the food 25 sever comment maintain that the term high potenc high absorpt and balanc ar impli nutrient content claim and urg the agenc to defin or prohibit these term the comment state that it is inappropri and fraught with possibl for decept to allow each manufactur to defin such claim on comment state that although these term impli featur of nutrient content to consum thei do not have ani establish or us mean with regard to dietari supplement the comment argu that these term seem to be more specif to dietari supplement than to other food so that their applic in help consum make appropri nutrit choic from the varieti of food avail seem limit on the other hand sever comment state that these term do not inher refer to the level of nutrient ar not nutrient content claim and therefor should not be defin these comment maintain that such term ar formul descript which properli and truthfulli describ the natur and type of the product these comment contend that these term have been us for mani year and that consum have come to understand that product so describ provid an amount of the primari nutrient in the formul that is at least equal to the rda for those nutrient on comment argu that fda preced exist for exclud such term from regul as nutrient content claim the comment state that as formul descript these term ar us to consum in help them to make product choic and manufactur should be allow to continu to us these term in a manner that is consist with fda polici on claim such as maximum strength for intern analges in the over the counter drug review i e kept outsid the scope of thi rulemak the agenc agre that these term seem to have more direct applic to dietari supplement than to food in convent food form furthermor these term mai have some util in help consum select among dietari supplement howev while these term have appar been us for year to impli superior the agenc is uncertain what thei mean to consum the agenc disagre that these term should be regul in the same manner as term such as maximum strength which ar us on the label of over the counter drug product the over the counter drug regul includ maximum amount limit section 411 a 1 a of the act prohibit limit on the potenc of dietari supplement of vitamin or miner except on the basi of safeti therefor the situat ar not analog the agenc believ that each of these term should be evalu individu becaus thei do not seem to be synonym high potenc seem to focu on nutrient level or content but balanc as on comment suggest seem to be a formul claim high absorpt seem to focu on how the bodi respond to the nutrient the agenc will address each of these term in more detail in the comment that follow b definit for high potenc 26 the major of comment state that the term high potenc or full potenc is an impli nutrient content claim and should be defin sever definit were offer for thi term a few comment state that multivitamin and miner ar term high potenc when the major of nutrient with establish rda ar present at the level equal to or in excess of the rda similarli anoth comment state that the term should be restrict to formul that contain micronutri at level of at least twice the applic rdi or drv becaus a multivitamin at 100 percent of the dv might be high potenc compar to a food in convent food form but not high potenc when compar to other dietari supplement anoth comment suggest that fda should requir a high potenc singl ingredi supplement to contain at least twice the rdi and that the front of the label should disclos what multipl of the rdi the supplement contain the comment acknowledg that under thi scheme some nutrient such as calcium and selenium would not qualifi to carri a high potenc claim becaus thei ar rare sold at doubl the rdi the comment suggest that if the supplement industri begin to market those supplement at higher dose in order to make high potenc claim then fda could establish a lower minimum level such as 50 percent more than the rdi for selenium or 50 percent of the rdi for calcium those minimum level would appli to those nutrient onli the comment also suggest that fda should allow high potenc claim on multinutri supplement when more than on third of the nutrient that thei contain meet the minimum level requir for a high potenc claim and the label disclos which nutrient ar present at high level for exampl the label of a high potenc multivitamin could carri an asterisk next to the claim with the follow disclosur contain high level of number vitamin further the comment state that it is not reason to requir that all of the nutrient in a multinutri supplement be present at level that ar necessari for high potenc claim becaus mani nutrient ar not and should not be sold in such high dose for exampl the comment suggest that high potenc claim should be allow on a multivitamin and miner supplement that contain at least doubl the rdi of vitamin a c e b6 b12 thiamin riboflavin and niacin but smaller amount of vitamin d iron calcium magnesium zinc and copper the comment state that the latter nutrient ar typic sold at dose lower than doubl the rdi and mai pose a risk at high level fda ha review the comment and is persuad that high potenc is a claim that character the level of a nutrient and therefor meet the definit in 101 13 b of a nutrient content claim fda also is persuad by the comment that thi is a term that fda should defin in order to ensur that it will be us to consum in maintain healthi dietari practic howev given the rang and divers of the suggest definit the agenc is not prepar to offer a definit of high potenc at thi time fda intend to review the suggest it receiv on thi issu and base on inform receiv in comment issu a propos rule on an appropri definit of high potenc fda recogn that there is a need to provid thi definit as quickli as possibl therefor fda intend to act on thi matter as expediti as it resourc allow c definit for high absorpt 27 a coupl of comment state that the term high absorpt doe not refer to the level of nutrient but rather to bioavail or how effici the nutrient ar releas from the product and absorb into the bloodstream on comment state that high absorpt mean that the product meet the definit for high and that a high amount is digest and assimil anoth comment state that from a biolog viewpoint the extent to which nutrient ar absorb from food or supplement depend not onli on the chemic form of the nutrient itself but on the chemic environ present by the carrier food in which it is contain and on the physiolog state of nutrient need of the individu consum given these factor the comment state that it is difficult to provid a meaning definit of absorb on comment request that the label should disclos inform about the bioavail of the product anoth comment suggest that fda should allow label to make high absorpt or similar claim onli when the manufactur suppli bioavail data show that the product is better absorb than a standard supplement the comment state that the agenc should not allow thi claim on supplement that simpli meet or exce the unit state pharmacopei convent s usp or other standard for disintegr or dissolut becaus meet those standard doe not ensur that the product is well absorb the agenc agre that the term high absorpt gener refer to how well a nutrient is absorb into the system a product can be well absorb irrespect of the quantit amount found in the product accordingli fda find that high absorpt is not a nutrient content claim and thu will not defin thi term the us of thi term is subject to section 201 n and 403 a of the act howev the agenc expect that ani product bear a high absorpt claim will contain the nutrient that ar the subject of the claim in a form than can be readili assimil by the bodi in addit manufactur who make a high absorpt claim should have data avail to support the claim and should be prepar to make such data avail to regulatori offici on request failur to do so could lead the agenc to conclud that there is no basi for the claim and thu that it is fals or mislead d definit for balanc 28 a few comment state that balanc is not a nutrient content claim on comment suggest that balanc refer to the ratio of nutrient not the level and that the term can appli equal to product contain low or high quantiti of nutrient anoth comment state that there is littl need for fda to defin balanc becaus most multinutri supplement that ar current on the market do not contain nutrient in proport that would impair the absorpt or util of other nutrient the comment suggest that until research gain further inform on the most favor proport of nutrient in supplement the agenc should leav thi term undefin and therefor prohibit anoth comment suggest that balanc be defin as ani supplement contain from 50 to 150 percent of the rdi for each vitamin and miner compon of the product for which an rdi ha been establish the agenc is persuad by the comment that the term balanc doe not typic character the level of nutrient but rather that it is a formul claim that address the ratio of nutrient the term balanc mai be us in differ wai each of which relat to the formul of a product for exampl the term balanc mai refer to the assort of nutrient that ar present in a product or it mai reflect interact between the nutrient present such as spare effect or impair or enhanc of absorpt accordingli thi term doe not meet the definit for a nutrient content claim in 101 13 b therefor the us of the term balanc is subject to section 403 a and 201 n of the act and not section 403 r of the act the agenc will determin whether the us of thi term is mislead on a case by case basi e temporari suspens of the us of term 29 on comment state that us of the term high potenc high absorpt and balanc should not be suspend temporarili dure the rulemak process becaus such a suspens would result in unnecessari label cost anoth comment request addit time to comment on the definit of high potenc and suggest that until fda defin thi term the agenc should permit dietari supplement manufactur to continu to us thi term as it is current be us the comment suggest that as an execut agenc fda ha inher author to refrain from enforc a statutori provis in circumst in which the enforc would do more harm than good the comment argu that to the extent that high potenc is be us as part of a brand name and wa be us befor octob 25 1989 the 1990 amend permit it continu us in the brand name until fda ha defin the term section 403 r 2 c of the act the comment argu that there is no reason for fda to prohibit the us of a nutrient content claim while a definit is be develop further the comment note that an enforc moratorium would avoid the relabel problem that would aris if fda disapprov and then reapprov us of the term within a short period of time the comment state that fda will continu to have author to prohibit us of the term when such us is fals or mislead fda advis that it intend to defin high potenc as a nutrient content claim in a separ rulemak as quickli as possibl the agenc is postpon the date that it will appli thi final rule on nutrient content claim on dietari supplement until juli 1 1995 thi postpon is discuss in detail in the document on the date of applic for the nutrit label and nutrient content claim requir for dietari supplement found elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist fda intend to complet it rulemak on high potenc in suffici time to assur implement by the time that dietari supplement manufactur will be requir to compli with the nutrient content claim provis the agenc also advis that the term high potenc when us as part of a brand name would fall under section 403 r 2 c of the act if as the comment state it wa us as part of the brand name befor octob 25 1989 howev onc thi term is defin by the secretari it will have to be us in a manner that compli with that definit in addit us of the term in the brand name is subject to section 403 a of the act which prohibit the us of fals and mislead label irrespect of whether the us of the term in the brand name is exempt under section 403 r 2 c of the act as discuss previous the comment did not demonstr that there ar accept definit for ani of these term howev the comment have convinc the agenc that the term high absorpt and balanc do not gener character the level of nutrient accordingli the agenc conclud that these term ar not subject to section 403 r of the act 4 ag specif claim 30 on comment state that there ar product with brand name that impli that the product is especi us for a particular segment of the popul the comment argu that it would therefor be appropri for fda to requir that these special formula compli with clearli defin requir e g that thei contain high amount of particular vitamin and miner that ar need by the relev group anoth comment maintain that such name mislead consum becaus thei provid no explan for those special popul claim and that in mani case the supplement do not contain level of nutrient that ar appropri for the special popul name in the claim the comment suggest that fda should at the veri least requir label to provid an explan for these claim for exampl an explan for a product with a brand name impli that it is us for women might state that thi product is especi suit for young women becaus it contain 100 percent of the rdi for folic acid and iron and 30 percent of the rdi for calcium fda agre that product market for special popul group mai includ claim or brand name that can be mislead these claim and brand name seem to impli a particular benefit for certain subgroup of the popul and often do not disclos how or why thei meet the need of that particular subgroup disclosur of such fact would help to protect a product from be misbrand under section 403 a of the act becaus it label would reveal materi fact about the product s claim special us howev such claim about the us of a product for particular popul group gener fall under section 403 j of the act to the extent that thei repres the product to be for special dietari us as special dietari us claim thei ar outsid the scope of thi rulemak among other thing 105 3 defin special dietari us as us for suppli

underweight and overweight and u se for suppli particular dietari need which exist by reason of ag includ but not limit to the ag of infanc and childhood 105 3 a 1 i and a l ii the agenc intend to

subject to the gener misbrand provis of section 201 n and 403 a of the act 5 natur 31 sever comment suggest that fda defin the term natur for dietari supplement becaus that term is wide us in the label of dietari supplement even though there is no establish definit of that term and it is mislead as it is now us for exampl on comment state that studi indic that natur vitamin e d alpha tocopherol is better util than synthet vitamin e dl alpha and other tocopherol but that natur claim now appear on product contain synthet vitamin e mislead consum who think thei ar get a better util product the comment state that in other instanc compani us the term natur to mean that the product contain no artifici ingredi on comment acknowledg that fda ha struggl with how to defin thi term for food in convent food form thi comment suggest that the agenc need not resolv the dilemma at thi time but that it should simpli establish a supplement specif definit just as fda ha establish a special definit for natur flavor in 101 22 anoth comment suggest that fda should allow natur claim on product contain onli the natur occur form of a vitamin the comment suggest that fda could request comment about whether to limit natur claim to nutrient such as vitamin e that appear to offer some advantag when consum in a natur form the comment also state that mani consum will want the option of purchas other nutrient in the natur form as well fda is not persuad by the comment that the term natur should be defin at thi time as on comment acknowledg the agenc ha recent expend it resourc explor the us of thi term and it wa unabl to arriv at an accept definit 58 fr 2302 at 2407 fda current lack suffici resourc to thoroughli explor and develop propos regul for the us of thi term on dietari supplement

establish of such a standard and such a procedur is left to the secretari of the us depart of health and human servic dhh and by deleg fda thu in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33702 fda review the legisl histori of the 1990 amend to identifi the featur that congress intend would guid the agenc s choic of a scientif standard and procedur for regul health claim on dietari supplement fda identifi the follow featur that it believ should guid it choic o the regul ar to deal onli with the procedur and standard for health claim for the substanc in dietari supplement thei ar to have no bear on the avail of ani dietari supplement o the regul must prohibit the us of health claim that ar not author under their provis o the regul must ensur that ani health claim that appear in label ar scientif valid o the regul must ensur that ani health claim that appear in label ar understand o the regul should be such that all segment of the food industri ar treat fairli and in a consist manner unless there is an appropri basi on which to draw a distinct thi factor embodi a principl of equiti implicitli in the act 58 fr 33700 at 33703 with these featur in mind fda consid all of the approach of which it wa awar that might be us to regul dietari supplement the agenc tent conclud that it should adopt an approach that would subject dietari supplement to the same standard that appli to food in convent food form fda state that it wa it tent view that that approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the on hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other furthermor the agenc advis that if it adopt thi standard for dietari supplement all food will be regul under the same standard fda point out that under the same procedur that appli with respect to claim for substanc in food in convent food form there is a premarket review that ensur that the safeti of the substanc that is to be the subject of the claim ha been establish as well as the scientif valid of the claim a claim link a substanc to a diseas whether on a food in convent food form or on a dietari supplement is intend to increas intak of that substanc thu the agenc said it is import to ensur that a claim encourag such increas intak can be safe implement therefor fda propos to adopt the same procedur for health claim for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form 1 avail of dietari supplement 1 a great mani comment primarili from consum rais object that indic that the comment were misinform about the propos regul or that thei simpli did not believ what fda state in the dietari supplement propos mani of the comment express consider anger resent and even fear over the propos a larg number of these comment character the propos as an attack against the dietari supplement industri mani of these comment state that fda is plot to ban all dietari supplement a number of comment explain that the propos regul would limit the number of dietari supplement avail to consum by limit the amount of health inform that could appear on supplement label and thu diminish supplement market the comment maintain that fda propos polici of requir premarket review of a supplement s safeti is contrari to the agenc s state intent to preserv supplement avail and consum choic some of the comment maintain that mani manufactur would be put out of busi mani of the comment argu that the nation s health would be advers affect and that health care cost would increas without dietari supplement to maintain good health some comment contain testimoni that certain dietari supplement were respons for cure and prevent a varieti of diseas includ cancer howev a few comment point out that assert that fda plan to ban dietari supplement ar unfound a number of these comment predict that the vast major of dietari supplement will remain in the marketplac becaus about 80 percent of supplement label ar alreadi in complianc with the propos provis there is no basi for virtual all of the concern rais in the comment about the avail of dietari supplement noth in these regul will make them unavail to consum these regul focu onli on ensur that health claim if made on the label or in the label of dietari supplement ar scientif valid and understand thu the avail of dietari supplement will not be affect by these regul while it is like that some claim mai have to be remov from product label as a result of thi final rule the product themselv can continu to be market it is true that prohibit the us of claim that have not been author by fda mai have an advers impact on the market of some product howev ani such impact is outweigh by the need to assur consum that the claim that ar made in label ar scientif valid and that thei can reli on such claim in fact the onli product whose market will ultim suffer under these regul will be those whose label ha born claim that cannot be support by the avail scientif evid the requir that the agenc be confid that the presenc of a health claim will not result in unsaf intak of the substanc that is the subject of the claim is not inconsist with supplement avail and consum choic if a manufactur doe not choos to make a claim about a substanc noth in these regul will affect the manufactur s abil to continu to market supplement that contain that substanc fda believ howev that it ha an oblig to ensur that befor it author a claim that encourag consum to increas their consumpt of a substanc it have some assur that increas consumpt of that substanc will not be harm 2 fair and consist treatment of all segment of the food industri 2 mani comment assert that fda ha not been evenhand in it approv of health claim for us on dietari supplement and on food in convent food form some of these comment maintain that fda unfair treatment of dietari supplement is evidenc by the agenc s approv of health claim involv cancer and coronari heart diseas for us on fruit veget and grain product but not for us on fortifi food or supplement that provid fiber or antioxid vitamin the comment state that fda should author health claim involv particular nutrient for us on ani food that contain those nutrient includ dietari supplement unless there is signific scientif agreement that the claim is valid onli when the nutrient is consum in a particular form to ensur that such an approach is taken in evalu health claim for us on dietari supplement in the futur a few comment request that fda add the follow provis to the end of 101 14 g 21 cfr 101 14 g a health claim that ha been approv for ani substanc that is to be consum at other than decreas dietari level shall be permit on all food includ dietari supplement contain the requisit amount of that substanc unless fda determin that i there is signific scientif agreement as defin in subparagraph c that the consumpt of the substanc in the particular food will not provid the benefit claim or ii the food contain disqualifi amount of anoth substanc a few comment contend that fda also ha treat dietari supplement unfairli by withhold approv of a health claim concern the role of folic acid in reduc the risk of neural tube defect ntd simpli becaus of it concern that allow the claim on food in convent food form would rais safeti issu becaus of overfortif of the food suppli and the subsequ effect on certain subpopul these comment assert that the proper cours of action for the agenc would have been to allow health claim on dietari supplement but to prohibit their us on food in convent food form until the public health concern associ with such us had been resolv howev a few comment support fda decis to approv particular health claim for us on fruit veget and fiber contain grain while not author their us on dietari supplement or fortifi food with ad antioxid vitamin or fiber these comment note that there ar mani compound in fruit and veget that mai be involv in reduc the risk of diseas that mai not have been identifi the comment assert that befor allow a dietari supplement to bear a health claim author for us on food in convent food form it is import to establish that the supplement provid the same health protect benefit as the convent food fda disagre with the assert in the comment that it ha been unfair with the dietari supplement industri with respect to it approv of specif health claim fda believ that the health claim should be consist with the scientif evid avail to the agenc in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2537 2552 and 2622 fda explain why it wa author health claim pertain to 1 heart diseas and diet low in satur fat and cholesterol and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber 2 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber and 3 cancer and diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that mai contain fiber vitamin a beta caroten and vitamin c the agenc also explain in detail why it wa not author health claim pertain to ani specif nutrient i e heart diseas and dietari fiber cancer and dietari fiber and cancer and antioxid vitamin in the case of the antioxid vitamin fda found that although there wa suffici evid to justifi a health claim concern the relationship between diet low in fat and high in fruit and veget that mai contain fiber vitamin a and vitamin c and a reduc risk of cancer the avail evid did not provid a basi on which to attribut the reduct in risk of diseas to ani individu vitamin or combin of vitamin regardless of whether the vitamin is classifi as an antioxid or not see discuss under section iv 58 fr 2622 at 2633 yet becaus of the us of vitamin a as beta caroten and c and dietari fiber in identifi those fruit and veget that correl with reduc cancer risk fda identifi these nutrient as be characterist of the food associ with a protect effect ani on or a combin of these three nutrient can serv as the identifi marker moreov becaus fruit and veget ar also character by an absenc of fat and becaus of the identifi relationship of low fat diet to reduc risk of cancer fda highlight low fat intak as part of the dietari pattern associ with decreas cancer risk becaus the mechan of the protect effect of fruit and veget is not known and becaus it is not possibl to determin which of the nutrient or other compon in fruit and veget is caus the observ effect the health claim author by fda focus on fruit and veget as a class of food and their relationship to cancer risk and not on particular nutrient by requir that all character nutrient be identifi as characterist of dietari pattern rich in fruit and veget without specif attribut reduc cancer risk to a singl nutrient or singl type of nutrient antioxid vitamin fda made the claim consist with the scientif knowledg avail to it at the time it author the claim becaus of the rapidli evolv scienc base rel to thi topic howev fda ha continu to updat it evalu of the scientif evid and the degre of scientif agreement on the relationship between antioxid vitamin and cancer as part of these effort fda initi along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public confer on antioxid vitamin and cancer and cardiovascular diseas that wa held on novemb 1 through 3 1993 the transcript of that meet ha been submit to the docket as a comment on the antioxid vitamin and cancer rulemak along with other comment receiv in respons to the announc of the confer 58 fr 54595 octob 22 1993 fda is review the result of thi confer and other scientif evid that ha becom publicli avail sinc the public of the januari 6 1993 final rule on antioxid vitamin and cancer similarli in the case of heart diseas and dietari fiber and of cancer and dietari fiber the agenc found that there wa insuffici evid to attribut the reduct in risk specif to dietari fiber or to specif fiber compon the agenc did conclud howev that dietari fiber and solubl fiber along with other nutrient serv as us marker in identifi those food for which the scientif evid show that inclus in a daili diet wa associ with reduc risk of cancer and of heart diseas 58 fr 2552 and 58 fr 2537 for both topic area the agenc also note the

regard to heart diseas other compon variabl associ with solubl fiber in food e g lipid compon mai also contribut to a cholesterol lower effect fda found that the inabl to detect mani of the differ among fiber fiber compon and other substanc in food that contain dietari fiber includ solubl fiber and the gener lack of conclus as to the mechan of action of dietari fiber and fiber compon were limit factor on fda abil to draw conclus from the avail evid furthermor fda note that food high in dietari fiber ar also gener low in calori and total fat factor that ar associ with reduc risk of cancer fiber rich food ar also gener low in satur fat and cholesterol substanc that also affect the risk of develop heart diseas thu some or all of the benefit associ with diet high in fiber rich food could be the result of displac of fat and satur fat from the total diet rather than an effect of fiber per se the agenc state that although the specif role of the numer potenti protect substanc or displac of neg substanc e g fat satur fat and cholesterol in such plant food ar not yet understood popul with diet rich in these food experi mani health advantag includ lower rate of heart diseas and cancer thu fda did not author the us of a health claim on the associ between ingest of dietari fiber or specif fiber compon and a reduc risk of heart diseas or cancer instead for cancer fda to be consist with the avail scientif evid and prevail scientif agreement focus on fiber contain grain product fruit and veget as product class similarli for heart diseas fda focus on fruit veget and grain product that contain fiber particularli solubl fiber becaus of the us of dietari fiber or solubl fiber in identifi the type of food whose consumpt is most like to correl with decreas cancer or heart diseas risk these substanc can serv as identifi marker for select us food even in the absenc of adequ evid of a direct effect of fiber fda is awar howev of the rapidli evolv natur of the scienc base rel to these topic area fda intend to updat it review of the scienc by initi in the near futur along with other major research and health organ as cosponsor a public symposium on dietari fiber and heart diseas and cancer with respect to assert concern folic acid fda disagre that it should have allow health claim on dietari supplement while prohibit their us on food in convent food form while fda did not author a health claim for folic acid and ntd in the final rule on heath claim and label statement for folic acid and ntd publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2606 hereinaft refer to as the folic acid final rule the agenc did announc it plan to work expediti to author a claim if appropri the agenc note that the public health servic ph includ fda had recommend ref 7 that all women of childbear ag in the unit state should consum 0 4 milligram mg 400 microgram g of folic acid daili to reduc their risk of have a pregnanc affect with spina bifida or other neural tube defect fda acknowledg that thi recommend evidenc that signific scientif agreement exist regard a relationship between folat and ntd but said that there were factor that prevent fda from author a claim the agenc said that the act must be read as a whole and that section 403 r 3 a ii and 409 of the act 21 usc 348 reflect the proposit that the us of a substanc that is the subject of a health claim must be safe the agenc point out that the ph recommend state that there were signific question that persist about the safe us of folic acid in food as state in the folic acid final rule fda expect that the author of a claim would like result in signific increas in consumpt of folic acid by women in their childbear year and by the gener popul becaus manufactur would add folic acid to their product in order to claim that these product were us in reduc the risk of birth defect intak of multipl dose of folic acid from supplement and from it increas presenc in the food suppli could rapidli result in intak of 3 to 7 mg 3 000 to 7 000 g per dai 58 fr 2606 at 2614 such intak repres increas of 10 fold or more abov current intak in the folic acid final rule the agenc review the safeti consider rais by such increas in folic acid intak includ 1 potenti effect in person with poor vitamin b12 statu 2 potenti risk for person take medic that interfer with folat metabol 3 potenti risk for pregnant women becaus of uncertainti about effect of high blood level of folic acid on the embryo dure gestat and 4 uncertainti regard possibl interact between folic acid and other nutrient with increas folic acid intak the agenc conclud that it could not author a health claim on folic acid until the question regard the safe us of thi nutrient were satisfactorili resolv in the folic acid final rule the agenc describ the effort it wa undertak to address and resolv these concern follow public of thi document base on it review of the evid it discuss with an advisori committe and it review of the comment that it receiv the agenc tent conclud that the safeti problem rais by folic acid can be resolv by set a safe upper limit of intak of 1 mg folat per dai for all popul group the agenc announc it tent conclus in a propos to author a health claim on folat and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 octob 14 1993 in companion document fda also propos to amend the food addit regul for folic acid to specifi the food that could be fortifi with folic acid and the level at which thei could be fortifi 58 fr 53312 and to amend the standard of ident for specif cereal grain product to permit the addit of folic acid 58 fr 53305 thu base on thi review of the agenc s action it is clear that the nondiscriminatori provis suggest in the comment is not necessari when fda ha conclud that a substanc ha a relationship to a diseas fda ha act to author a claim see final rule on calcium and osteoporosi 58 fr 2665 and the propos rule on folic acid and neural tube defect 58 fr 53254 in the case of antioxid vitamin and cancer dietari fiber and heart diseas and dietari fiber and cancer the evid did not establish that the name substanc had an effect on the name diseas the evid show that these nutrient were mere marker of food that had been shown in studi to affect the risk of the diseas fda ha reflect the scientif evid in the claim that it ha author and propos to author ani other cours of action would be inconsist with the act becaus it would result in claim that were both not scientif valid and mislead b altern approach in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 fda advis that a varieti of approach had come to fda attent about how health claim for dietari supplement would best be regul under the 1990 amend these approach came to the agenc s attent by variou mean includ the comment on the health claim propos that address the most appropri method for regul dietari supplement testimoni befor congress about implement of the 1990 amend as well as the legisl histori of the 1990 amend fda carefulli evalu each of these approach to determin how thei compar with the characterist that fda ha list abov a number of comment address the agenc s tent conclus about these approach 1 us of advisori committe in the dietari supplement health claim propos see section ii b 1 58 fr 33700 at 33704 fda advis that it had tent decid not to adopt a committe base approach suggest in comment for evalu the valid of health claim on herb thi approach known as the botan ingredi review bir would involv the establish of expert panel under the direct of an oversight committe fda would particip as a nonvot member of the expert panel the oversight committe which would be charg with the respons of review all health claim petit pertain to herb or botan compon would reliev fda of all respons for initi review of these petit each expert panel would conduct an evalu of scientif data pertain to the request claim subject the evalu to peer review and prepar a final recommend about the claim the recommend and all support document would then be forward to fda and the agenc would be permit 120 dai to approv disapprov or modifi the report under draft regul prepar and submit for fda adopt by on comment on the health claim propos there would be a codifi presumpt in favor of the committe recommend the agenc base it tent decis about the bir on it belief that the suggest approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author on health claim becaus of thi presumpt in the draft regul submit by the comment under thi presumpt fda would be oblig to prove that the committe wa wrong if the agenc decid not to follow the committe s recommend in such circumst fda could be forc to propos to author health claim that it wa not satisfi were scientif valid fda note that there is no basi under the act for such a transfer also the agenc note that the creation of such a committe would be financi burdensom and state that it would be inappropri to commit it limit resourc to a committe with as narrow a scope as that suggest by the comment 3 a few comment address thi advisori committe issu some comment voic opposit to fda tent decis not to establish a bir these comment disput the agenc s assert that the establish of a bir would involv ani transfer of author note that fda would retain full and final discret in approv health claim the comment also disput fda find that the creation of a bir would be burdensom and costli in light of the agenc s limit resourc the comment state that such a find is inconsist with fda current us of advisori committe for veri narrow subject matter such as over the counter otc antiplaqu product circulatori system medic devic and drug abus the comment state that the us of a bir to help screen petit from the much larger herbal product industri would be an effici econom and scientif credibl wai to ration fda scarc resourc and would also help fda meet statutorili impos deadlin for action on petit that it might not otherwis be abl to meet the comment also assert that the agenc s statement that it ha the ultim respons to determin whether the petit for health claim is valid impli a mistrust of the integr of the bir process and the involv scientist and reveal an agenc belief that it is the onli author compet to judg the scientif valid of health claim for herbal dietari supplement the comment disagre with such a conclus and argu that health claim petit will onli receiv adequ and full consider from the scientif commun best qualifi to determin whether thei meet the signific scientif agreement standard set by congress through the creation of a bir which would repres the most compet and knowledg bodi in a field that remain larg esoter to fda on of these comment suggest that appropri select for herbal expert panel might includ experienc herbal practition who ar familiar with potenti advers reaction to herb as well as medic practition in foreign countri where herb safeti ha been studi by govern and industri panel the comment state that the inclus of foreign medic practition would be especi appropri dure the evalu of a claim whose merit ar agre upon throughout the world but ar not gener recogn in the unit state such as in the case of us peppermint tea for it sooth or carmin effect on the digest tract howev on comment support the agenc s tent decis not to adopt the bir process the comment state that fda could well be legal liabl for decis made by the bir that were later shown to have place the public health at risk sever comment call for fda to establish an advisori committe for health claim for dietari supplement where the committe would select expert panel respons for the evalu of propos health claim for all dietari supplement the comment suggest that the expert panel should be compos of scientist and health care profession with expertis on a given nutrient diseas relationship as well as nonvot industri and consum repres these comment contend that on reason for the agenc s slow in approv a health claim for folic acid ha been it relianc on advisori panel that were not suffici familiar with the research in the area and who had to be educ about the strength of the evid befor thei could act some of these comment suggest that fda could retain the author to reject the recommend of the committe as long as it publish it reason for do so anoth comment state that both the dietari supplement industri and fda have been slow to recogn and util a great deal of research that ha been done in the area of nutrit and health the comment attribut thi slow to a gap between the scientif commun fda and the dietari supplement industri the comment suggest that in order to close thi gap fda should form a committe of it lead scientist to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month or as requir to discuss the latest research in the area of nutrit and health publish in highli accredit scientif journal so that the research could be us to creat and support health claim petit the comment suggest that when the agenc committe and the industri reach an agreement on the data fda could author the us of a health claim on the nutrient diseas relationship on which there is agreement fda recogn that advisori committe mai make valuabl contribut in assist the agenc to evalu scientif evid about health claim in certain circumst for exampl the folic acid subcommitte of the food advisori committe provid valuabl recommend in support of fda propos to author a health claim for folic acid and propos to fortifi cereal grain product the agenc intend to continu it us of advisori committe wherev the need aris fda believ howev that it should retain the right to decid when the us of an advisori committe is necessari there mai frequent be circumst in which evid establish that us of advisori committe is not necessari becaus the evid show that the claim is clearli support or clearli not support in addit if the agenc were to establish a stand advisori committe for health claim fda would want it to have a broader focu than just dietari supplement fda view is that claim should focu on the substanc and not the food in which it is found becaus the primari issu is whether the substanc diseas relationship ha been establish thu if fda were to establish a stand advisori committe it would be on health claim in gener although a number of comment assert that fda lack knowledg of herbal product the agenc believ that it personnel ar fulli compet to evalu properli substanti petit concern health claim in thi area also if the agenc were to decid to establish an advisori committe it would take step to ensur that the membership of the committe had the necessari expertis includ pertin expertis on herbal product there is an implic in some of the comment that the evalu of the scientif evid support a claim is somehow differ depend on the substanc involv in fact whether a claim is for a vitamin miner herb or other similar nutrit substanc includ fat satur fat and cholesterol the skill need for evalu of a claim ar basic the same these skill ar found in epidemiologist nutritionist biostatistician clinician and expert in the diseas be address as well as in peopl awar of how the substanc is or should be consum thu fda doe not agre with the implic in these comment fda is interest in have commun with the dietari supplement industri howev the agenc doe not believ that it would be appropri for the commun to take the form of the suggest stand committe to meet with a similar industri committe everi 3 to 6 month while fda believ that regular commun with the dietari supplement industri is like to be us the process by which health claim ar author must be a more open and public process than that suggest by the comment certainli the 1990 amend envis a public process for claim for substanc in food in convent food form as reflect in section 403 r 4 of the act fda ha been present with no convinc reason why a similar process should not appli to claim for substanc in dietari supplement furthermor fda continu to believ that the bir advisori committe approach would involv a signific transfer of agenc author for health claim even though comment on the health claim propos and the dietari supplement health claim propos have made argument to the contrari the suggest regul for health claim that wa submit to fda on mai 10 1991 and refer to by the agenc in the propos that it ha issu state in part b if the committe determin that a propos health claim is appropri for a particular herb or botan either as propos or as modifi by the committe it shall forward it recommend s to fda togeth with all the data and other inform befor the committe when it made it decis c if the committe determin that on the basi of the data and other inform befor it the propos health claim is not scientif justifi for the herb or botan it shall so notifi the propos the propos mai then direct the committe to forward to fda all the inform befor the committe with respect to the propos togeth with it conclus and the reason therefor d within 120 dai of receipt of the inform describ in b and c abov fda shall either accept the recommend reject it or modifi it base upon the agenc s independ evalu

the record is view as a whole in favor of a committe recommend under either b or c emphasi ad despit assert to the contrari the last sentenc of paragraph d oblig fda to establish that the committe wa wrong in order not to follow the committe s recommend ultim therefor there would in fact be a signific transfer of author if the suggest provis were to be adopt by fda as fda note in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33704 there is no basi under the act for such a transfer of author fda doe not question that expert on an industri committe or panel on herb and botan could be help the agenc encourag firm to work through such group for thi reason fda revis the provis pertain to petit in the health claim final rule to clarifi that the agenc will consid all recommend by such committe and panel see 101 70 b fda recogn that those petit that have undergon an independ scientif review and receiv endors by qualifi expert group will like be well support petit and could be veri persuas to fda further fda is like to place consider weight on the recommend of outsid expert and it decis as to whether a petit should be grant could be influenc significantli by these expert although fda encourag firm to work through group of outsid expert the agenc would be concern if such group were heavili weight with medic practition as on of the comment suggest over relianc on such practition to the exclus of scientist repres other relev scientif descript impli that the herb ar to be us for medicin purpos fda stress again that health claim ar about the relationship of food rather than drug to a diseas or health relat condit 2 establish of an approach base on a more lenient or the same standard fda propos to subject dietari supplement to the same scientif standard and procedur that the statut provid for food in convent food form section 403 r 3 b i of the act the standard codifi in 101 14 c state c valid requir fda will promulg regul author a health claim onli when it determin base on the total of publicli avail scientif evid includ evid from well design studi conduct in a manner which is consist with gener recogn scientif procedur and principl that there is signific scientif agreement among expert qualifi by scientif train and experi to evalu such claim that the claim is support by such evid fda explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that it know of no standard and procedur for dietari supplement that would both be more lenient than the standard and procedur for food in convent food form and yet still have the characterist that fda consid necessari under the 1990 amend and their legisl histori the agenc state that it had tent conclud that a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act 21 us c 343 a 1 or that allow health claim base on the exist of substanti scientif evid even though signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim doe not exist would be inconsist with congress s desir to ensur that health claim that ar made on food includ dietari supplement ar scientif valid fda said that it wa concern that if it were to allow claim in the marketplac whose valid had not been establish these claim would undercut the credibl of those health claim that ar in fact valid the agenc said that if it were to allow such claim consum would be left littl better off and no less confus than thei were in 1989 befor the passag of the 1990 amend fda also express it tent view that the propos approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the on hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other 58 fr 33700 at 33706 4 a larg number of comment assert that fda should establish an approach base on a more lenient standard for dietari supplement some of these comment argu that such an approach is direct by congress and cite a statement of senat hatch on of the primari author of the 1990 amend that a more lenient standard for dietari supplement s is envis on comment argu that by provid for the establish of a separ standard for dietari supplement congress had implicitli reject the rigid standard of signific scientif agreement adopt for food in convent food form the comment assert that fda wa therefor bound by basic tenet of statutori construct to adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement as such an action would give mean to congress s instruct wherea the adopt of the propos standard would in effect render those instruct meaningless the comment note that court have tradition not interpret provis of a statut in wai that would render other provis superflu a number of comment state that us the same standard and procedur for dietari supplement as for food in convent food form is counter to the intent of the 1990 amend becaus congress intend to make more rather than less inform about the health benefit of dietari supplement avail to consum the comment assert that health inform about the effect of diet on diseas is particularli import to consum of dietari supplement in decid which product to bui sever comment argu that restrict thi inform on dietari supplement will deni million of american the inform that thei need to improv their health and to help reduc their risk of deadli afflict such as heart diseas and cancer the comment assert that such restrict will cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been save through diseas prevent some comment express concern that restrict the us of properli qualifi health claim base on preliminari evid would encourag inform hungri consum to seek inform about the health benefit of variou dietari supplement from sourc such as book and the media which mai be unreli and which ar not regul by fda these comment argu that adopt a polici that result in consum turn to inform that mai well be mislead or outright fals is contrari to the educ goal of the 1990 amend on comment stress that fda should assist consum by encourag them to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet lifestyl and other factor comment suggest that fda should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin all possibl for consum misunderstand or all element of risk associ with increas consumpt of dietari supplement a few of these comment advis that a more lenient standard would be appropri for dietari supplement becaus thei ar be sold to educ consum rather than to the gener popul some of these comment disput the argument that consum could be misl by a more lenient standard these comment note that consum continu to reli on health messag on product such as cigarett and condom despit the fact that the messag have chang over the year in respons to new scientif find other comment state that studi have indic that consum ar abl to us variou advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner sever comment assert that fda should allow the us of preliminari health claim on dietari supplement and food in convent food form becaus it allow their us on drug the comment state that fda propos revis of the pediatr us subsect of prescript drug label in the feder regist of octob 16 1992 57 fr 47423 would allow prescript drug that had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children to nevertheless be given to children provid that the drug efficaci claim were qualifi by the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish the comment state that becaus these drug had not been test for safeti and efficaci in children their claim would be preliminari at best and misbrand at worst howev mani comment argu against a more lenient standard and procedur for dietari supplement sever comment stress that the adopt of the propos standard and procedur is support by the legisl histori of the 1990 amend and the ds act on of these comment maintain that while the 1990 amend give fda the option of adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the congression record denot a major opinion in favor of fda appli the same standard to supplement that the act provid for convent food a number of comment also warn fda that hold dietari supplement and food in convent food form to differ standard for health claim would lead to consum confus as the health benefit of nutrient deriv from dietari supplement would be allow to be character as superior to the benefit of those same nutrient deriv from food in convent food form some comment assert that the creation of public confus would directli undermin the intent of the 1990 amend to clear up consum confus about health claim inform and would jeopard consum confid in exist health claim food label and the govern particularli public health offici anoth comment assert that adopt a more lenient standard for dietari supplement could also allow some supplement manufactur to make unsubstanti claim and undercut consum belief in the credibl of the entir supplement industri these comment assert that a singl univers standard would best prevent consum confus by ensur that health claim inform is uniform on all food sever comment support the same standard and procedur on the ground that it would ensur that health claim appear on the label of dietari supplement ar base on reliabl peer review reproduc evid a number of these comment state that becaus supplement unlik convent food ar taken specif for the health benefit associ with them it is especi import that health claim on these product be reliabl becaus more and more consum ar us these product in the belief that the product will protect their health the comment said that these consum were respond to the larg amount of recent evid indic that vitamin miner and other nutrient mai plai a role in reduc the risk of chronic diseas some comment caution fda that the failur to ensur that health claim on dietari supplement ar reliabl would leav consum open to fraud a few of these comment point out that mani consum do not have the scientif knowledg to judg the verac of label claim for themselv and presum that fda regul ensur that label claim ar properli substanti on of these comment warn that older american ar especi vulner to fraud thi comment point out that the elderli suffer disproportion from diet relat diseas read supplement label more often than other peopl ar more trust of salesperson and do less research than younger consum other comment warn that unsubstanti health claim can harm consum by induc them to consum product that ar inher unsaf to consum excess dose of some substanc or to forego more benefici form of treatment for a given maladi a number of comment insist that the propos regul will not restrict the flow of inform on nutrit and health to consum on of these comment state that roughli 80 percent of supplement label ar alreadi in complianc with the propos regul other comment note that educ materi ar not cover by the propos regul and that there ar mani avail channel through which inform can be freeli dissemin other than food label moreov on comment contend that supplement label ar neither intend nor current us to educ the public but instead serv to sell the product to which thei ar attach some comment state that appli the same standard to both convent food and dietari supplement would creat a desir level plai field for all food processor and manufactur on comment state the adopt of the propos standard will provid an atmospher in which all food manufactur can move toward the product of healthier food which will benefit the public health in fda reconsider of how best to regul dietari supplement on of the most signific issu ha been the issu of whether supplement should be regul under a more lenient standard or the same scientif standard as that establish by congress for food in convent food form despit assert by some that congress direct that a more lenient standard be establish the legisl histori of the 1990 amend doe not support such a posit to the contrari as other comment point out and as the agenc explain in the preambl of the health claim propos 56 fr 60537 at 60539 through 60540 the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2507 through 2509 and the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33703 congress did not intend that the agenc be forc to adopt a differ standard for dietari supplement instead congress gave the agenc the discret to adopt ani appropri scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement there wa noth in the comment that indic that fda doe not have thi discret inde as some of the comment point out there wa consider support in both the hous of repres and the senat for adopt of the same scientif standard and procedur for dietari supplement fda address the posit of member of congress on thi issu in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33703 senat hatch left no question about hi posit that fda should us thi flexibl to adopt the standard and procedur for dietari supplement that appear appropri to the agenc to adopt a more lenient standard howev other member of congress were equal clear about their posit that fda should not adopt a more lenient standard in the octob 24 1990 congression record at s 16608 ref 4 senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state it is my view that there is no reason to do anyth other than util the same procedur and standard for dietari supplement whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud further the hous of repres clearli did not support a more lenient standard for dietari supplement the statement of hous floor manag that appear in the octob 26 1990 congression record at h 12953 ref 2 state whatev approach the agenc take it must adopt a system that evalu the valid of ani diseas claim made with respect to these substanc it system must be base on consider of public health and consum fraud as in everi similar decis made by the agenc todai we fulli expect that the agenc s evalu of diseas claim made with respect to vitamin will be base on sound scientif principl there is a great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim the potenti is just as great for vitamin as it is for other product in our view vitamin and other substanc cover by thi provis should be subject to at least as strong a standard as is applic to other food that contain claim that the food will treat a diseas or health condit noth in the ds act or it legisl histori indic in ani wai that congress chang it posit about it goal of the 1990 amend with respect to prohibit mislead health claim and improv of the public health through us of valid and understand claim in food label ref 3 although congress left no question that the exact standard and procedur for the regul of health claim for dietari supplement is left to the discret of fda and although congress did not provid direct guidanc concern how fda should us thi discret congress did provid consider gener guidanc about the intent of the health claim provis of the 1990 amend in view of the fact that thi guidanc doe not distinguish between dietari supplement and food in convent food form fda consid thi guidanc to be applic to both type of food as point out abov in thi respons senat metzenbaum the other primari author of the senat amend state that whatev approach the secretari take he must establish a system that evalu the valid of health claim for dietari supplement he stress that the system must be base on the same consider that guid other agenc decis public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 4 the quot statement of the hous floor manag also stress that the agenc s approach to regul dietari supplement must be base on consider of public health sound scientif principl and consum fraud ref 2 in addit these quot statement make it clear that congress consid the us of inaccur or unsupport health claim on food label to be harm to the public ref 2 moreov mr waxman on of the hous floor manag state the follow in the juli 30 1990 congression record h5844 what we have sought to do is to permit health claim but onli health claim base on scientif valid inform and we hope by have that scientif valid inform upon which a claim can be made that health claim in the futur will be health and not mislead furthermor as the agenc point out in the januari 6 1993 feder regist 58 fr 2478 at 2526 by enact the 1990 amend congress sought to ensur that health claim would be scientif valid and not mislead see for exampl statement of rep madigan and statement of rep waxman ref 2 experi had shown that mani unfound health claim were be us on food statement of rep waxman ref 2 congress recogn the great potenti for defraud consum if food is sold that contain inaccur or unsupport health claim id statement of hous floor manag in respons to the high potenti for health claim to be mislead congress legisl that ani claim that is not consist with fda regul will misbrand a food section 403 r 1 b of the act state that a food is misbrand if it label or label contain a claim that expressli or by implic character the relationship of ani nutrient of the food to a diseas or a health relat condit unless the claim compli with regul promulg by fda 403 r 1 b emphasi ad by take thi approach congress chose to permit onli those health claim on food that fda determin to be scientif valid effect recogn that health claim ar so potenti mislead as to be inher mislead appli the same standard and procedur to health claim on dietari supplement as that that appli to food in convent food form will not affect the avail of ani dietari supplement will ensur that health claim that appear in label ar scientif valid and understand and will subject all segment of the food industri to regul in a fair and consist manner those comment favor the same standard and procedur for reason of fair control of consum fraud and convey of valid inform about diet and it impact on a diseas or health relat condit serv to reinforc fda conclus that the agenc s propos rule should be final as propos the agenc disagre with argument that us of the same approach for dietari supplement as for convent food would deni million of american the dietari inform that thei need to improv their health and therebi cost the nation million of dollar in health care expenditur that could have been avoid as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 in the absenc of adequ data to establish that health claim ar valid assert about cost associ with the lack of inform in food label and about the benefit of consumpt of substanc in dietari supplement ar highli specul and highli question fda doe not agre that it should place more weight on the potenti benefit of the health inform than on elimin the possibl of consum misunderstand fda must weigh the public health impact of permit a multitud of preliminari claim against the possibl that a signific portion of those claim will be determin to be not scientif valid the latter result would like produc a percept among mani consum that food label and health claim even those that ar valid ar not reliabl to the extent that as a result consum do not chang their dietari pattern to reduc their risk of diseas thei will be less healthi and there will be more needless death from diseas and more cost to the nation economi rather than less when fda made thi statement the phrase adequ data to establish that health claim ar valid wa intend to express the posit that until the valid requir of 101 14 c ar met cost assert about the benefit of substanc consumpt ar highli specul and highli question in gener prior to fulfil of thi requir there mai often be studi with a wide varieti of strength and weak indic that there mai or mai not be a valid associ between a substanc and a diseas or health relat condit in decid whether or not to author a claim fda must consid that while benefit mai accru from the avail of the claim there is a veri real possibl that signific cost mai accru if the claim is author prematur a few studi mai often be found about a multitud of associ and mani if not most of those associ will ultim be found not to be valid if fda were to permit preliminari claim about such a multitud of associ the agenc believ that ultim what would be lost is the confid of most consum in the valid of all claim that appear in food label fda believ that the cost to consum of such a situat would prove to be greater than the cost of not permit preliminari claim of greater signific howev is that needless death would ultim occur where consum would not chang their dietari pattern to adopt a more health diet the agenc believ that congress in it enact of the scientif standard in section 403 r 3 b i of the act struck what it believ to be an appropri balanc between the cost and benefit of claim on food in gener fda is not awar of ani reason to strike a differ balanc for dietari supplement fda would like to assur all affect parti that the agenc will move as expediti as possibl to permit health claim onc the scientif evid is suffici support to conclud that associ between substanc and diseas or health relat condit ar valid although some comment assert that claim base on a more lenient standard would not be confus becaus consum of dietari supplement ar more knowledg than the gener popul fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33705 that there is noth that limit the purchas of dietari supplement to knowledg consum the comment did not submit justif for fda to chang it posit in thi regard assert that us of the same scientif standard for dietari supplement as that establish for food in convent food form is counter to the 1990 amend becaus less inform about diet and diseas will be avail to consum ar not correct under the 1990 amend author health claim provid consider more inform about the effect of diet on diseas where the effect ar recogn as scientif valid than wa the case befor the passag of the 1990 amend in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 fda author claim with respect to 7 relationship see 58 fr 2537 2552 2622 2665 2739 2787 and 2820 also in the feder regist of octob 14 1993 58 fr 53254 fda propos to permit health claim concern the relationship between folat and the risk of neural tube birth defect admittedli other health claim ar not permit to appear on food label and label but congress clearli intend through enact of section 403 r of the act that onli valid health claim be permit with respect to concern that consum will be forc to seek inform about diet and health from unregul sourc such as book and the media if fda doe not author preliminari claim fda advis that it must implement the provis of the amend as congress chose to enact them the 1990 amend focu onli on food label and label fda cannot ignor it clear respons under the 1990 amend becaus of concern about the unregul sourc of inform that were mention in the comment moreov while such sourc of inform mai lead consum to seek out product contain particular substanc fda action will ensur that the label and label of those product contain onli scientif valid inform that can dispel ani misconcept creat by the unregul sourc with respect to other concern express by these comment the agenc believ that the specif requir element in the health claim that it ha author to date demonstr that the agenc is encourag consum to reduc their risk of diseas by chang their diet and lifestyl for exampl the specif requir in 101 72 c 2 a requir in part that a claim about calcium and osteoporosi make clear that an adequ level of exercis and a health diet ar need in addit to adequ calcium consumpt argument that the agenc should allow preliminari claim becaus of fda implement of the drug provis of the act have no merit assert about fda propos action pertain to pediatr us for drug label in 57 fr 47423 ar clearli wrong the agenc s propos action with respect to requir the statement safeti and effect in children have not been establish pertain onli to drug for which there is no agenc approv for ani pediatr popul to us the drug in point of fact the agenc propos to requir thi statement as a further warn that the product should not be us for pediatr popul thu thi action provid no support for author preliminari health claim as fda point out in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos 58 fr 33700 at 33706 make dietari supplement subject to the same scientif standard and procedur as for convent food doe not render section 403 r 5 d of the act superflu thi section requir that the agenc consid what procedur and standard respect the valid of claim ar most appropri thi is what the agenc ha done the fact that the agenc ha found that on balanc the standard and procedur establish for food in convent food form ar also the most appropri for dietari supplement doe not render the agenc s effort invalid or the underli provis superflu the agenc wa charg with exercis it expertis and discret and that is what it ha done 5 a number of comment provid specif suggest about the wai in which a more lenient approach could be implement some comment argu that the approach should be suffici lenient to permit market of dietari supplement without ani restrict some of these comment argu that dietari supplement need no stringent requir becaus dietari supplement could be adequ regul under the requir in section 403 a 1 of the act that the label of a food must be truth and not mislead other comment suggest that fda could requir a warn inform the consum that fda had not substanti particular claim appear on a product on comment suggest that substanti claim could be allow to appear within a specif advisori panel of the label while preliminari claim would be allow to appear onli outsid the panel anoth comment suggest that fda adopt a split label approach in which preliminari health claim would be allow but the agenc would have the right to comment upon them on the label on comment suggest that health claim for which there is substanti scientif evid but not yet signific scientif agreement be subject to a certif and notif procedur rather than rulemak proceed under the procedur suggest by the comment claim could be made for dietari supplement so long as 1 the claim expressli disclos the absenc of scientif agreement as to the relationship 2 the manufactur provid fda with a fulli document certif by a panel of at least three qualifi expert that there is substanti scientif evid support the claim and 3 fda doe not disapprov the claim within 90 dai of receipt of the certif when addit inform is need the 90 dai period could be extend an addit 45 dai under thi suggest altern fda would have an opportun to particip in the select of the expert panel on comment request that fda onli disallow the us of those health claim on dietari supplement that ar not support by ani evid and that it classifi all other health claim into on of five categori and allow for their us on product in conjunct with a code system indic to consum the level of substanti that the claim ha achiev the comment suggest that the highest categori be full substanti the second those claim that have a high degre of substanti as judg by non fda expert but that fda find to be not fulli substanti the third claim that have support in the form of doubl blind placebo control studi publish in peer review profession journal the fourth claim that ar support by some evid from in vitro studi anim studi or other studi that do not involv human and the fifth those claim support by anecdot evid in support of it call for variou approv level the comment state that simpli categor a claim as substanti or unsubstanti doe not accommod the realiti that full substanti of a health claim consist of cumul evid from mani studi the comment maintain that if fda were to place all claim that have not achiev full substanti into the same categori fda would not be provid a mean for the public to distinguish claim that ar nearli substanti from those that ar entir fals moreov the comment state that an agenc determin that a claim is or is not support by signific scientif agreement often reflect a polit decis rather than a scientif on the comment said that fda panel compris a veri small percentag of the scientif commun that other scientist often disagre with the panel find and that there even mai be differ opinion within the panel themselv the comment state that given these condit it is blatantli dishonest and mislead to the public for fda to make a gener declar that a claim is or is not substanti a few similar comment call for fda to devis a multilevel approv scheme for health claim on dietari supplement that would allow statement concern the tradit us of a product to appear on the label and would permit the label of a supplement that contain a substanc that wa the subject of a pend health claim petit to indic that the product wa under fda review for a health claim but not to indic the natur of the claim the comment state that the adopt of thi approach would encourag manufactur of product that qualifi onli for the tradit us or claim pend approv categori to gather perform and submit research inform to fda in order to reach higher approv level on comment suggest that fda allow manufactur to us facsimil of the fda seal in conjunct with the variou rate the comment assert that thi approach would encourag manufactur to come into complianc with fda regul quickli as the seal would becom valuabl market tool for which consum look when purchas supplement and the lack of a seal would becom a market disadvantag for a compani fda ha consid these altern standard and procedur suggest by the comment and find that none of them have the characterist that ar necessari to achiev the goal envis by congress in pass the 1990 amend previous in thi preambl the agenc conclud that congress intend that fda adopt a scientif standard and a procedur that ensur that health claim that appear in label ar scientif valid and understand none of the altern standard and procedur offer by the comment meet thi object on of congress primari concern in pass the 1990 amend wa the widespread us of health claim whose scientif valid had not been establish ref 1 the purpos of the 1990 amend wa to bring that situat under control the problem with the altern procedur offer by the comment is that rather than bring the us of claim on dietari supplement under control thei would ratifi the state of affair that caus congress to act as fda explain in the preambl of the dietari supplement health claim propos a standard for health claim for dietari supplement that is base onli on section 403 a 1 of the act or that allow health claim base on the tradit us of the supplement or the exist of substanti scientif evid but not signific scientif agreement about the valid of the claim would be inconsist with congress s desir to ensur that health claim that ar made on dietari supplement or on ani other food ar scientif valid fda point out that if such claim were to be permit consum would be face with a multitud of claim some valid and some not valid fda state that it would be unlik that consum could distinguish between valid and invalid claim although comment on the dietari supplement health claim propos assert that consum would not be confus by a multitud of claim the comment did not actual go further in address how consum would react to such a situat in food label more specif the comment did not provid data to resolv the question of whether consum would be abl to understand gradat of scientif reliabl of claim on food label or whether consum would in fact be left as confus as thei were befor passag of the 1990 amend while a number of comment did assert that some studi show that consum ar abl to us variou advertis claim about diet and diseas in a ration and benefici manner the studi were not actual submit in the absenc of the studi fda ha no basi upon which it can evalu the assert of the relev of the studi to food label in the absenc of evid to the contrari the agenc consid it more like that consum would be consider confus by a multitud of claim with differ degre of reliabl on of the purpos of the 1990 amend wa to end such confus see statement of mr waxman 136 congression record h12953 ref 2 therefor fda reject thi assert approach such as those involv a split label or the us of an fda seal would also not be consist with the congression desir for scientif valid becaus manufactur would still be abl to market dietari supplement with claim that were not scientif valid even if fda seal were be us to distinguish those claim that fda consid to be valid there would be a question as to whether consum would be abl to ascertain which claim were preliminari and which were not these approach would not restrict the number of health claim that were of question valid about which congress wa specif concern ref 1 thu fda ha conclud that it would not be appropri to adopt ani of the altern approach suggest by the comment 6 sever comment suggest that fda adopt the reason substanti standard us by the feder trade commiss ftc see ftc polici statement regard advertis substanti program 49 fr 30999 august 2 1984 the comment assert that under thi polici fda could allow manufactur to make claim provid that the natur of the scientif find is accur repres the degre of evid is not misrepres and the claim pass a rough cost benefit test the comment argu that thi polici would facilit harmon with the ftc regul govern the us of health claim in food advertis would allow consum to have access to truth nonmislead and reliabl label inform and would still allow fda to take action against those dietari supplement bear health claim that ar not properli substanti argument that fda should adopt for dietari supplement ftc approach for regul advertis ar not consist with congress expect for health claim while the ftc and fda ar work togeth to achiev as much consist in their approach to health claim as their respect statut allow adopt by fda of the ftc advertis substanti approach would not provid fda the confid congress intend concern the scientif valid of the claim specif as explain abov on of congress main purpos in pass the 1990 amend wa to ensur that health claim made in food label ar scientif valid no such assur of scientif valid is provid under the standard that ftc must emploi under that standard there must be some evid to support a claim but it need not rise to the level of establish the claim s valid thu the ftc standard is not adequ for health claim in thi context it is appropri to reiter fda respons to comment assert that it wa bound to follow case involv ftc regul of advertis in the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2528 although case involv ftc mai sometim be relev it is import to note that fundament differ exist between the regulatori scheme administ by the two agenc congress ha long recogn the divis of role between the two agenc ftc concentr on the interest of commerc and econom need wherea the object of fda is the health of the peopl ftc regul unfair competit and trade practic includ food advertis see for exampl 15 usc section 45 and 52 in contrast fda is a scientif agenc empow to regul the food label among other thing under section 403 r 3 b i of the act fda mai permit health claim on food onli if it ha determin that those claim meet the statutori test for scientif valid the law under which ftc oper do not includ a compar statutori standard thu it would not be appropri for fda to follow the case law involv ftc iii the final regul in light of the forego fda is subject dietari supplement to the same standard and procedur that appli to food in convent food form the agenc believ that thi approach strike the appropri balanc between the congression concern for consum fraud public health and sound scienc on the on hand and the desir to provid the consum with inform on the other thu the agenc is revis 101 14 and 101 70 to includ dietari supplement a definit in the health claim propos fda propos definit for health claim substanc nutrit valu and dietari supplement to serv as tool for clearli establish the scope of the type of claim that would be subject to the regul promulg under section 403 r 1 b of the act in addit the agenc propos a definit for disqualifi nutrient level to establish limit on the level at which certain nutrient that ar known to increas the risk of a diseas or health relat condit could be present in a food and the food would still be elig to bear a health claim see section 403 r 3 a ii of the act in the health claim final rule the agenc adopt definit for the term health claim substanc nutrit valu and disqualifi nutrient level that it revis in respons either to comment or to the ds act see 101 14 a 1 2 3 and 5 also fda adopt a definit for the term diseas or health relat condit although the term is us in the definit of health claim and the term serv to identifi on of the basic element of a health claim the agenc had not propos a definit for it the agenc ad thi definit to clarifi the coverag of the health claim provis see 101 14 a 6 becaus of the ds act the agenc reserv the question as to whether these definit would appli to dietari supplement the agenc also did not includ a definit of dietari supplement in the final rule becaus of the moratorium impos by the ds act in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda propos to adopt the same regulatori scheme for health claim for dietari supplement that it had establish for food in convent food form to effect thi tent decis the agenc propos to revis the definit of substanc to make clear that it cover both food in convent food form and dietari supplement and to establish a definit for dietari supplement fda receiv no comment on the former aspect of the propos therefor the agenc is adopt it as propos howev fda did receiv some comment on it propos definit of dietari supplement 1 dietari supplement fda propos the follow definit for the term dietari supplement propos 101 14 a 4 dietari supplement mean a food not in convent food form that suppli a compon to supplement the diet by increas the total dietari intak of that compon in the past fda ha taken a posit that the term dietari supplement appli onli to supplement compos of essenti nutrient howev fda did not propos to limit the definit in 101 14 a in thi wai becaus section 403 r 5 d of the act includ dietari supplement of herb substanc that gener contain few essenti nutrient in addit the legisl histori indic that the term other nutrit substanc could includ a number of substanc that have not been shown to be essenti or nutrient ref 4 7 on comment commend the agenc for propos a definit of dietari supplement that recogn that these food could have compon other than substanc known to be essenti nutrient the comment assert that the propos definit would appropri move supplement out of the food addit categori fda advis that the comment s assert that the definit move dietari supplement out of the food addit categori is not correct a dietari supplement as the definit recogn is a compound food that mai includ compound that ar food addit whether a compon of food is a food addit or not is determin under section 201 s of the act 21 usc 321 s not section 403 r of the act congress specif provid in section 9 of the 1990 amend that these amend shall not be constru to alter the author of the

of the act 8 a few comment request that the propos definit of dietari supplement be modifi to explicitli includ all herbal extract on of these comment assert that the definit should includ process or unprocess plant part bark leav flower fruit and stem as well as extract of essenti oil market as tea powder tablet capsul and elixir fda is adopt the definit of dietari supplement as propos thi definit is intention broad to cover the rang of substanc that under the legisl histori could be includ in a dietari supplement and could be the subject of a health claim the purpos of the definit of dietari supplement is not to defin the substanc that mai be elig to be the subject of a health claim but to defin the form in which thei ar to be sold to be subject to regul as a dietari supplement under the scheme that fda is adopt and that congress envis see ref 4 statement of senat metzenbaum the determin as to what substanc ar appropri the subject of a health claim is made on a case by case basi base on the factor set out in 101 14 b and the evid present to the agenc the agenc disagre with the comment in on respect howev tea ar food in convent food form and thu not includ within the

the refer daili intak rdi per serv e g mani breakfast cereal fda doe not agre that such food should be includ in the definit of dietari supplement as discuss in the preambl to the dietari supplement propos 58 fr 33700 at 33707 fda ha limit thi definit to food not in convent food form to reflect the approach taken by congress in the ds act the manag s statement for the ds act from the senat and the hous ref 3 clearli state that the moratorium on the implement of the 1990 amend appli onli to dietari supplement not in the form of convent food becaus food in convent food form were not cover by the ds act moratorium the health claim regul alreadi appli to them consequ fda believ that it will reduc confus about the impact of these regul if the agenc limit coverag of the term dietari supplement to food not in convent food form of cours food in convent food form that ar formul to supplement the dietari intak of nutrient will be free to reflect their characterist in their common or usual name e g vitamin and miner supplement cereal 2 nutrit valu in the health claim final rule fda defin nutrit valu as follow nutrit valu mean a valu in sustain human exist by such process as promot

about the impact of thi definit in conjunct with the preliminari requir in 101 14 b 3 i that the substanc that is the subject of a health claim contribut tast aroma or nutrit valu or ani technic effect list in 170 o and that the substanc must retain that attribut when consum at level that ar necessari to justifi a claim preliminari requir ar criteria in 101 14 b that have to be met befor a substanc will qualifi to be the subject of a health claim an indepth discuss of all preliminari requir follow in section iii b of thi document 10 some comment urg the agenc to broaden it definit of nutrit valu these comment urg the agenc to recogn that the process by which a nutrient promot health maintain proper bodili function and protect the bodi from the develop of chronic diseas or other health relat condit ar in and of themselv characterist of nutrit valu the comment note that the basic function of vitamin e for exampl relat to it antioxid properti in prevent cell damag by trap peroxyl free radic and inhibit the oxid of unsatur fatti acid also the comment point out that fiber doe not promot growth replac essenti nutrient or provid energi but that congress specif requir fda to studi the relationship between variou diseas and fiber some of the comment ask that the phrase prevent or repair the neg metabol consequ of life process be ad to the list of process that character the nutrit valu of a food to ensur that such compon can be the subject of health claim a few comment assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit howev on comment maintain that the definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement the comment support it posit by agre with fda statement in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 that the inclus of the phrase such as in the definit ensur that the three referenc process ar exampl of how a substanc mai confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list the comment that highlight fda us of the phrase such process as in thi definit is correct fda intend the three referenc process to be exampl of how a substanc mai confer nutrit valu rather than as an all inclus list of the function that provid such valu as fda explain in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2488 the definit of nutrit valu is intend to be veri flexibl the agenc incorpor thi flexibl in the definit becaus fda recogn that certain substanc can plai a major role in reduc the risk of certain chronic diseas and mai confer their benefit through a number of process fda believ that the agenc should evalu the nutrit valu claim for a substanc that is propos as the subject of a health claim as describ in a health claim petit on a case by case basi thi approach will best ensur that the definit retain it intend flexibl and doe not becom an unintent barrier to author for legitim health claim fda doe believ howev that thi preambl should provid guidanc concern how the agenc will determin if a claim nutrient diseas relationship deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc in gener the agenc will look for evid that the claim effect on diseas is associ with the normal mainten of human exist if the substanc is us to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit the action of the substanc is clearli beyond a normal mainten function and the health benefit would therefor not deriv from the substanc s nutrit valu such a substanc would be a drug note also that claim about classic nutrient defici diseas ar not health claim see 58 fr 2478 at 2481 fda recogn that mani of the benefit mention in the comment mai deriv from the nutrit valu of a substanc the agenc s broad definit of nutrit valu includ assist in the effici function of classic nutrit process and of other metabol process necessari for the normal mainten of human exist dietari fiber for exampl help to assur normal intestin transit time therebi provid nutrit valu by promot effici bowel function vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag with respect to assert that fda should revis the definit of nutrit valu to provid for claim about prevent of a diseas or health relat condit the agenc point out that the preambl of the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2501 through 2502 fulli address thi matter and conclud that a claim that a substanc can be us in the prevent diagnosi cure mitig or treatment of a diseas or symptom is inappropri for a food see section 201 g 1 b of the act and 101 9 k 1 21 usc 101 9 k 1 fda reach thi conclus becaus the relationship of a food or a food compon to a diseas is quit differ from that of a drug the comment make these assert did not provid ani basi upon which fda could conclud that the agenc s posit in thi matter should be differ for dietari supplement than for food in convent food form as fda explain in the preambl of the health claim final rule the surgeon gener s report on nutrit and health ref 5 point out that apart from classic disord result from dietari defici of essenti nutrient e g pellagra and niacin it ha prove difficult to demonstr causal associ between specif dietari factor and chronic or other diseas e g dietari fiber and cancer the report state develop of the major chronic diseas condit coronari heart diseas stroke diabet or cancer is affect by multipl genet environment and behavior factor among which diet is onli on albeit an import compon these other factor interact with diet in wai that ar not complet understood in addit food themselv ar complex thei mai contain some factor that promot diseas as well as other that ar protect the relationship of dietari fat intak to causat of atherosclerot heart diseas is a promin exampl an excess intak of total fat if character by high satur fat is associ with high blood cholesterol level and therefor an increas risk for coronari heart diseas in mani popul a higher proport of mono and polyunsatur fat in relat to satur fat is associ with lower blood cholesterol level and therefor with a reduc risk for coronari heart diseas becaus of these complex definit scientif proof that specif dietari factor ar respons for specif chronic diseas condit is difficult and mai not be possibl to obtain given avail technolog ref 5 11 sever comment argu that the definit of nutrit valu should includ level of nutrient that ar achiev onli through the us of fortifi food or dietari supplement sever of these comment referenc studi recent report in the new england journal of medicin that indic that vitamin e reduc the risk of heart diseas when consum at level that ar almost imposs to achiev through a convent diet but that can be easili and safe attain through the us of dietari supplement these comment assert that it would be inappropri for fda to categor the involv nutrient level of vitamin e as therapeut and to refus to consid approv a health claim simpli becaus the claim concern level of a nutrient abov that achiev in a normal daili diet a few of the comment support thi assert by note that the mechan by which vitamin e protect against cell damag when consum at normal dietari level is ident to the mechan by which it protect against heart diseas when consum at higher level the comment maintain that in case such as thi on the agenc should approv health claim for us strictli on dietari supplement provid that the nutrient is safe when consum at the level at which the claim effect is achiev and the supplement is intend to be consum to optim health rather than as a drug the comment support thi regulatori approach by note that the health benefit of calcium occur when the nutrient is consum at increas level that can be achiev through the diet or by supplement and state that vitamin e should not be treat differ simpli becaus the benefici level cannot be reach without the us of dietari supplement similar comment argu that fda should at least avoid establish a maximum level of a nutrient that is consid to be characterist of nutrit valu on of these comment note such an approach result in an extrem fuzzi line becaus the maximum level of a nutrient that is achiev in a diet vari wide from on individu to anoth as an exampl the comment point out that a person who eat ten orang or drink a quart of orang juic per dai get more vitamin c than is provid by most current market vitamin c supplement a few comment assert that there is much scientif disagr over what level of a nutrient ar nutrit with mani scientist contend that level much higher than the us recommend daili allow us rda fall within the definit a few comment request that fda explicitli express in it regul a polici that nutrit valu mai involv rel high level of a nutrient a few comment maintain that fda should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it ha proof to the contrari in support of thi posit a number of comment object to the us of niacin s effect on blood cholesterol level in the dietari supplement propos as an exampl of an effect that is not nutrit on of these comment question fda assert that niacin doe not exhibit cholesterol reduc properti when ingest at the level convention associ with it function as a vitamin the comment state that niacin s vitamin effect occur below the level of tissu satur and maintain that the excret of niacin when consum at higher level known to be associ with cholesterol lower effect doe not necessarili indic that tissu satur ha occur thi comment also disagre with the agenc s statement that the occurr of liver damag when high level of niacin ar consum indic that the effect of niacin at these level is not nutrit in natur the comment argu that it is quit possibl that niacin continu to have nutrit effect at these level but simpli is overload the bodi s normal metabol pathwai for rid itself of excess level of the nutrient the comment assert that while legitim safeti concern exist in particular case of excess nutrient intak fda should not us thi fact to conclud that high level of those nutrient ar inher nonnutrit in natur and ar instead pharmacolog other comment express the belief that noth in the propos regul would automat exclud high level of nutrient from the definit of nutrit valu and urg the agenc to includ such level in instanc where thei would benefit the public health these comment also agre with fda decis to review on a case by case basi whether the amount of a substanc is appropri as the subject of a health claim on of these comment state that such an approach would help to ensur that health inform about fortifi food and dietari supplement can be convei without trigger the drug regul fda doe not believ that it is necessari for the rule to explicitli state that nutrit valu includ rel high level of a nutrient as some comment point out the case by case approach which as state abov is intrins link with the preliminari requir in the provis of 101 14 b 3 i provid the agenc with consider flexibl with respect to high level of substanc in dietari supplement under thi approach fda ha not as a gener rule establish ani maximum level at which a nutrient would ceas to have nutrit valu furthermor the agenc advis that there is no basi for concern that fda would us safeti concern alon to conclud that high level of nutrient ar pharmacolog fda will not do so as some of the comment point out petit for claim that requir that high level of substanc be ingest should have no problem demonstr that the substanc ha nutrit valu where the mechan by which the substanc affect the risk of diseas at these high level is the same as the mechan by which it function as a nutrient at normal dietari level howev it will still be necessari as the agenc explain in respons to the previou comment for the petit to show that the substanc s effect on diseas is associ with the normal function of the human bodi e g the substanc could not be us to correct an abnorm physiolog function caus by a diseas or health relat condit in it respons to the previou comment the agenc acknowledg that vitamin e provid nutrit valu through it antioxid function of reduct of cell damag if there ar situat where it can be establish that thi same antioxid mechan affect the risk of diseas when the vitamin is consum at level significantli higher than normal dietari level such level would satisfi the requir in 101 14 b 3 i that a substanc retain it food attribut i e it nutrit valu when consum at level that ar necessari to justifi a claim fda doe not agre howev that it should presum that all nutrient function in a nutrit manner regardless of their level unless it ha proof to the contrari it would not be practic for the agenc to bear the burden of determin the mechan by which the claim effect is occur for each petit claim thu the agenc find that it is appropri to requir that petition provid the basi for why it is reason to conclud that the claim effect is nutrit and not pharmacolog howev the agenc doe not necessarili expect absolut proof on thi issu fda will evalu petit on thi issu on a case by case basi the agenc ha consid assert that the dietari supplement propos should not have cite the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin as an exampl of a high dose effect that is not nutrit fda ha again conclud that niacin is an appropri exampl becaus there ar signific indic that a nutrit mechan is not respons for the cholesterol lower effect that occur with high level of niacin intak when fda state in the dietari supplement propos that level of niacin necessari to produc the cholesterol lower effect ar far in excess of the level at which there is tissu satur for niacin s vitamin function the agenc wa attempt to explain that for niacin s function as a vitamin there is a level beyond which addit niacin will not provid addit function result for that vitamin the term tissu satur mai impli either thi type of situat sometim refer to as function satur or the type of situat refer to in on of the comment wherein the tissu is satur with a concentr of a substanc and more substanc could immedi spill out into the urin fda wa not attempt to assert that the tissu itself wa actual satur there is no question that addit niacin will be absorb by cell when the vitamin function satur level is reach in addit to the situat with vitamin function satur there ar other indic that the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin do not result from the same mechan as that present by it vitamin function vitamin function satur mai be achiev through dietari supplement with either of the two form of the vitamin nicotin acid or nicotinamid howev onli nicotin acid provid at high level the cholesterol reduc effect such effect do not appear with high level consumpt of nicotinamid ref 6 if the same mechan were involv with the vitamin function of niacin as with the cholesterol reduc properti of niacin both form of thi vitamin should have cholesterol reduc properti 3 health claim in the dietari supplement health claim propos fda did not propos to make ani modif in the definit of health claim in 101 14 a 1 health claim mean ani claim made on the label or in label

requir is fundament becaus both the compon of a food that is the subject of a health claim and a compon of a drug have a characteriz relationship to a diseas congress recogn thi fact by creat an except from section 201 g 1 b of the act in the definit of drug for food that bear a claim author under section 403 r of the act thu it is crucial to the continu viabil of the act itself that the choic of the test that determin whether a claim that character the relationship of a substanc to a diseas can be made be base on the appropri factor under the act that choic turn in part on whether the substanc is a food therefor fda ha reflect in 101 14 b 3 i the judici recogn characterist of a food in thi regard interest person should not presum that inclus of the phrase or ani technic effect list in 170 3 o in 101 14 b 3 i mean that substanc that mai be classifi within on or more of the categori of food addit in 170 3 o automat meet thi preliminari requir the classif within 170 3 o ar of a gener natur to reflect the us to which food ingredi ar put all of the classif pertain to the effect of the ingredi on food e g by affect the textur of the food rather than on the human bodi onli a substanc that is us for the technic effect in 170 3 o 20 that of a nutrient supplement ha the potenti to have a us effect in the bodi becaus of the characterist that caus it to be us in the food the nutrient supplement categori includ substanc which ar necessari for the bodi s nutrit and metabol process as the comment themselv recogn not everi compon of a dietari supplement ha such an effect in view of the agenc s broad flexibl definit of nutrit valu fda doe not find ani merit in argument that the provis requir that a substanc be a food should be remov to the contrari fda believ that these provis will benefit the public health by allow the agenc to devot it limit resourc for review of petit to those that ar appropri for consider under the health claim provis of the act accordingli fda consid these provis essenti element under the framework that it ha creat in it regul for the regul of health claim and fulli consist with the act fda disagre with the comment character of it action as an attack against dietari supplement fda believ that the combin effect of 101 14 b 3 i the preliminari requir that a substanc be a food and 101 14 a 3 the definit of nutrit valu will not present dietari supplement with ani unreason barrier for agenc evalu of potenti health claim for compon of these product without question these provis do restrict health claim to effect on a diseas or a health relat condit result from the nutrit valu of substanc howev as on comment point out the current definit of nutrit valu in 101 14 a 3 is broad enough to includ the function of most dietari supplement on observ that might bear make in thi context is that congress ha given the agenc a statutori structur with which to deal in relev part that structur divid the world of substanc that have a relationship to diseas into food and drug congress place the health claim provis on the food side of the ledger fda is charg with implement those provis in accord with the act and applic legal preced fda ha announc it intent to implement the health claim provis as flexibl as possibl but at some point the agenc simpli cannot be as flexibl as some of the comment have suggest at that point the agenc would start to erod the scheme that the statut ha establish for drug the agenc cannot do that if congress intend someth that goe beyond the scheme that fda ha establish in these final regul then what is requir is a chang in the law itself 16 mani comment object to the aspect of 101 14 b 3 i that requir that a substanc retain it food statu i e it nutrit valu when consum at level that ar necessari to justifi a claim almost all concern wa direct toward consumpt of substanc at level significantli higher than those present in the daili diet some comment urg fda to evalu propos health claim involv rel high level of nutrient on the ground that categor prohibit them would deni american benefici inform rather than educ them on how to alter their diet to achiev optim health other comment state that fda categor refus to evalu such health claim becaus of the nutrient level involv would directli violat both the proxmir amend and the congression intent behind the 1990 amend these comment note that the 1990 amend provid for the appear of health claim on food and state that subject to certain condit the proxmir amend s prohibit against regul a vitamin supplement as a drug sole becaus it exce the level of potenc which the secretari determin is nutrition ration or us guarante the regul of vitamin as food regardless of the level of nutrient that thei suppli the comment also state that congress envis the approv of such health claim as it wa awar that dietari supplement substanti in excess of the us rda were routin be consum by american and it chose to direct that fda conduct a review of antioxid vitamin cancer claim with dietari supplement in mind other comment further assert that fda wa attempt to circumv the proxmir amend and creat maximum potenc level for all supplement by establish an upper limit for nutrit valu fda doe not agre that ani conflict with section 411 of the act is present by a requir that to be the subject of a health claim the substanc must be a food that is consum primarili for it tast aroma or nutrit valu there is noth in the health claim final rule or in the regul establish by thi document that will affect in ani wai the avail of dietari supplement or consum freedom to choos to purchas them rather the regul that fda is establish ar intend to ensur that ani health claim that mai be made for dietari supplement ar scientif valid thi is what section 403 r 5 d of the act direct fda to do noth in these regul would necessarili prevent a supplement from bear a health claim when it contain a level of a substanc that exce the level achiev in the context of the daili diet to the contrari the final rule concern calcium and osteoporosi for exampl which wa publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2665 permit a calcium health claim for dietari supplement and requir onli that the supplement label advis consum in appropri circumst that there is no known benefit from consum more than 200 percent of the recommend daili intak for calcium section 411 of the act doe not author health claim for dietari supplement or in ani wai affect fda author under section 403 r 5 d of the act to regul such claim under section 411 a 1 b of the act fda mai not classifi a dietari supplement as a drug sole becaus it contain a vitamin or miner at a level that exce the level of potenc that the agenc determin is nutrition ration or us noth in these propos regul would do so absent a claim fda will not consid a dietari supplement to be a drug becaus it contain vitamin or miner at level abov those normal found in food howev a claim on a product is an indic of the product s intend us if a claim reveal that the product is intend for a us other than for it tast aroma or nutrit valu then noth in section 411 of the act would requir that it be treat as a food 17 mani comment address the circumst under which dietari supplement should be consid drug a number of these comment refer to the follow agenc statement in the health claim final rule comment 49 58 fr 2478 at 2501 a product that is intend for medicin effect that is intend for us in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas is a drug and not a food thu there is no basi under the act for fda to permit health claim for herb whose onli known us is for medicin effect health benefit of such herb mai appear in the label onli in accord with the drug provis of the act although a few comment agre with thi statement mani comment express categor opposit to the classif of ani herb or other dietari supplement as drug while most of these comment did not offer reason in support of their posit on comment express concern that such a polici would be ground for fda to categor ban all such supplement as unapprov new drug sever comment note that mani herb have tradition been us both as food and drug and ask for assur that fda would not automat regul such herb as drug other comment argu that herb should alwai be regul as food where thei ar consum for their nutrit valu some comment stress that intend us as state on it label should be the determin factor in decid whether a supplement should be regul as a food or as a drug as an exampl on of these comment state that a supplement market for a specif therapeut us e g a vitamin c tablet sold to cure cancer is appropri regard as a drug while a supplement sold to be taken over a period of time to reduc the risk of develop a diseas e g a vitamin c tablet sold to be taken daili to reduc the risk of cancer should be regul as a food the comment assert that thi approach is consist with fda determin that a supplement contain larg amount of niacin should be regul as a drug when consum to lower serum cholesterol anoth of these comment emphas that a consum s us of a legal label product should not have ani weight in determin whether that product is a drug as an exampl the comment note that fda doe not regul either fiber or water as a drug as long as their label doe not bear drug claim even though consum mai us them to facilit bowel movement or to prevent mitig or treat dehydr respect a few comment suggest that fda determin whether a substanc is a food or a drug by it chemic composit the comment assert that while the boundari between drug and supplement is fuzzi at time drug ar typic synthet molecul that ar of a uniqu and patent natur while dietari supplement consist of natur nonpatent materi anoth comment state that fda should exempt substanc taken to treat a symptom of a diseas from regul as drug as the act defin as drug onli those substanc us in the diagnosi cure mitig treatment or prevent of the diseas itself earlier in thi preambl fda explain that these regul do not affect the avail of dietari supplement again these regul affect onli the food label and food label fda ha no intent of ban all dietari supplement of herb or similar substanc as unapprov new drug fda will carri out it respons to regul inappropri claim but the agenc will not attempt to restrict the sale of dietari supplement to consum unless the supplement present safeti concern with respect to the specif word for us in label statement fda advis that statement that a product mai be effect in the cure mitig treatment or prevent of diseas will make the product a drug howev statement that a product mai reduc the risk of develop a diseas or health relat condit mai or mai not make the product a drug exactli how a substanc diseas relationship is to be character is on of the issu that the agenc will address in decid whether to author a health claim and how to ensur that the claim describ the signific of the substanc in affect the diseas or health relat condit fda point out that as a gener matter mere us term such as reduc the risk instead of prevent will not automat make a claim a health claim and not a drug claim fda will make a case by case assess base on all relev factor in determin whether a claim is appropri subject to the health claim regim the agenc also agre that the main focu in decid whether a product is subject to regul as a food or a drug is the intent of the vendor and not how consum us the product although how consum understand claim that ar made can be us to determin vendor intent fda advis that there is no provis in the act for the agenc to exempt statement about symptom of diseas from caus product to be regul as drug although such statement mai not be claim that the product will treat the diseas that caus the symptom the statement clearli pertain to the mitig of diseas by address the symptom caus by the diseas section 201 g 1 b of the act provid in part that articl intend for us in the mitig of diseas ar drug similarli there is no provis in the act for fda to exempt natur nonpatent materi from the definit of a drug in section 201 g of the act fda advis that it not true that all natur materi ar not drug it ha been estim that about 25 percent of the drug current prescrib by physician ar plant compound and that an addit 25 percent ar relat to plant therefor fulli half of the drug commonli us can be consid plant deriv such commonli us drug as digitali aspirin quinidin atropin and hundr of other were onc consid herbal thu the agenc find that it cannot reli on the distinct of whether a product is natur or synthet in decid whether it is a food or a drug 3 safeti section 101 14 b 3 ii provid that to justifi a claim for a substanc that is to be

the claim s propon as a prerequisit to fda evalu of the health claim to submit all the scientif data and other relev inform requir to demonstr safeti and law in accord with applic petit requir fda will withhold review of the health claim until it is satisfi on these point 18 mani comment object that the propos safeti provis ar unreason a few of these comment specif assert that herbal supplement would almost univers fail the propos safeti requir becaus most herb ar not gra for us as a dietari supplement ar not approv food addit and ar not the subject of prior sanction or ar the subject of prior sanction that have been waiv furthermor the comment complain that fda process for act on gra affirm petit is notori slow and extrem costli the comment maintain that the propos safeti requir would discourag manufactur from submit health claim petit for dietari supplement would delai the approv of such petit and could well amount to a total ban on health claim for certain dietari supplement the comment suggest that fda requir safeti determin onli for those substanc with no histori of safe us and provid that the absenc of known safeti problem will be suffici proof of safeti for substanc with a long histori of us other comment urg fda to be flexibl in it determin of safeti for substanc in dietari supplement a number of these comment stress the import of fda recogn that safeti can be determin sole through the histor us of such substanc some of the comment note that mani compon of supplement particularli herb have been us for hundr or thousand of year without safeti problem the comment also note that herb ar us safe throughout three fourth of the world as a princip mean of medicin the comment declar that regulatori author in great britain germani japan and mani other nation have research variou herbal supplement and found them to be safe when consum at the level of us like to be contempl under a health claim petit on comment also note that inform concern accur dosag indic contraind and qualiti control measur ar also avail in past edit of the us pharmacopeia and nation formulari these comment urg fda to accept all relev data on the safe us of herbal dietari supplement includ foreign studi and monograph that evid the safeti of these product on comment declar that fda is legal bound to consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state when review the safeti of herb on comment assert that fda should evalu the safeti of vitamin and miner in term of their effect on the normal popul and not on those consum with unusu condit or sensit the comment acknowledg that such consum need clear label ingredi statement as well as educ on food to deal with their problem the comment assert howev that these consum should be held respons for some degre of self protect the comment maintain that thi approach is consist with the agenc s polici on person with allergi to food compon a few comment assert that the safeti of a dietari supplement should be defin in term of whether or not harm mai occur under the condit of us defin by the supplement s label rather than in term of an arbitrari cutoff such as the rdi the comment maintain that a systemat review of all compon of dietari supplement is not necessari and suggest that the agenc undertak safeti review on a case by case basi where it believ a potenti safeti concern might exist sever comment assert that fda is not equit in it concern for the safeti of dietari supplement as compar to the safeti of other product regul by the agenc some comment assert that the safeti record of dietari supplement is far better than mani fda approv food addit such as aspartam against which accord to the comment the agenc receiv and ignor thousand of consum complaint annual other comment assert that fda intens interest in the safeti of product would be better focus on prescript drug which ar respons for over 1 2 million death annual as compar to the no or few death attribut to the consumpt of dietari supplement howev sever comment support fda propos to requir that petition for a health claim for a substanc in a dietari supplement demonstr that the substanc is safe and law the comment agre with the agenc that such a requir is implicit in the act and that the label law in no wai diminish fda respons to ensur the safeti of food fda conclud that the preliminari requir that the safeti of a substanc be demonstr should appli to substanc in dietari supplement in the same manner that it appli to substanc in food in convent food form the amend to the act enact by the 1990 amend cannot be implement independ of the remain portion of the act see section 9 of the 1990 amend the act must be consid as a whole and fda respons for ensur the safeti of food is explicitli provid for in other section of the act see section 201 s 402 a 1 and 2 and 409 of the act as the agenc explain in the dietari supplement health claim propos the fact that the act contain such explicit safeti author is particularli signific becaus the agenc will be specif author the health claim that will be made in view of thi affirm action fda author of a health claim place the agenc s imprimatur on the claim moreov the claim will encourag consumpt of the substanc it would be a violat of the agenc s respons under the act to author a health claim about a substanc whether it be in a dietari supplement or in food in convent food form without be satisfi that the us of the substanc is safe certainli fda would have almost no assur that it would be protect the public health if it permit as some comment suggest all substanc except those that ar actual known to caus safeti problem to be the subject of health claim it would be a great and tragic ironi if substanc that were the subject of health claim becaus of on effect caus injuri becaus of anoth thi is the situat that congress sought to avert by includ section 403 r 3 a ii in the act fda preliminari requir is fulli consist with the principl that underli that section the fact that some herb and other ingredi of dietari supplement have been us for thousand of year doe not necessarili justifi a conclus by fda that their us under all condit is safe but it mai first fda need a basi for conclud that such us wa in fact without harm effect second fda need a basi for conclud that consumpt of ingredi in a supplement carri a health claim would be in amount compar to those consum safe in the past the propon of claim for such substanc ar certainli free to demonstr that the us of those substanc is gener recogn as safe base on their common us in food prior to 1958 the agenc note howev that the us of mani of these substanc ha been primarili as a drug tonic or folk remedi rather than as food see 53 fr 16544 at 16545 mai 10 1988 thi fact is confirm by some of the comment summar abov as drug the level and frequenc of us of these substanc mai have been significantli differ than the level and frequenc of us that will result from their us as food although the agenc will consid evid involv herb usag outsid the unit state fda still need to review data on the ident of the substanc the safeti of the substanc the us of the substanc in food the

it to be safe would certainli be relev and should be submit to fda it is import howev that as much of the evid that provid the basi for the countri s determin as is possibl be submit to fda although formal recognit of safeti by fda admittedli can be lengthi and expens such formal recognit is not requir under thi preliminari requir in respond to concern rais by comment suggest that fda recogn

submit with petit for health claim and mai us it discret to accept without formal affirm the independ determin of gra where fda believ that such action would be appropri as fda point out in the previou comment howev the agenc would not be fulfil it respons under the act if it were to permit a substanc to be the subject of a health claim without satisfi itself that the us of that substanc is safe although fda will consid all manufactur independ gra determin where the basi for such determin ar submit with petit for health claim the agenc advis that it will gener not be possibl for fda to judg whether gra determin base on complex scientif evid ar valid within the short timefram mandat under the 1990 amend for health claim petit instead agenc agreement with an independ determin that a substanc is gra will be most like where the substanc is an ingredi or a compon of a food ingredi that wa in common us in food prior to januari 1 1958 in a similar context howev where such agreement occur the agreement doe not constitut gra affirm instead the histori of common us in food coupl with the fact that fda know of no reason to question the safeti of the food ingredi mean that the

2478 at 2503 under thi final rule thi statement is fulli applic to substanc in dietari supplement the agenc believ that thi polici on independ determin that a substanc is gra demonstr that fda will be flexibl in assess conform with the safeti preliminari requir fda disagre with assert that the agenc should evalu the safeti of dietari supplement in term of onli the normal popul it would be unconscion for the agenc to adopt a polici of ignor advers effect some of which could be life threaten of ani food includ dietari supplement on vulner segment of the popul furthermor there is no basi under the act for such a polici fda doe attempt howev to find the most practic solut to assur consum of a safe food suppli for exampl the agenc gener doe not base safeti decis on atyp popul subgroup

forego reason fda is make health claim for substanc in dietari supplement like claim for ani other food subject to 101 14 b 3 ii c scientif standard 19 mani comment express concern that fda would appli the term signific scientif agreement in an unreason manner by demand too much support evid on substanc diseas relationship befor approv health claim sever comment insist that fda is misinterpret the requir for the scientif standard for food in convent food form as well as for dietari supplement the comment assert that the law doe not requir that there be signific scientif agreement that a nutrient diseas relationship ha been conclus establish but onli that the statement made in a claim be support by the avail evid as an exampl on of the comment assert that the requir of the law would be fulli met by a properli qualifi label claim such as although no scientif consensu ha been establish sever clinic studi suggest that daili consumpt of vitamin c as part of a well balanc diet mai reduc the frequenc of cold a number of comment assert that the standard for author health claim on food ar more stringent than those author the us of drug claim sever comment argu that fda is be unduli restrict by requir that manufactur perform expens random doubl blind placebo control test to prove the valid of a claim under the propos regul these comment state that such requir would deter manufactur from seek new us for herb and other substanc us in dietari supplement the comment maintain that a more lenient standard would encourag manufactur to engag in research to develop more health product the comment further assert that the dispar treatment of food and drug is especi unfair when the enorm differ in safeti factor between dietari supplement and untest prescript drug is consid some of the comment assert that fda had not been fair to date in it evalu of health claim under thi standard on of these comment assert that fda had approv onli four of the ten congression propos health claim not seven as fda claim in the preambl to the propos regul some comment maintain that fda should not requir a unanim or near unanim consensu among expert in order to find that there is signific scientif agreement concern a claim a few of the comment point out that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend clearli indic that such a level of agreement is not to be requir other comment urg that fda consid the requir for signific scientif agreement to be satisfi as long as there is agreement among a major of scientist familiar with the research in a given area these comment note that commission kessler offer testimoni support thi interpret befor the us hous of repres subcommitte on health and the environ other comment maintain that the requir for signific scientif agreement onli requir agreement among a signific number of qualifi expert on of these comment request that fda includ a provis in the regul that the standard of signific scientif agreement is not on of unanim to prevent confus among manufactur and consum a few comment ask that fda regul includ a provis that guarante that signific scientif agreement will be consid to have been achiev when a credibl health author particularli an agenc of the us govern recommend the consumpt of a nutrient becaus of it relationship to a diseas or health relat condit on comment suggest that fda not us the phrase signific scientif agreement to evalu propos health claim despit it inclus in the languag of the 1990 amend becaus the mean of the phrase is ambigu the comment suggest that fda should simpli consid the total of publicli avail scientif evid to determin whether or not a particular health claim can be justifi fda disagre with assert that it is conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda doe not requir that manufactur perform control clinic trial to prove the valid of a claim to the contrari as discuss in the health claim final rule 58 fr 2478 at 2506 the scientif standard for health claim is less stringent than the requir for approv of a new drug in the case of a new drug section 505 d 5 of the act 21 usc 355 d 5 state that the secretari shall refus to approv an applic for

that it is not conduct valid assess for health claim in an unduli restrict manner fda agre that the legisl histori of the 1990 amend make clear that congress did not intend in call for signific scientif agreement about the support for a claim to requir that such agreement repres a full consensu among scientist the hous report ref 1 state the standard doe not requir that there be a unanim agreement among expert instead there must be a signific agreement among expert but it doe not requir that everi expert in the field approv or agre with the claim the agenc share the comment concern that a requir of consensu would mean that some valid health claim would not be author and by restrict such claim would counter congress intent that health claim support by a signific scientif agreement be made avail to consum the agenc never intend to requir that claim be support by a consensu among scientist and ha not done so the agenc is sensit to the comment percept that the scientif standard particularli the phrase signific scientif agreement is subject the agenc believ howev that ani standard involv the evalu of scientif evid and opinion deriv from that evid must be somewhat subject fda in propos not to defin signific agreement among expert in the novemb 27 1991 56 fr 60537 at 60548 propos note that each situat mai differ with the natur of the claim substanc diseas relationship the agenc believ that in decid whether signific scientif agreement about the valid of a claim exist it is necessari to consid both the extent of agreement and the natur of the disagr on a case by case basi the hous report ref 1 make clear that congress intend the signific scientif agreement standard to be a flexibl on by point out that in review scientif studi fda mai give greater weight to the studi that it find more persuas the hous report also clarifi that the overrid consider in assess whether to author a claim should be the secretari s level of comfort about the valid of the claim the agenc believ that thi clarif provid clear guidanc for the applic of the standard and thu it is not incorpor the chang request by the comment in the codifi languag of the regul fda doe not believ it ha in ani wai been unfair in it approv of health claim to date earlier in thi preambl in respons to comment 2 fda explain why certain specif health claim were not approv nevertheless the agenc s statement in the dietari supplement health claim propos that it had author claim on 7 of the 10 nutrient diseas relationship is correct in the case of 3 of the relationship howev the claim were author for food rather than specif nutrient in these case as explain previous although there wa suffici evid to attribut certain diseas risk reduct to the consumpt of certain food and those food ar mark by signific level of the nutrient in question there wa insuffici evid to attribut ani diseas risk reduct directli to consumpt of the nutrient themselv fda doe not agre that it should defin

whose import for good nutrit ha been gener accept to remedi thi situat fda is propos to establish rdi for these nutrient fda is not propos to chang the rdi level for those nutrient for which it ha alreadi establish rdi fda recogn that there is activ debat within the scientif commun as to the basi on which such level should be establish and therefor the agenc consid it prematur to modifi it current level howev fda believ that at least the list of nutrient for which it ha rdi if not the rdi level themselv should reflect scientif consensu therefor fda is propos to establish rdi for seven addit nutrient ii author for addit label refer valu section 2 b 1 a of the 1990 amend state that nutrit label inform shall be convei in a manner that among other thing enabl the public to understand it rel signific in the context of a total daili diet in the legisl histori of thi provis congress state that thi provis requir the secretari to specifi requir that would permit the consum to understand the nutrit inform pertain to a particular food in relat to recommend dietari inform h rept 101 538 101st cong 2d sess 18 1990 thu fda ha requir that a present of the percent of the daili valu of the nutrient list in the nutrit label be a fundament part of the nutrit label format see 58 fr 2079 at 2123 through 2135 given the approach that fda ha taken it is clear that the more nutrient for which rdi or drv ar clearli establish the easier it will be for consum to understand inform about that nutrient in the context of the total daili diet in the rdi drv final rule fda state that over the last 20 year there have been signific advanc in scientif knowledg with respect to essenti nutrient requir 58 fr 2206 in 1980 na establish esaddi valu for vitamin k biotin pantothen acid copper manganes fluorid chromium selenium molybdenum sodium potassium and chlorid for the first time ref 3 these suggest intak valu were base on less complet scientif data than the rda valu and were regard as more tent and evolutionari ref 3 in 1989 na updat the valu for vitamin k and selenium make them rda rather than easddi ref 2 at that time na continu to provid esaddi valu for manganes fluorid chromium and molybdenum but drop the suggest valu for sodium potassium and chlorid give instead estim minimum requir for healthi person at variou ag thu given the us of rdi valu in convei the inform that congress ha said should be convei by nutrit label and given the fact that na ha develop the basi for rdi that ar not includ on the current list fda tent conclud that it is appropri to establish refer valu for these seven nutrient iii the need for chang under 101 9 c 8 that becom effect mai 8 1994 onli those vitamin and miner for which fda ha establish label refer valu mai be list in the nutrit label of food in convent food form fda propos to take a similar posit with respect to nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner 58 fr 33715 june 18 1993 sever comment on the dietari supplement propos argu howev that becaus rda or esaddi have been establish by na for vitamin k selenium manganes fluorid chromium molybdenum and chlorid manufactur of dietari supplement of vitamin or miner should be allow to declar these nutrient in product nutrit label with an asterisk in the percent daili valu column the comment suggest that the asterisk refer to a footnot state no daili valu ha been establish base on it consider of these comment and becaus the format that fda propos for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner provid for the list of quantit amount for vitamin and miner in contrast to the format for the nutrit label of food in convent food form which provid for onli a list of the percent of the daili valu for each vitamin and miner provid by the food fda provid for the list of these nutrient in the manner that wa suggest by these comment in the final rule entitl food label requir for nutrient content claim for dietari supplement of vitamin miner herb and other similar nutrit substanc publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist howev as an ultim matter fda consid thi solut to be defici in two respect first even on dietari supplement of vitamin and miner thi solut provid no basi for a declar of the percent of the daili valu for these nutrient inform that is as state abov import for consum in put the inform present in the nutrit label in the context of the total daili diet second the agenc s action with respect to dietari supplement of vitamin and miner doe noth to provid inform on the level of these nutrient in food whose label is subject to 101 9 moreov the comment on the propos rule on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33731 point to a third type of problem creat by the lack of refer valu for the nutrient in question sever of those comment request that nutrient content claim be allow for all vitamin or miner for which na ha establish rda or esaddi these comment could not be readili accommod howev becaus as explain in the final rule on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist fda regul defin term such as high and good sourc base on the rdi or drv for the nutrient that is the subject of the claim thi approach ha the advantag of link nutrient content claim to establish refer valu that provid a consist quantit basi for the claim howev becaus the agenc s current list of rdi and drv doe not reflect the entir list of nutrient for which dietari recommend have been establish no claim can be made about nutrient whose essenti is gener recogn unless the list of nutrient with rdi is updat as quickli as possibl thu fda is propos to establish rdi for vitamin k selenium chlorid manganes fluorid chromium and molybdenum for three reason first it will permit the declar of these nutrient in the nutrit label of all food second it will permit consum of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner as well as other food that contain these nutrient in signific amount to understand the amount of these nutrient present in these product in the context of the total daili diet third it will permit nutrient content claim to be made for these nutrient on all food iv the propos rule a basi for rdi for vitamin k selenium chlorid manganes fluorid chromium and molybdenum fda ha determin that na rda ar an appropri basi for label refer valu strong and uniform support wa provid for the us of na rda dure the initi develop of label refer valu in 1972 as well as in respons to the juli 1990 propos and the supplementari propos the agenc continu to believ that these establish nutrient allow ar the most wide accept and respect sourc of inform on human nutrient requir and recommend intak in propos rdi for these seven nutrient the agenc recogn that if it adopt thi propos some label refer valu will be base on the 1968 na rda while other will be base on the 1980 and 1989 na rda the agenc believ howev that provid label inform regard the seven addit nutrient cover by the propos would be us to consum in make healthi dietari choic as discuss in the previou section without rdi there can be no percent daili valu express for these nutrient on the nutrit label and nutrient content claim cannot be made for them therefor fda tent conclud that the advantag of have a refer valu for all nutrient that na ha found to be essenti outweigh ani disadvantag that deriv from the fact that some of these valu ar more reflect of current scientif think than other as state abov na is in the process of reevalu the basi on which rda ar determin na is consid whether valu should be select to prevent defici or to promot optim well the agenc believ that ani action to establish a set of rdi with consist deriv should await complet of the na process fda is commit to work with na to help resolv thi issu b determin of refer amount for vitamin k selenium chlorid manganes fluorid chromium and molybdenum base on it consider of comment on the 1990 propos and on the supplementari propos fda determin in the rdi drv final rule that there is consider support for the gener approach of establish label refer valu for vitamin and miner by select the highest na rda valu from among those for person 4 or more year of ag exclud pregnant and lactat femal 58 fr 2206 at 2211 the comment state that vulner or at risk group would be suffici cover by select the

children 4 or more year of ag exclud valu for pregnant femal and lactat femal 58 fr 2206 at 2211 fda refer to thi approach as the popul coverag approach fda is propos to us thi approach in adopt rdi

identifi as salvag in 21 cfr part 211 these inquiri suggest that identifi statement for salvag drug should list the transport compani from which the drug were salvag as the point of origin fda believ that thi kind of busi oper cannot meet the requir of the cgmp regul nor can it oper in a manner consist with pdma requir e g that a wholesal distributor give a wholesal distributor purchas a statement of origin for the product be sold fda view is that the requir for a statement of origin is design to permit prospect purchas to determin if the sourc of a drug is a legitim sourc such as an author distributor or secondari distributor licens by the state as a wholesal distributor the agenc believ that an origin unknown statement or a statement that a particular shipment of prescript drug origin as salvag or that thei came from a lost shipment from unknown person at an unknown time would not be consist with the mean of that provis thu in fda view us of an origin unknown or salvag statement would not meet the requir for an identifi statement under section 503 e 1 of the act 5 state licens of wholesal distributor pdma establish a requir that ani person engag in the wholesal distribut in

increas over the last 20 year and that the propos reduct in the minimum requir milkfat and total milk solid content of evapor milk is inconsist with the intent of the standard of ident for evapor milk as well as the intent of the subsequ amend that the milkfat and milk solid not fat content be reason relat to those of the milk us in the manufactur of evapor milk the agenc disagre with the comment accord to data suppli by the us depart of agricultur usda ref 1 the composit of produc milk ha remain fairli constant through the 1970 s and the 1980 s these data show that the yearli averag milkfat content for all produc milk befor standard for beverag purpos dure the period 1970 to 1991 ref 1 rang between 3 64 percent and 3 68 percent with an overal averag of 3 66 percent the agenc doe not agre that the chang in composit requir is inconsist with the intent of the evapor milk standard throughout the histori of the evapor milk standard the label of evapor milk product and the instruct materi pertain to the us of the food suppli to consum by food manufactur trade associ and usda ref 2 as well as polici statement by fda have describ the food as a 2 to 1 concentr of milk instruct on the label or in label of evapor milk frequent show that the food is to be dilut with an equival portion of water for us in prepar of beverag made us the food in addit recip for other food often state that a can of evapor milk mai be dilut with a can of water for us in recip call for the addit of milk ref 2 the standard of ident for milk in 131 110 21 cfr 131 110 defin minimum composit requir for the food of not less than 3 25 percent of milkfat and not less than 8 25 percent of milk solid not fat the minimum composit requir for evapor milk that fda is adopt in thi final rule i e not less than 6 5 percent of milkfat 16 5 percent of milk solid not fat and 23 percent total milk solid correspond to a twofold concentr of standard milk and thu ar directli relat to those of milk becaus the chang in composit requir accur reflect the gener understand that evapor milk is a twofold concentr of milk the agenc find that the chang in the evapor milk standard is consist with the intent of the standard and therefor is revis the standard as propos 2 the comment disagre that the test result that adpi submit from a monad i e singl product evalu in home us test were a reliabl indic of real consum prefer the comment state that monad rate ar not accept by organ such as the nation advertis divis of the better busi bureau to support product compar claim fda acknowledg the comment s concern that adpi in

the other two test each particip wa abl to evalu both product fda ha review the studi that adpi submit ref 3 the agenc conclud that there wa suffici evid to support adpi claim that consum were unabl

of consum the studi examin a wide varieti of possibl consum us of evapor milk in realist everydai situat addition these were separ studi emploi within subject and between subject design that came to ident conclus base on all of the evid in the petit the agenc find that it can conclud that consum ar unabl to discrimin between standard evapor milk and the evapor milk manufactur to conform to the suggest paramet 3 the comment state that the overwhelm us of evapor milk is in recip and that it wa not awar of anyon reconstitut evapor milk for beverag us in the unit state the comment question whether consum consid evapor milk to be a 2 1 concentr of fluid milk and whether the amend would make reconstitut for beverag us more conveni the agenc agre that evapor milk is us primarili as an ingredi of other food fda note that evapor milk mai be us in recip as manufactur or in reconstitut form as a direct replac for milk anoth signific us of evapor milk is in coffe and tea ref 4 although the common consumpt of reconstitut evapor milk as a beverag is decreas ref 5 and 6 evapor milk doe replac fluid milk for beverag purpos in individu household as a result of commerci purchas as well as through the usda commod distribut program in institut and by particip in the usda supplement food program for women infant and children ref 4 in fact on comment from a consum state that he and hi famili have us evapor milk regularli in food recip in coffe and in the prepar of beverag milk evapor milk ha been tout as a 2 1 concentr of milk for mani year ref 7 a 2 1 concentr is easier for consum to reconstitut than a 2 3 1 concentr becaus it is in whole unit in addit as note abov a 2 1 concentr when dilut result in a product whose composit is the same as that for beverag milk therefor fda conclud that provid for a 2 1 concentr of milk under the standard of ident for evapor milk is in the best interest of consum and that the concern rais by the comment ar without merit 4 the comment argu that a chang in the standard of ident for evapor milk is unnecessari becaus consum that want a lower fat lower cholesterol evapor milk can purchas evapor lowfat milk or evapor skim milk fda note that consum mai continu to purchas evapor lowfat milk or evapor skim milk howev comment from a manufactur of evapor milk that were submit in support of the propos state that mani of it custom have express an interest in lower fat and lower calori food and that the amend would afford it the comment manufactur the opportun to meet the demand of thi segment of the public furthermor the fat reduct although modest is consist with the surgeon gener s report on nutrit and health ref 8 and the nation academi of scienc report on diet and health implic for reduc chronic diseas risk ref 9 which recommend that consum reduc their consumpt of fat and cholesterol therefor fda find that the amend standard will benefit consum fda also note that the nutrit benefit is onli on of sever base that support the amend standard therefor fda conclud that the argument rais by the comment is without merit 5 the comment note that the propos reduct in the minimum requir milkfat content and milk solid content in evapor milk would make the us standard of ident for evapor milk inconsist with the intern codex standard for evapor milk fda acknowledg that the amend standard is not ident to the intern codex standard for evapor milk the codex standard requir that evapor milk contain not less than 7 5 percent of milkfat and not less than 25 percent of total milk solid becaus the new requir in the standard that fda is adopt will establish lower valu for minimum milkfat and minimum total milk solid content than those of the codex standard for evapor milk product compli with the codex standard will meet fda standard of ident us export of evapor milk mai need to reformul their product if thei ar to be ship to countri that requir that the food compli with the minimum requir of the codex standard but thi fact provid no basi for not make the propos chang in the standard accordingli after consider of all comment the agenc is amend the standard of ident for evapor milk in 131 130 a by reduc the minimum milkfat content requir from 7 5 percent to 6 5 percent by weight reduc the minimum total milk solid content requir from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight and establish a minimum

npdwr for lead in public drink water ref 4 2 on comment assert that there is no safe threshold for lead in drink water and becaus technolog resourc and knowledg make it feasibl to measur lead in water at the 0 002 mg l level fda should establish the allow level for lead in bottl water at that level the comment contend that becaus larg water compani have been test for lead and report lead level of 0 0 001 0 002 0 003 and 0 004 mg l to epa the pql is substanti lower than 0 005 mg l the comment state that anoth organ which ha limit resourc and is not in the busi of suppli water commerci us a

should review thi standard in a few year becaus epa 1991 rule for lead in drink water ha led to increas analysi for lead in water and us the best avail methodolog mani laboratori can now routin measur

most bottler ar routin meet the 0 005 mg l standard for lead a requir for test each lot of bottl water for lead is not necessari furthermor the major of the comment argu that test each lot of bottl water for lead would impos a signific financi burden on the bottl water industri for exampl comment from two trade associ repres bottl water manufactur maintain that a requir for test each lot of bottl water for lead would impos addit annual cost that thei estim at 15 000 for a small bottler and 300 000 for a larg bottler under the current good manufactur practic cgmp regul for the process and

thu the court conclud that the induc cancer determin had been made even befor the april 1990 order significantli the court also reject on the ground that the induc cancer find had alreadi been made epa refus to revok the phosmet and mancozeb food addit regul epa had argu in the februari 1991 order that becaus the carcinogen classif of phosmet wa tent and becaus epa special review would address the cancer risk pose by mancozeb immedi revoc of either set of regul under the delanei claus wa inappropri the court conclud howev that epa ongo review of data relat to the carcinogen of phosmet and mancozeb cannot countermand the applic of the delanei claus in light of the 1988 declar never revok that both of these pesticid ar carcinogen ref 26 the objector also advanc a somewhat circular argument to support their claim that epa never provid the opportun to challeng it 1990 induc cancer find the objector argu that thei never had the opportun to challeng epa induc cancer find becaus epa reli on the de minimi theori to deni the request to revok the regul and epa never propos the revoc of the regul essenti the objector ar suggest that although thei ar irrepar injur by the more recent

clearli had substanti inform concern what that reread of the tumor slide would disclos befor the expir of the period for object to the april 1990 order the report submit by the independ pathologist reveal that 1 dupont scientist reread the tumor slide initi and present their conclus to the independ pathologist for review ref 29 2 the independ pathologist receiv a project sheet for the tumor

prepar a report on the reread of the tumor slide by both the dupont scientist and the independ pathologist that report explicitli state that the scientist find were given to manag on mai 18 1990 ref 32 thu dupont s own submiss show that the thi evid is not new in ani event even assum that dupont somehow did not know the result of the reread of the tumor slide until the june 19 1990 complet date by the exercis of due dilig dupont should have know by mai 25 1990 dupont wa put on notic in june 1989 by the california petit that the question of benomyl s carcinogen wa at issu when dupont did contract for an independ evalu of the tumor slide that independ evalu appear to have been complet in roughli 2 month ref 33 thu there is no reason thi inform could not have been prepar prior to the

summar and address below 1 concentr dupont and the mancozeb task forc have object to the revoc of the benomyl toler on raisin dupont and the mancozeb toler on raisin and bran of wheat dupont and mancozeb task forc on the ground that these food addit toler should be revok becaus there is no concentr of residu for these pesticid in these process food under exist epa polici epa doe not consid food addit toler necessari unless residu of a pesticid concentr dure process and therefor could exce the raw food toler dupont and the mancozeb task forc contend that the respect benomyl and mancozeb regul ar not necessari under thi polici and epa must make a determin on the concentr issu prior to reach the delanei claus question dupont ha also request a hear on the question of whether benomyl concentr in tomato product epa disagre with the objector on both legal and practic ground first these object and hear request suffer from a basic flaw a challeng to an order under ffdca section 409 must go to the legal of the agenc s order ref 41 argu that there is an altern ground for a revoc action base on inform or claim not resolv by epa in the revoc doe not challeng the legal basi of the revoc here epa revok the benomyl and mancozeb toler on the ground that these toler ar bar by the delanei claus that wa the sole issu address by the juli 1993 order epa did not address whether the toler were need due to a concentr of residu dure process except to mention the irrelev of the issu to that order unlik the induc cancer issu the question of whether benomyl concentr dure process wa not an essenti element of the juli 1993 order the objector appear to be contend that even when epa find that a toler violat the core safeti standard in ffdca section 409 epa is legal bar from act on that find prior to determin whether there ar some other ground for revok the toler dupont claim that t he agenc must make a threshold determin if a 409 regul is necessari befor even reach the question of the applic of the delanei claus ref 42 dupont cite three reason why such a threshold determin is mandat none ha merit dupont first argu that if data demonstr that there is no concentr of residu in process food there is no reason to retain the 409 food addit regul ref 43 true there mai be no reason under epa exist polici or given the flow through provis of section 402 to retain such a food addit regul but the regul would not be bar as a legal matter by the flow through provis the flow through provis simpli creat a safe harbor for residu in process food which ar at or below the section 408 raw food toler thu revoc of a food addit regul where the pesticid doe not concentr in the process food is driven by polici not legal consider second dupont assert that a threshold determin on concentr must be made becaus of the taint attach to the delanei claus find thi reason mai explain why dupont seek revoc on anoth ground howev as state abov it is not legal support for requir epa to first make a concentr determin final dupont claim that reli on the delanei claus ground to revok the toler mai caus fda to misalloc it enforc resourc becaus of public fear about cancer even assum thi to be true thi reason is again noth more than a polici reason for reli on lack of concentr rather than the delanei claus the mancozeb task forc make similar polici argument as to why epa should revok the mancozeb food addit toler on concentr ground like the argument of dupont the task forc s content do not attack the legal basi for the revoc at bottom dupont and the mancozeb task forc ar object becaus epa ha not taken action on their later petit to revok these toler on lack of concentr ground epa is act on the on food addit toler mancozeb on raisin where epa had data which had alreadi been review show that the toler wa not need under exist polici epa howev ha not yet act on the portion of the petit file by dupont and the mancozeb task forc which ar inadequ support by data or ar premis on a chang in a longestablish epa polici epa see no error in act first on the california petit sinc it wa submit nearli four year prior to the dupont and mancozeb task forc petit epa deni dupont s and the mancozeb task forc s object to epa failur to revok these toler on concentr ground and dupont s hear request on the same issu becaus thei do not attack the legal basi of the juli 1993 order none of the polici argument made by the objector convinc epa that it would be appropri to delai respond to the california petit until the issu surround their petit can be resolv 2 the classif of raisin as a process food dupont ha object to the revoc of the benomyl food addit toler for raisin claim that that toler should be revok becaus raisin ar not a process food but a raw agricultur commod dupont argu raisin toler should be establish under section 408 not section 409 thi object is deni for the same reason as the object involv the concentr issu propos an altern ground for revoc base on inform or claim not resolv in the revoc doe not attack the legal basi of the juli 1993 order similarli epa doe not believ that it is oblig to rule on dupont s petit to reclassifi raisin prior to rule on the california petit given that dupont s petit wa file 4 year later 3 procedur object sever of the objector have rais variou relat procedur object to epa juli 1993 order becaus these alleg procedur error all involv epa determin on the induc cancer question and becaus each of the objector ar preclud from relitig that issu epa believ if it commit ani error the error wa harmless nevertheless becaus the object rais call into question the oper procedur of both epa and fda over the last 40 year epa will respond to them in some detail the objector basic complaint is that follow the decis in le v reilli

the regul that fda is consid for propos would specifi the requir that the agenc believ ar the minimum necessari to ensur that food product under fda jurisdict ar not adulter under section 402 a 4 of the act under the program that fda is consid if a food purveyor cover by the program doe not adopt and implement a haccp plan that compli with the program s requir or doe not oper the plan in accord with the program food prepar pack or held in that facil would be adulter under section 402 a 4 of the act and potenti subject to regulatori action by fda d rational for a haccp approach fda expect that adopt of haccp by some or all segment of the food industri coupl with govern verif through inspect of the haccp system will more effect and effici ensur the safeti of the american food suppli the agenc ha tent chosen a haccp approach becaus haccp address the root caus of food safeti problem in product storag transport etc and is prevent two princip altern to haccp exist end product test and comprehens current good manufactur practic cgmp regul end product test doe not address the root caus of food safeti problem it is not prevent by design and requir that a larg number of sampl be analyz

would be need to cover effect such a divers industri and the time requir to implement such regul howev fda mai consid the promulg of cgmp for certain food process or type if such regul would be more effect than a haccp system for such process for exampl some of the comment have suggest that sanit would be better address through cgmp than through a haccp plan a haccp system for food safeti assur ha numer distinct advantag includ the follow 1 haccp focus on prevent and is design to prevent hazard from enter food 2 haccp permit more effect and effici govern oversight 3 haccp place primari respons for ensur food safeti appropri on the food manufactur distributor and 4 haccp assist food compani in compet more effect in the world market the primari purpos of ani haccp system is to prevent problem through the systemat analysi and control of the product system by industri thi analysi and control would be confirm by govern verif of the industri s monitor as such a haccp approach provid an appropri balanc between the respons of industri and govern in ensur food safeti a haccp base program will also allow fda and it state and local govern counterpart to conduct more effici and focus inspect of food facil in addit to be prevent in natur and more effici a haccp approach offer two addit benefit over convent inspect techniqu first in contrast to fda current regulatori approach a haccp approach requir industri to analyz in a ration scientif manner it product process in order to identifi ccp and to establish critic limit and monitor procedur an essenti part of the industri s role under haccp is to establish and maintain record to document adher to the critic limit relat to the identifi ccp which will result in continu self inspect second haccp allow the regul to monitor more effect a firm s complianc with food safeti law with it current system of inspect fda can determin the condit at a food plant onli dure the period of inspect the agenc must therefor make assumpt about condit befor and after the inspect base on a snapshot of plant condit and practic at the time of the inspect with an haccp base program in place an investig can determin and evalu both current and past condit critic to ensur the safeti of food produc by the facil as discuss abov an essenti part of a haccp system is mainten of monitor record by examin such record the govern inspector can in effect look back through time at the condit of a facil under the propos that fda current envis the agenc would have access to ccp monitor record to verifi that the haccp plan is work govern monitor under a haccp system would provid assur that system of prevent control ar in place and function properli and thu afford greater public assur of food safeti current feder inspect and surveil strategi attempt to gaug the industri s knowledg of hazard and prevent control measur larg by infer i e whether a compani s product ar in fact adulter or whether condit in a plant ar in complianc with cgmp consequ the current inspect system place a great deal of respons on govern regul to uncov problem and to take regulatori action to address those problem under a haccp base inspect system it would be the respons of the compani to develop a plan for produc safe food and the role of govern inspector would be to verifi that the compani is carri out it plan final adopt a haccp system could potenti

commiss encourag the intern us of haccp provid further support for fda seriou consider of a haccp program for all or part of the food industri e how the agenc intend to proce fda began it initi to mandat haccp with a propos cover the seafood industri due in larg part to the fact that a substanti amount of work on the applic of haccp to seafood process and import includ the develop of specif haccp model ha alreadi been done by the feder govern some state academia and by the seafood industri itself thu there is a consider bodi of literatur and expertis which can facilit the develop of haccp system by seafood processor and import moreov seafood industri repres have been urg the feder govern to adopt a mandatori haccp program the nation fisheri institut the largest seafood industri trade associ ha testifi repeatedli at congression hear in support of legisl that would mandat such a system the agenc recommend that interest person refer to the seafood propos to understand how the haccp approach might work with respect to on categori of food product the bodi of knowledg and experi on the applic of haccp to food product ha not as far as the agenc is awar been develop for other commod to the extent that it ha for seafood on possibl except is the low acid can food industri where much work ha been done in haccp applic due to fda long stand regulatori program for thi industri moreov the food industri is extrem divers and complex for these reason fda ha decid to issu thi advanc notic of propos rulemak to request comment on variou aspect of the implement of a mandatori haccp
