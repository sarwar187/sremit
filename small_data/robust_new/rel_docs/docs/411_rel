set ey on someth that ha never been seen befor he sai the first time i saw the titan wow there it wa thi monstrou ship just came out of the gloom and there it wa for ballard the moment of discoveri is intellectu kinet an instant when he connect palpabl with histori the best experi that i can give that s sort of an analog is like go to custer s last stand he sai to go and stand where custer stood and imagin you know bad dai to be in the cavalri that s the sens it s your hallow ground you sens crazi hors there and you just realiz the hopeless of the situat well when you re out at the titan and all of a sudden it happen right here it s no longer abstract unknown territori scientif and histor ha been ballard s countri for more than two decad perhap even as far back as hi childhood in southern

the 47 year old seem to be in the throe of anoth transform thi time around he appar is eager to shape both the futur and the past with the technolog that he develop in more than a decad of underwat explor furthermor he plan to us hi new tool as the new host of nation geograph explor a weekli two hour program produc by nation geograph and turner broadcast system inc it is the kind of popular of scienc that ballard ha been critic for in the past by hi peer but ballard sai he see hi metamorphosi into tv person as an educ mission that mai help convinc children that scienc is a contact sport discuss the search for the bismarck ballard obvious savor the contact with histori and scienc becaus the bismarck wa engag in a run battl hundr of mile from land when it sank neither the british nor the german were abl or much interest in keep precis record of their locat so ballard s expedit had to search about 150 squar mile of ocean floor initi with sonar and then with remot control computer robot sensor and camera control from a surfac ship befor locat the wreck june 8 thi kind of explor isn t cheap ballard note joke that we had 100 000 pound of equip and 10 van and six robot and a partridg in a pear tree you have to understand that the bismarck battl wa wage in a forc 8 sea 50 knot wind 15 foot wave with overcast and no celesti navig ballard sai the search for the bismarck which like the titan sank on it maiden voyag wa further complic by the natur of the atlant ocean the battleship wa in 16 000 feet of water and it wa in a mountain rang ballard sai not without enthusiasm it wa in an aw place and it wa in the northern latitud up at 48 degre north latitud which is not a nice stretch of ocean ever even in the summer despit the difficulti ballard wa drawn to the wreck becaus like the titan it is on of the most famou lost chunk of histori to litter the ocean floor i do it becaus of the challeng to do it he sai but i m also interest in the fact that thi ship is well preserv there is probabl more histori preserv in the deep ocean of the world than in all the museum of the world although it ha lost it gun turret and wa hit by numer shell and torpedo the bismarck still ha touch of fresh ballard add cite the huge paint swastika on the ship s bow and stern in it dai the 50 000 ton bismarck with heavi armor eight 15 inch gun capabl of fire on ton shell 24 mile and high perform diesel engin wa on of the most power warship afloat and briefli it prove to be just that slip out of it home port of danzig now gdynia on mai 18 1941 to attack alli convoi the bismarck soon had much of the british royal navi look for it at the time england face a victori germani alon and wa depend on convoi from america for most of it food and war materi discov by two british heavi cruiser on mai 23 the bismarck wa engag the next dai by two other british warship from a distanc of 25 000 yard the bismarck s huge shell hit the hood start a fire in an ammunit locker within minut the hood explod kill all but three of the ship s 1 400 crew member the princ of wale wa also damag of the bismarck the british were lucki to get it to the bottom ballard claim in the climact battl a freak hit by a torpedo launch from a vintag world war i biplan knock out the bismarck s steer forc the crippl battleship to wait for the british to come and get it of cours the british came and the bismarck wa sunk in the atlant about 600 mile west of franc sinc the discoveri of the bismarck ballard sai there ha been curios about what actual caus the ship to sink british firepow or scuttl by her own crew but ballard believ the evid make the point moot the british warship had order to sink the bismarck not captur it and the german were under order not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war prize he sai at 10 a m on mai 27 the captain of the bismarck order hi crew to open the seacock on hi disabl ship thu flood the hull ballard recount about 10 30 a m the bismarck wa hit by three torpedo from the british cruiser dorsetshir and sank three minut later bismarck s survivor so it wa on it wai down and the torpedo help but it wa on it wai down ballard sai if thei hadn t open the seacock i m convinc the british would have sat there and plunk torpedo into it until it sank so it s sort of academ who sank it onli about 100 of the bismarck s crew surviv nearli 2 300 perish includ sever hundr who were swim in the water after their ship disappear it is that moment that seem to galvan ballard when the bismarck sank approxim 800 live soul went into the water and were aliv after the ship went under he sai lean forward in hi chair and the dorsetshir came in and began pick up survivor and then someon thought thei saw a periscop and thei took off and thei left 700 peopl in the water aliv can you imagin the aw the hopeless the despair of the sailor who s just had a ship blown out from underneath him he s paddl and freez to death in thi water and salvat is right there and he s grab hold of the hull and the ship take off ballard ha said he will not reveal the exact locat of the bismarck except to german author as a ship of war the battleship belong to germani he sai although there might be some debat about which half of that divid countri would have the more legitim claim as with the titan ballard sai he strongli believ that such rel recent wreck should be left undisturb memori to those who perish as for wreck from the dim reach of the past ballard argu that thei should be explor onli by qualifi archeologist intent on broaden histor knowledg in fact he still becom visibl angri that privat expedit to the titan took some artifact from the wreck develop deep sea robot but ballard seem to be chiefli an enthusiast not a critic in particular he is a propon of machin especi robot ballard ha head up the develop of a system of deep sea unman robot call the argo jason system equip with camera and other sens devic the robot ar now capabl of plumb the world s deep water faster and more safe than the tini slow man submarin that previous were the cut edg of ocean research and explor he sai while an unman robot name jason jr wa us in a 1986 expedit to the titan it wa onli within the last few month that the leap wa made to fulli robot explor ballard sai mean that robot can now be direct from a surfac ship rather than from a man submarin via a control cabl it s a relief that he and other won t have to spend five or more hour per dai commut to the ocean floor which averag 12 000 feet in depth he sai even though he ha spent a lot of time in cramp research submarin and probabl will spend more ballard is mif by the ineffici of the romant littl gui refer to the small submarin he explain you re spend five hour a dai freez to death in thi littl sphere our averag dive time on the titan wa three hour a dai three hour out of 24 and you ve got 50 peopl and you ve got on gui look out of a window more interest in scienc ballard ha been talk about the potenti of thi technolog for year but recent advanc have made him more convinc than ever that the concept of telepres will revolution not onli undersea explor but the wai mani peopl travel more import he see the technolog as capabl of rekindl interest in scienc among american schoolchildren we re now reach a point in technolog in imag devic both acoust and visual fiber optic

where i don t feel profession inconvenienc by live in montana how much time he actual will spend in northern montana is an open question though given the demand of the explor televis seri with the

the sea 70 of the planet s under water we ve seen less than 1 of 1 i mean we know more about the mountain rang on mar than the mountain rang of our own planet he sai the vast unknown it is thi sens of
