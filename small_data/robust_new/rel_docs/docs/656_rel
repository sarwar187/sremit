level of 0 005 mg l the level which most bottl water do not exce the comment argu that the fact that 0 005 mg l is at the lower limit of reliabl measur for lead doe not justifi set a standard at that

promulg of drink water regul under the sdwa by amend the qualiti standard for bottl water to maintain compat with epa regul fda conclud that amend the standard for lead in bottl water to 0 005 mg l is fulli compat and consist with the epa standard base on the avail health effect inform epa establish an mclg of zero for lead in drink water by adopt thi mclg epa wa in effect sai that if zero lead in

that ar free of signific lead contamin and can readili produc bottl water product with lead level below 0 005 mg l the pql for lead in water consequ becaus thi level which is as close to epa mclg of

propos befor it publish in the feder regist epa state that the regulatori approach taken by fda to establish an allow level of 0 005 mg l for lead in bottl water is consist with the intent of the npdwr for lead in public drink water ref 4 2 on comment assert that there is no safe threshold for lead in drink water and becaus technolog resourc and knowledg make it feasibl to measur lead in water at the 0 002 mg l level fda should establish the allow level for lead in bottl water at that level the comment contend that becaus larg water compani have been test for lead and report lead level of 0 0 001 0 002 0 003 and 0 004 mg l to epa the pql is substanti lower than 0 005 mg l the comment state that anoth organ which ha limit resourc and is not in the busi of suppli water commerci us a

epa pql concept is inappropri epa pql is set at the lowest concentr for a contamin that laboratori certifi by the state or by epa for water analys can reliabl measur within specifi limit of precis and

that the true valu is greater than zero epa gener set the pql at 5 to 10 time the mdl depend on the degre of health risk pose by a contamin for contamin like lead that pose a high degre of health risk

should review thi standard in a few year becaus epa 1991 rule for lead in drink water ha led to increas analysi for lead in water and us the best avail methodolog mani laboratori can now routin measur

set the allow level in bottl water at the limit of detect i e 0 005 mg l or no detect lead whichev is less fda disagre that establish the allow level for lead in bottl water at the limit of detect i e 0 005 mg l or no detect lead whichev is less is appropri as discuss abov 0 005 mg l the pql for lead in water repres the lowest concentr that state or epa certifi laboratori for water analys can

statement in the propos that if the propos becom a final rule bottler will be requir to test each lot of bottl water to ensur that it contain less than 0 005 mg l of lead the comment argu that becaus most bottler ar routin meet the 0 005 mg l standard for lead a requir for test each lot of bottl water for lead is not necessari furthermor the major of the comment argu that test each lot of bottl water for lead would impos a signific financi burden on the bottl water industri for exampl comment from two trade associ repres bottl water manufactur maintain that a requir for test each lot of bottl water for lead would impos addit annual cost that thei estim at 15 000 for a small bottler and 300 000 for a larg bottler under the current good manufactur practic cgmp regul for the process and

ani requir for monitor timefram or submiss of result to ensur that bottler meet the qualiti standard moreov the comment object to allow distribut of a bottl water product that is below the water qualiti standard argu that given the emphasi on the qualiti of bottl water vers tap water by the bottl water industri bottler ar not like to print a substandard statement on the label fda agre that bottler ar not like to market bottl water that would be requir to bear a statement of substandard qualiti with respect to lead howev fda note that the us of such a statement on the label of a food

that more need to be learn about the risk from renov and remodel activ befor subject such activ to regul follow the complet by april 1995 of a studi of the risk creat by renov and remodel activ congress ha requir epa to revis the section 402 a regul to appli them to those renov and remodel activ which creat lead hazard in section 402 c congress told epa what factor to consid i n determin which contractor ar engag in such activ and requir that if epa determin that ani categori of contractor doe not requir certif epa shall publish an explan again becaus of the fact that the statut specif mention contractor and not homeown it is epa interpret of section 402 c 3 that congress focu wa on the need to regul contractor do renov and remodel activ and not homeown do renov and remodel of their own home epa assum that in write section 402 c congress did not direct that homeown ultim be regul under section 402 a becaus congress never intend homeown do abat in their own home to be cover by section 402 a in the first place inde homeown work in their own home ar more like to be engag in the sort of activ describ in the definit of interim control which activ requir neither train nor certif while epa recogn that the univers of potenti regul entiti is broader than just contractor and homeown do their own abat epa ha decid to exclud onli the latter categori of individu from the scope of these regul epa ha chosen to draft thi exclus narrowli becaus it recogn the potenti health and environment hazard that could result from improperli perform abat and want to minim such hazard howev epa invit comment on the scope of thi exclus as draft and specif on whether other categori of individu or group e g renter abat their own apart or volunt organ that do renov work should also be exclud epa is howev concern about the potenti exposur to lead which an untrain and uncertifi homeown mai caus to himself herself and other famili member as a result of work done as a result of thi concern epa strongli encourag state to consid whether thei wish to us their own legal author to regul work done by the homeown for exampl state mai wish to consid the inclus of standard for lead base paint activ in appropri build code thi approach could mirror other state and local regulatori program alreadi us to control other work done in home such as electr and plumb work in addit to encourag state to consid program with the author to regul homeown epa plan an aggress awar campaign direct at homeown thi program will includ not onli the design and distribut of inform materi but the agenc

hanger garag and wholesal distribut facil under tsca section 402 b the onli exampl of a superstructur list is a bridg but draw on the common mean of superstructur epa is propos to includ other structur such as watertow aboveground storag tank oil refineri util and other structur the agenc s determin to group target hous and public build togeth is base on two factor on factor is that the potenti for lead exposur in a public build set such as a museum school or daycar center is similar to the potenti for lead exposur to children in target hous where famili and children resid consequ epa is propos standard for lead base paint activ in public build that have the same degre of protect as those for target hous the second factor in epa decis to propos separ categori is due to differ in the structur design and build materi that ar commonli us in target hous public build and those us in commerci build superstructur for exampl the structur design and build materi e g wallboard ceil tile floor materi wooden doorwai and window frame found in public build ar often similar to those found in target hous commerci build and superstructur on the other hand typic ar construct of metal such as structur steel work practic for the conduct of lead base paint activ also differ for the aforement categori the build materi in commerci build and superstructur requir work practic for delead activ that ar veri differ than activ associ with lead abat in target hous or public build for exampl the delead of a watertow or industri warehous call for sophist rig and scaffold equip and the erect of contain structur these method ar not applic to the abat of lead base paint in target hous or public build given these differ as well as inform suppli by the profession commun on delead steel structur and commerci build the agenc believ there is littl crossov between worker practic in the target hous public build realm and those in the commerci build steel structur realm rather evid suggest that individu ar either work in the abat of target hous and public build or in the delead of commerci build and steel structur in draft thi propos the agenc consid inform provid by sever profession group whose member perform work in commerci build and superstructur base on thi inform it appear that a broader rang of task ar practic by fewer categori of individu work these structur consequ onli two accredit disciplin supervisor and worker have been establish for individu work in commerci build and superstructur therefor thi propos would establish the follow certif disciplin inspector technician inspector risk assessor supervisor planner project design and worker for target hous and public build and supervisor and worker for commerci build and superstructur epa is also propos standard for lead base paint activ in three separ categori of facil these categori includ target hous public build and commerci build and superstructur in target hous the standard cover inspect risk assess and lead abat the second set of standard for public build cover the identif of lead base paint and lead contain materi risk assess abat and demolit the final set of standard ar for identif delead and demolit in commerci build and superstructur the agenc is request comment on it propos definit of public build and it propos to regul them in a fashion similar to target hous specif the agenc is interest in comment on whether the univers of build type cover under the propos definit of public build compris the appropri rang of build type further the agenc is interest in comment on an altern strategi that would decreas the number of public build type that should be regul in a fashion similar to target hous d section 403 as part of the lead base paint exposur reduct act section 402 and 404 repres just two of the mani mandat that epa is work under to address the issu of lead exposur section 403 of tsca is on of these other mandat that section requir that the agenc shall promulg

it propos regul under section 403 while the 403 rule when promulg will be import for the lead exposur reduct program it must be emphas that it is essenti a sourc of guidanc for the decisionmak thi is in contrast to todai s propos rule under section 402 and 404 which is an infrastructur and how to type of rule when promulg todai s propos will develop an infrastructur of train certif and standard

agenc s opinion significantli impair the public s abil to meaningfulli comment on todai s propos thi is becaus the identif at a later date in the section 403 rule level of lead that would result in advers human health effect is not expect to have a signific impact on the develop of the standard and requir of thi propos regul for exampl the procedur establish in propos 745 228 b 4 of the regulatori text for the conduct of dust sampl as a part of a risk assess in target hous ar not expect to chang as a function of the level establish for lead contamin dust under the section 403 rule similarli the number of cours hour need to properli train a risk assessor would probabl not chang due to the establish of a particular definit of lead base paint hazard under the section 403 regul in summari the agenc believ that the standard and requir propos in the 402 and 404 rule can be evalu independ of the definit to be propos in the futur under section 403 recent the agenc publish guidanc on residenti lead base paint lead contamin dust and lead contamin soil thi guidanc is intend to be us to priorit primari prevent activ that address hazard from lead in and around resid epa expect that

requir mandat that individu conduct inspect also be requir to be train to conduct risk assess as defin by the statut were overli burdensom other comment suggest util individu with less skill educ and train to simpli collect the data need by a risk assessor to evalu lead hazard thu in larg set the work could be done at a significantli lower cost while not compromis the qualiti of either the inspect

the inspector technician who would onli conduct inspect and anoth more advanc posit the inspector risk assessor who would conduct risk assess but who also could conduct inspect also will enabl individu to logic progress in their profess to foster thi progress the agenc is propos to structur the inspector technician cours so that it mai be taken as a distinct cours separ from the inspector risk assessor cours upon passag of the inspector technician cours an individu would be abl to secur certif as an inspector technician onc certifi as an inspector technician an individu would be abl to gain the work experi necessari to take the inspector risk assessor cours and to becom certifi as an inspector risk assessor on the other hand individu that alreadi possess the experi and or educ requir to becom certifi as an inspector risk assessor would take the inspector technician train cours and the inspector risk assessor train cours togeth as on unit upon complet of the unit individu would becom elig for certif as an inspector risk assessor by structur the two cours in thi wai the agenc also ha avoid unnecessari duplic in train cours which individu seek to advanc their career sometim encount when take addit train for other certif the content of the propos inspector risk assessor cours supplement the inspector technician cours and would not repeat ani of the materi from the inspector technician cours anoth exampl of thi approach can be seen in the supervisor and planner project design train cours an individu could becom certifi as a supervisor for target hous and public build or as a planner project design for target hous and public build howev to becom certifi as a planner project design an individu would take the supervisor cours and the planner project design cours as on unit individu seek certif as a supervisor would onli take the supervisor cours but could take the segment on plan project design at a later date if thei chose to pursu certif as a planner project design onc again the planner project design cours would supplement the supervisor cours and would not repeat ani of the materi from the supervisor cours the agenc receiv comment from a number of interest parti in refer to the need to avoid duplic train in respons the agenc consid take a modular approach by specifi a core curriculum that would be common to all the categori of individu conduct lead base paint activ howev epa review of the train requir indic that the onli knowledg and skill element common to all the categori ar background inform on lead health effect and regulatori

the base case analysi also compar total measur benefit and increment cost on a per residenti abat basi to gain addit insight to the impact of the propos regul in an effort to minim the impact of the

estim total measur benefit sai 15 to 20 percent ar attribut to the propos rule it is possibl for the increment benefit to equal or exce the increment cost for paint abat activ in the residenti hous sector a similar comparison is not possibl for the nonresidenti sector becaus data limit preclud benefit estim for thi sector thi is not to impli that the benefit result from nonresidenti abat ar insignific all the benefit categori believ to result from public and commerci and steel structur delead ar identifi in tabl 3 avail inform regard the scope of activ and present in the uncertainti section below would suggest that substanti benefit ar like to exist in the form of other worker benefit benefit to nearbi resid and ecolog benefit the estim of the benefit would increas if all the

twice as like to have young children and newborn as the hous stock in gener thi second assumpt captur the increas concern about lead hazard and children and the increas benefit that would accru to household with young children the increas concern will like result in increas abat rate among hous unit with children howev there ar no data current avail on which to base an estim of thi increas likelihood of abat and the estim us mai be low a low estim will result in an underestim of the averag residenti unit benefit likewis a high estim will result in an overestim of the averag residenti

inform avail data limit have also prevent an assess of how the quantiti of lead base paint activ mai chang with altern regulatori option therefor epa ha been unabl to estim the effect of more or less precript approach rel to the propos on the quantiti of lead base paint activ the agenc solicit comment and suggest about data sourc or method that mai help in assess the increment benefit and cost of altern approach in order to deal with thi issu it is assum that the demand for delead in massachusett can provid a proxi for estim nation demand after the regul is in place thi is deem appropri sinc the train accredit and perform requir thu cost for the establish massachusett program ar similar to that of the propos rule to the extent that residenti abat ar mandatori in massachusett when elev blood lead ebl children ar identifi the adopt of massachusett abat rate will result in an overestim of the number of nation residenti abat howev it is felt that overestim will be minim for the follow two reason inform from the massachusett depart of health indic that onli 10 to 20 percent of the residenti abat ar a result of the presenc of ebl children and becaus it is like that other state will also adopt a mandatori abat provis for ebl children epa know of no other state program that mai provid addit insight to the expect impact on demand result from the implement of the propos rule and therefor solicit public comment on the exist of state program and relev inform german to thi issu 6 sensit analysi six set of sensit analys were conduct two set affect onli the cost ar altern cost of standard result from altern estim of unit cost or altern assumpt of the number of event and altern train cost result from altern definit of train requir there ar two set of sensit analys that affect the benefit while leav the cost unchang these two analys explor altern level of benefit to adult resid of unit abat and altern valu of a statist life and final there ar two set of analys that affect both the cost and the benefit these us an altern discount rate and assum altern level of abat activ the impact of these variabl on the estim cost and benefit ar present in tabl 5 and 6 respect the greatest affect on the estim benefit and cost ar associ with the assumpt concern choic of discount rate and the rate at which soil abat will occur sinc the benefit result from the propos regul will not occur simultan with the cost it is necessari to compar stream of cost with the result stream of benefit thi is done by discount futur cost and benefit and sum the discount valu two altern approach were investig us 7 percent in place of 3 percent to reflect an altern social rate of time prefer and us a two stage procedur that allow for the us of two differ discount rate margin rate of return on capit 7 percent for annual the capit cost and a social rate of time prefer 3 percent for discount the stream of annual cost and benefit the distinct between these two approach rest with whether the sourc of fund for lead base paint activ ar displac invest or consumpt simpli discount the stream of cost by 7 percent decreas the total 50 year cost estim by 27 percent at the same time increas the discount rate to 7 percent substanti decreas the estim benefit more than the cost becaus mani of the benefit will occur further in the futur there ar potenti two separ effect of chang the discount rate first the benefit per abat decreas for all the quantifi benefit categori except for worker benefit and the present valu of the 50 year benefit decreas for all the benefit categori includ worker the combin of these two effect decreas the present valu of the 50 year benefit stream by 87 percent consequ the choic of discount rate affect benefit to a much greater extent than it doe cost the result of the two stage discount procedur ar veri sensit to the amort period the length of time capit is divert from invest given the uncertainti about the appropri amort period 50 year discount cost were not calcul howev as demonstr in the literatur the two stage result will fall between the singl discount rate of 3 and 7 percent us in these analys on of the most import element us in estim the benefit is the willing to pai to avoid a unit reduct in the risk of death also refer to as the valu of a statist life the valu of a statist life directli enter the calcul of the benefit of the avoid neonat mortal adult resid hypertens relat benefit when includ and worker benefit the result present in base case ar calcul us a valu of 5 3 million per statist life the standard deviat of these valu is 3 8 million a us rang of altern valu for sensit analysi is mean valu minu on standard deviat and the mean valu plu on standard deviat the rang of altern valu of a statist life is therefor 1 8 million to 9 1 million us of thi rang will have a signific effect on neonat mortal benefit howev the altern valu do not alter the overal benefit estim greatli the present valu of benefit per abat and of total benefit over 50 year discount at 3 percent chang by plu or minu 5 percent the primari analysi reli on massachusett and osha data to estim most of the level of abat activ in term of the number of inspect and abat delead under the propos regul the massachusett and osha data provid littl inform regard the number of soil abat for estim of rate of soil abat therefor the analysi reli on inform on rate of radon abat the primari analysi assum a similar respons rate to the presenc of lead in soil as to the presenc of radon in soil in other word 20 percent of the soil inspect that determin the presenc of lead result in a soil abat the sensit analysi assum two altern abat rate 84 and 10 percent which reflect like respons rate extrem for target hous the lead paint abat rate wa 84 percent if individu respond to the presenc of lead in the soil similarli to interior lead paint then the soil abat rate also will be 84 percent the 10 percent altern is examin becaus base on the radon abat experi the 20 percent abat rate us in the primari analysi mai be too high chang the level of soil abat activ will affect train standard and state cost at an 84 percent abat rate the total cost of the regul will increas by 26 percent with standard cost increas 32 percent us a 10 percent abat rate the total cost will decreas by onli 4 5 percent chang the level of soil abat activ also chang the estim benefit the per abat benefit do not chang from perform an interior onli soil onli or combin paint and soil abat howev the averag per abat benefit chang when the number of soil and paint and soil combin abat chang at an 84 percent abat rate the total measur benefit will increas 30 percent and us a 10 percent abat rate will result in a 5 percent decreas in total measur benefit 7 impact of the

impact on small entiti epa conduct such an analysi includ it as part of the ria base on thi analysi of avail data epa preliminarili conclud that the propos rule should not place undu burden on small busi the analysi is summar below 2 impact on small busi epa assess potenti impact both absolut and rel burden on small abat firm in the construct industri to examin the potenti impact of the propos rule on small abat establish complianc cost as a percentag of oper cost were estim for both small and larg firm and then compar to determin if small firm ar more advers impact than larg firm the complianc cost consist of two compon 1 licens and train cost for worker and supervisor as well as licens cost for firm and 2 increment cost of perform standard for abat procedur these two compon coincid with the two decis point face by firm interest in perform lead base paint abat work includ soil abat in order to be a player in thi industri a firm must be licens and it employe must be train and certifi it is like that a firm will incur these expens in anticip of work base on it assess of the futur demand for such servic it competit and the price it will be abl to charg therefor the firm mai incur the cost with no opportun to recoup them thu decreas it profit the second set of cost those result from perform standard ar of a differ natur the firm that do lead abat work also perform similar work in set that do not involv lead and ar not affect by the propos rule these cost occur at the second decis point thei will be incur by a firm onli if it choos to undertak a given lead base paint job in each case the firm can determin the impact of the perform standard on it sale and profit level if the impact will be undesir e g decreas profit level the firm can declin the work in thi voluntari set the perform standard will not have an impact on the profit of small busi likewis owner of properti will incur the perform standard cost onli if abat ar in their benefit a comparison of increment train and licens cost to the estim oper cost for an averag small firm for each sic group involv with lead abat is shown in tabl 7 below these sic group cover abat in residenti public commerci and industri build as well as steel structur abat and delead assum that none of the train and licens cost ar shift forward in the form of higher price the ratio of complianc cost to oper cost for small establish rang between 1 2 and 3 2 percent cost ratio ar similarli estim for larg establish in tabl 8 below for larg firm the ratio tend to be slightli lower rang from1 0 to 2 3 percent for both larg and small establish the largest cost ratio occur for sic 1721 paint contractor howev for these firm a larg non lead paint market is avail in all case complianc cost equal a small percentag of oper cost while thi shift of cost will allevi the burden on abat and delead firm the increment cost of the regul mai affect residenti and commerci build owner consist with the argument present abov under thi propos rule abat is a voluntari action as such a landlord is unlik to undertak an abat unless he or she is abl to pass the cost on to hi or her tenant or otherwis recoup the cost in term of higher properti valu epa is concern about the possibl that landlord of margin profit properti under the threat of civil suit mai chose the altern of abandon the properti rather than incur the cost of abat epa solicit comment provid data or method ani such effect on the remov target hous from the market an altern indic which demonstr potenti impact on small abat firm focus on profit epa subtract estim establish complianc cost from averag profit per establish to determin post complianc profit thi calcul wa also perform separ for small and larg establish for the same sic code identifi abov assum scenario 1 see tabl 9 and 10 below the estim averag adjust profit for small establish in two of the nine affect industri sector becom neg on of these sector miscellan trade contractor wa assum as the most like to perform a high frequenc of veri costli soil abat project thu complianc cost exceed profit by more than a factor of 10 for 3 other sector complianc cost repres more than 50 percent of abat establish profit for larg firm the result of thi calcul indic the typic larg firm to remain profit in all sector thu base on the profit indic size of delead firm enter the abat industri mai be impact by thi propos rule these calcul on profit assum all cost were absorb by affect firm thi is more reason in the short run than in the long run epa doe not have the necessari inform to ascertain the cost pass through rate and result impact on individu firm in the short run also the analysi wa constrain to us sic data that ar from a set of firm that mai be differ from firm compli with thi propos rule and therefor the financi inform mai not be repres of potenti abat firm epa solicit comment on avail data to estim these impact the two indic present abov were select to present the like bound of the impact associ with the propos rule the actual impact will like lie somewher between these extrem the comparison of impact on small and larg train provid wa not perform for two reason except for the rltc most train provid ar small so there would be no differenti effect base on size of the firm in addit it is like that the train provid will pass the addit cost on to their traine sinc the chang will be requir by feder regul thei will appli to all train provid second there will be heighten concern about lead base paint hazard and thu a greater willing to pai for train personnel
