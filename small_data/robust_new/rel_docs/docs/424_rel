to sai how thing would be if the social democrat sdp wish becam realiti if red green coalit took over power and respons in germani thi is what we have to make clear to the voter applaus the voter ha to know what the issu ar where the differ lie and despit all those who give us advic on how we should move toward elector victori like a slalom racer the voter doe not want the differ to be blur i am inde in favor of a fair elector campaign but fair doe not mean that someon lash out at us and we with christian convict turn the other cheek we have no intent of do that church assembl applaus our countri is set it futur cours and everyon sens thi we must make clear what we stand for for a polici for peac and freedom thi mean that we should tell peopl that thi is not a gift grant from heaven but that the correct of bismarck s word that the fate of a nation is decid in it foreign and secur polici ha becom notic again in recent dai week and month a polici of peac and freedom for germani alwai mean friendship and partnership with our neighbor sinc konrad adenau it ha been our import goal to be reliabl friend and partner and our success in the world ha been base on thi applaus thi mean a polici to stop and reduc unemploy we cannot and must not accept an unemploy figur of 4 million thi is the great domest challeng face our countri but thi also mean a polici for invest a polici for growth and i want to sai thi too thi mean that everyon must take part in thi it is not as easi as all that just sai when thing were good it wa the compani and union and when thing were bad it wa down to the politician we all have a joint respons here applaus growth and job with a secur futur alwai mean that we ar capabl of reform and of a rethink mani ar surpris that we ar face a rather unusu situat in thi elect campaign those who on the elect dai will have had the respons for 12 year talk about further develop safeguard the futur and the need for a rethink while those who want to take power talk about econom asset i like thi divis becaus it forc us and make it necessari for us to tell peopl what is go on to sai thing that mai appear uncomfort and to carri through what is requir our countri will have no futur if we do not now take stock and see our futur prospect and if we ar not capabl of ask quit soberli what ha gone well in thi decad and mani thing have gone veri well and what ha prove not worthwhil the sdp is take a veri easi path as thei have done time and again in recent decad with their plan thei would lead the countri if thei had the respons of govern into intern isol willi brandt said it the german sdp against the rest of the world and if you take a look now at the posit of the german sdp within the socialist intern in europ you will notic that thei ar complet isol friend the word isol must never again becom a motto for german polici applaus we have paid a bitter price in thi centuri for the occas when our countri isol itself or when as often happen it allow itself to be driven into isol we must remain capabl of plai a full part in the allianc and thi is essenti if we ar to enjoi trust there ha just been a lot of talk and rightli so about the unif confer of the union here in hamburg on 1 octob 1990 we would never have seen the dai of german uniti if our friend in the west and our partner in the east had not trust us and trust is the prerequisit for everyth both in privat life and in polit applaus thi 1994 elect year is a difficult year not onli here in germani but everywher in all industri countri thi observ is correct but it doe not help us here at all we ar live through dramat chang in the world in europ and in germani it is virtual imposs now for the ordinari citizen to grasp the mean of the daili rapid success of imag reflect new dramat event mani feel that it is all too much for them thi give rise to a sens of uncertainti and to anxieti and lead peopl to expect far too much of politician thi then lead to that famou word disillusion verdrossenheit which we have alreadi heard thi morn peopl then talk about disillusion with polit politikverdrossenheit but i mai add that all i can see is a gener disillusion when i compar the christian democrat union s cdu declin membership figur with those of the trade union proportion speak i don t get the impress that on of us is ani better off than the other the dignifi gentlemen in the employ organ don t talk about the number leav them but those figur ar sizabl too we also know about the figur for the church and for sport club we ar wit a develop which extend far beyond everydai polit peopl ar becom increasingli reluct to make commit and thi is natur be reflect in polit as well but precis becaus thi is the case we cannot give in immedi to everi pass trend no we must stand up for our program we must present it in a languag that peopl can understand and we must act resolut against those fals prophet who seek to exploit anxieti and feel of uncertainti for their own polit end ladi and gentlemen rare befor have such persist effort been made to us belli ach and the cover of pessim to mount polit campaign a wit who is realli worth quot here is martin waltzer who recent said the follow in hi honorari doctorship speech in dresden on the topic uniti is not fail i quot there ar evid peopl who ar princip in a bad mood who cannot stand their own person disillusion thu we ar all suppos to share thi disillusion then he continu that a parti that also us histor difficulti for parti polit polem show it is unabl to make ani suggest to resolv the difficulti i have noth to add to that applaus thi mean that we that i will fight for everi vote that we will repres our belief on the offens and ladi and gentlemen on the offens mean be prepar for the fight offens doe not mean invit peopl to background talk and tell them thing if possibl without state who is sai it which on is otherwis too scare to tell the peopl that is no great achiev offens for me doe not mean be afraid of on s own courag give in to those who believ thei ar power becaus thei perhap have had access to the opportun provid by print materi or televis screen we stand for our polici we will win without give in to anyon friend that is the decis thing applaus that doe not mean the end of discuss not by ani mean a larg parti such as our a larg polit commun such as our ha of cours to struggl to find the correct futur path we must do thi with respect for the view of other we have to be capabl of listen to argument and weigh them up but ladi and gentlemen we must not complet forget to think about the calend when there is an elect in a feder state parliament in three week time everyon in the cdu in germani is oblig to think of the elector campaign that will take place in the even in that state in the snow and ic and to put their head on the block for thi parti applaus and there cannot be for anyon and i sai anyon becaus i mean anyon there cannot be for anyon a place in the box at the state theater of the republ where on watch with slight amus the perform of some jester like creatur on the stage those who now creat an imag for themselv at the expens of the whole exclud themselv from the commun applaus therefor dear friend let s not now discuss how we will do in the elect in case we finish badli we mai have a grand coalit and hide under the wing of the sdp it s smelli but it s warm that cannot be our polici dear friend applaus we want to continu the coalit cdu csu christian social union and fdp free democrat parti and certainli not becaus of love feel it is a question of reason how can we decid question about germani s futur that we ar now face with such overwhelm pressur i think and not just me that despit all the thing that sometim annoi us in a dai that thi is best possibl with the fdp therefor let us stop help the sdp in their elect campaign by address them from the outset as our futur partner when i sai thi so that there is no doubt about thi i still maintain the statement that the christian democrat union of germani is natur abl to form a coalit with ani democrat parti we have such coalit in the feder state and i support them howev for the feder govern thi doe not augur well but we want thing to be good in our countri and that is the decis thing applaus therefor dear friend to state it briefli thi is our polici those who want a differ polici have a chanc between now and late wednesdai afternoon 23 februari to argu their case in thi room but when we go home on wednesdai these debat ar finish then we will fight togeth and those who don t want that will be isol that is clear applaus it is also true dear friend that polit in the nineti everi decad ha it characterist that polit in the nineti ha becom more difficult also becaus our countri and our peopl ar subject to more chang than in previou period thi is reflect not onli in opinion poll it is reflect everywher i will give an exampl of how fast move we ar and i sai thi to myself too you see in bad kleinen in june 1993 offic of the gsg 9 special task forc and of the feder crimin investig offic apprehend terrorist on gsg 9 offic wa murder in the oper the killer who wa a terrorist also di it ha now been shown to have been a suicid in the dai that follow blame wa pin not on the perpetr but on the offic who had given hi life for our countri and our freedom now ladi and gentlemen if we allow and thi is a matter for us as we sit here not just the concern of the chancellor and the parti chairman but our common concern if we allow a mood to be gener in germani that compel the murder man to prove that he is not a murder if we have a develop where on can be prosecut and forc to answer publicli for describ such a perpetr as a murder and if we no longer even talk about the victim that is intoler for the atmospher in thi countri applaus i am glad to take the exampl of thi gsg 9 offic as an opportun to express gratitud to all those who spend dai and night guard our secur and who receiv far too littl sympathi and support applaus we should not let ourselv be upset by what is be said everi dai mani peopl ar look at me now as if i were a rather strang creatur as if to sai how can he possibl still talk about win the elect ladi and gentlemen i am go by my experi and my experi is that i have been constantli sustain by wave of support dure these past decad as you know you know i rememb exactli what it wa like in decemb 1982 and januari 1983 when mani even in our own parti said we would have hardli ani time in power and that we would fritter everyth awai by call earli elect my argument that we could not go ahead with the deploy of the persh on the strength of a borrow elect result count for littl at least at first our sdp colleagu and friend who had move out and were sit with their suitcas in the parliament build were sai it wa just an accid and thei would soon be back it ha been 12 year now thei have unpack their case and i am in favor of them keep those case in the attic for a littl while longer applaus ladi and gentlemen where would we be todai what would have happen to german uniti and what would be happen right now to nato in former yugoslavia if we had follow the sdp then i don t need to look back that far think of lothar de maizier rememb februari 1990 sure we ar still allow to do that i read and mani of those who wrote it so wise ar watch me now and that is why i extend a particularli warm welcom to them ladi and gentlemen at that time i read the follow those area in saxoni saxoni anhalt thuringia and so on ar ancient social democrat stronghold and how can you possibl hope to campaign there our chanc were rate as zero there were mani factor i admit but we won the elect ladi and gentlemen we won the elect to the first volkskamm peopl s chamber with lothar de maizier and our friend that is the realiti applaus therefor and i will put it quit simpli whichev wai the wind blow whether we can chang it cours depend crucial on us and if we do not just talk about a close relationship with peopl but we practic it and if we take part in debat and if we present our program and our repres in a credibl manner then we have a veri good chanc therefor let s get on with thing togeth here in hamburg we have to sai first and foremost why we want to take on the respons of govern in bonn again why we ar put ourselv forward and what our argument ar i think that the first and most import factor is that in domest polici we ar capabl despit 4 million unemploi and the problem associ with thi of safeguard germani as a locat for invest and busi that we know that without perform there will be no growth no job for the futur and no social secur and that friend whether we like it or not there ha to be a rethink becaus the chang in the world have been so dramat as an industri nation we now have so much new competit that it is also necessari to call into question econom asset we want to be elect becaus our social polici safeguard peopl s home and orient we want to be elect becaus we stand for a strong liber state base on the rule of law not for a laissez fair state but for a state which provid protect and secur for it citizen and we want to be elect becaus we stand up for understand between the gener between young and old for strengthen famili with children for recogn respect and show affect for the elderli on whose shoulder we ar stand we want to be elect becaus our foreign and secur polici guarante peac and freedom and becaus we ar reliabl partner thi also includ and i am refer here especi and expressli to all my predecessor in the post of parti chairman such as rainer barzel as well as in the post of chancellor insofar as thei were from the cdu csu parti the fact that we ar and remain the parti of europ german uniti and european unif ar two side of the same coin applaus we also want to be elect becaus for us freedom solidar and justic must be the guid principl of our polici and becaus the debat at thi parti confer on the kei program make thi even clearer ladi and gentlemen we also want to be elect becaus we do not begin to swai in the wind when it is necessari to distanc ourselv clearli and without hesit from extremist on the right and left for us right wing extremist ar live in the past and have not learn from histori and left wing extremist ar respons for the materi and spiritu devast in on part of germani in other word extremist on the left and right ar a disgrac to our countri applaus friend we also want to be elect becaus we can point to our success sai thi also mean of cours that noth more will be paid for thi afterward but when you look at the document you have about our success and achiev over the last 10 year and in particular in recent year you will see that mani outstand thing have been achiev over a brief period and we should keep remind peopl of thi it wa nevertheless possibl and we did it from 1983 up until shortli befor german reunif we reduc the state quota drastic the averag incom of an employe rose by almost 18 percent in real term and we prove that we could find job by creat 3 million new job i am sai thi becaus the sdp with their miser polici want to cover up the fact that the stabil of the former west germani up until 1989 had creat the prerequisit requir to overcom the econom challeng of the follow year of german unif applaus friend leav monei asid for a moment we can look around thi room todai and see peopl from brandenburg from east berlin from saxoni from saxoni anhalt and from thuringia and mecklenburg western pomerania and we can sai we ar happi in the old german fatherland that is the first thing and the most import thing applaus and it realli is a dream come true when i spoke to bori yeltsin recent about the form thi dai at the end of august would take 50 year later when the last russian soldier withdraw then i ask myself and i ask all of you would we have ever believ it possibl that thi would happen in total friendship in partnership in close cooper 50 year on that is a fantast thing thi is a reason to be pleas and not a reason to hide awai thi joi we mai feel applaus and friend if we stop for a moment and ask ourselv and we can all answer thi when in recent german histori ha there been a period in which the govern of our countri ha had such excel friendli relat with washington with moscow with pari and with london that is our polici so make sure you tell the peopl out there so that it is not gambl awai by the sdp who would lead the countri into isol applaus and sai thank you should not becom outmod in our countri either in privat or polit life for thi reason it wa a great joi for me to be abl recent to express onc again our countri s thank to georg bush and hi colleagu in washington as i do with mikhail gorbachev at everi possibl opportun we don t want to forget what these two men and other did for us applaus but friend thi gratitud should also includ in the state of former west germani in particular the thank to our 17 million fellow countrymen in the former gdr who were the on who made thi great achiev possibl in the first place with their call for germani unit fatherland applaus we ar not delv around in old file when we simpli sai that at thi great hour for our peopl the sdp stood on the sidelin that thei were wrong and i sai thi abov all becaus it is someth that i am remind of everi dai i get letter almost everi dai from mayor lord mayor state councillor state politician not least from my own home state who urg me to do everyth to ensur that the american stai here at all cost and thei ar the same peopl ladi and gentlemen who for year voic anti american sentiment at their council meet ami go home thei us to sai applaus it is not delv around in old file or mudsling and i won t even touch these stasi file if i start from the experi of these year such as the decis by the spd bundestag group thi is not some stasi secret it s an offici resolut from 1984 on the issu of the offic in salzgitt to stop the fund what wa thi all about it ha to be said becaus peopl have forgotten it all in such a short time after the experi with the wall and barb wire after the build of the wall it wa about set up an offic in west germani to document the act of inhuman of crime against human in germani afteral dure these year over 40 000 incid of maltreat tortur and so on were regist in order to be abl to name those respons at a later date it wa on of honeck s most import demand which he also made to me to remov thi thorn in the flesh of the henchmen of the then gdr and ladi and gentlemen and if we now recal how intoler it is for thi to be trivial todai we recal ladi and gentlemen that on could hardli demonstr then for human and human right in chile or in south africa while at the same time forget on s own compatriot we sai no more and no less than thi we will continu to exercis our right to do so dure the elect campaign not least among the 17 million of our fellow citizen in the former gdr which is now the new feder state when carp critic is made of the transitori problem which he have to solv togeth applaus nor ladi and gentlemen do we forget that lead german sdp were readi to accept honeck s other aw demand for our compatriot with dual nation to be expatri and sinc i wa the on who negoti with the hungarian govern dure the summer of 1989 i know what would have happen if we had kowtow to honeck when ten of thousand of our compatriot from the gdr and hungari cross the austrian border into freedom thi is the experi of histori and it s not a matter of close the file as mr thiers sai and then set up a histor commiss i don t have anyth against histor commiss but thei would reach exactli the same conclus that at a decis phase in german histori lead german sdp betrai a piec of our countri s futur that is the truth applaus friend we now have the equal import and difficult task of rethink germani s posit as a busi locat with a view to the econom and social develop of our countri that mean first of all not give in to the illus that it is now suffici to creat improv in our econom posit without simultan remov the deep seat fault that ar the underli caus of the econom slump thi wa not to quot a normal econom slump it is not a normal econom trough deep structur fault that have grown over the year have becom visibl it is also true and i don t have to be a guru to know thi that there ar clear sign of an improv in the econom situat onli we ar not under ani illus it will take a lot longer befor we experi posit effect on the labor market and the labor market doe not mean a statist of 4 million to me instead we should move awai from statist and look at the face of the peopl those who want to work not those who shirk work and abus the social benefit system but the mani million who want to work those peopl when thei ar not abl to work and particularli those who have been unemploi for a longer period ask themselv ever more frequent am i of ani us whatsoev that is the question we ar ask ourselv and a christian democrat union which is commit to social justic we ar not support of the market economi we ar support of the social market economi ladi and gentlemen a christian democrat union of thi kind applaus ha to concern itself with thi ha to think of everyth that can be done and find a remedi as soon as possibl there is no point in blame on anoth it is of cours true that two signatur ar requir on wage agreement that of the employ and that of the employe it is of cours true that a dramat overregul ha come about in mani area of our countri over the decad you can now see the effect of these terribl rule and regul in the reconstruct process in the state of former east germani if ludwig erhard had had thi overregul in 1953 the upturn would not have been success until decad later we realli must find the courag to sai we want a state base on the rule of law rather than on the mean of law enforc and we have to take the appropri step and do a great deal of dismantl if we let it rest for five year i believ that if the feder republ s construct law which we me includ were proud of at the begin of the eighti if we were to put them on ic for five year then we would build more and build better that s my belief applaus for thi reason i am plead passion for us give it a try we will make new mistak but do noth would be the biggest mistak of all and we have just seen two exampl of thi the railroad reform is an opu in itself here sit matthia wissman our fortun minist of transport and he deserv credit for hi success but han christoph seebohm start it all at the end of the 1950 s think we need decad to meet on of the crucial need to lighten the burden on our road and not to have all our good be transport along the road and autobahn name to build fast train and get them run for an industri countri which want to be among the best in the world thi is a luxuri which we can no longer afford applaus or take the postal servic which ha mani ten of thousand of the most modern job other countri depend on us our late friend jozsef antal at on of the last cabinet meet befor hi death decid that germani would be commiss with modern the hungarian postal servic and he did so with the classic justif name that the german would shortli have the world s most modern postal system he believ it so why don t we my friend laughter why don t we believ it and why don t we bring it about despit all the difficulti we have i believ if we tackl the subject thi wai and make secur germani s econom futur our main theme that we will justifi be abl to point to tremend result i would wish for exampl that the presid of all our chamber of trade and commerc when thei make clear what thei want polici to achiev which is well and good would begin by sai that the reduct of corpor tax in germani ha led to the lowest ever level in thi sector and that it provid an excel boost to growth and employ i would wish second that employ and union and i have to sai in all honesti we the state the public sector the chancellor must all begin to implement flexibl work hour and not just talk about them applaus or put it anoth wai doe mass employ of thi sort have to occur befor practic ar adopt in the auto sector in rastatt or kaiserslautern which were not possibl befor now some ar sai we want to do awai with keep sundai holi noth of the sort is the case but ladi and gentlemen we were well on the wai to make saturdai far holier than sundai ever were that is the point applaus and now at last after go back and forth for far too long we have been abl to updat the law on genet engin all thi is contain in the question will the feder republ of germani our countri be capabl of meet intern competit i cannot repeat often enough that we ar not a rich countri with the except of coal we have scarc ani natur resourc and a word of warn to those who look onli to the short term when it come to coal that thi a short sight polici similar to agricultur there ar area that should not be look at sole in term of the market economi we need to secur our sourc of food through our farmer tomorrow and for decad into the futur we need a sourc of energi and we will need coal as well in the 21st centuri i do not sai thi just becaus i m in hamburg it is no good for a countri with a coastlin with access to the sea to sai we will get out of the shipbuild industri there ar three major area of import with which you won t win the ludwig erhard prize i know but you will secur a piec of the futur for thi reason i sai we need an understand here of the requir necessari to maintain our posit on the world market in other word we did not get much wors than the other thei got better we us to talk just about taiwan and japan and now my friend the competit is at our own front door and we want it thi wai it is of elementari import to our secur that the russian the ukrainian the czech and the pole find their econom feet as soon as possibl and that thei becom truli abl to feed themselv at our own front door in the czech republ thei have a countri which is home to on of the most intellig peopl in europ and if 3 mark dm ar paid for a skill engin worker at a major european compani in thi countri in bruenn brno and 40 ar paid in mannheim the trend is clear to anyon thi cannot mean that we go down from 40dm nor can it mean that thei stai at 3dm but we must make a real mental effort in order to make up to a certain extent what we ar lose in term of our futur develop that mean invest in first class educ and qualif for worker furthermor improv the infrastructur i have alreadi spoken about railroad about postal servic we can do mani thing differ here what our local state chairman ha just written to the mayor of hamburg is part of all thi concern the transrapid fast rout from hamburg to berlin it mean look after the medium size compani ladi and gentlemen we have no problem with multicultur paus we have no problem with larg compani we have no problem with europ wide worldwid compani we ar grate for everi job howev erhard s polici wa alwai to recogn that what in those dai wa word indistinct is medium size compani in our economi that is the drive dynam forc that must becom clear again along with all that it involv applaus thi entail someth els as well thi will plai a major role at thi parti confer and i am in favor of it the ration link of the environ and the economi of ecolog and the economi i would far prefer to us the word creation rather than environ becaus it contain far more in term of our ethic respons we in our gener do not have the right to let the countri go to the dog from the point of view of the environ and of environment protect if i summar all thi then we need more flexibl we need more innov we need stabil that ha consequ for our budget and our currenc flexibl for exampl mean do what is overdu that is creat more part time job it is incomprehens ladi and gentlemen that 2 5 million peopl in the feder republ who have job sai when ask that thei would like to work part time but for reason that ar quit incomprehens to me moreov in the civil servic which also set a terribl exampl no progress is made here in the netherland everi third employe is a part time employe here it is everi sixth if we introduc the dutch exampl here then we would have some 2 million job we do not need to wait until the year 2000 we can get thi move now the legal base were creat long ago in the agreement in the chemic industri and i would like to give due credit here we have exampl of more flexibl i will sai quit openli i cannot understand at all if a larg trade union such as that in the chemic industri can come to such agreement why should there be seriou talk at the moment about strike and lock out we ar commit a crime against the futur of our countri if we allow ourselv to experi like that right now applaus when i spoke of a rethink with regard to innov and there we have an unusu respons there is also the question of our respons in the past and our respons in the futur for a favor climat for technolog and research in germani ladi and gentlemen we have toler for too long thi nonsens which wa spread about young peopl were persuad thei had to be afraid of take a posit view of life and the futur and should studi for as long as possibl becaus the outsid world wa cold we need young peopl who ar confid and thi attitud ha to be shape at home at school and as far as i m concern now and again dure the sermon on sundai both all three can be veri us for young peopl applaus we ar obvious veri pleas when our sportsmen and women ar success we can see thi as the winter olymp ar now take place the medal will be count and everyon mani peopl will feel person move and the exampl of a young skier is obvious a motiv to hundr of thousand of young peopl to achiev someth themselv why don t we transfer thi experi from the world of sport to the area of technolog and scienc why don t we final sai a firm ye to thi as a prerequisit for a function republ name a ye to an elit of achiev no democraci can exist without an achiev elit and that is particularli evid in thi field applaus friend i am not preach a blind belief in progress here at the end of thi centuri we understand what thi mean progress progress in scienc and technolog must alwai have an ethic basi and respons to ensur that everyth that is feasibl is not necessarili allow but we cannot maintain our live standard and the social secur in our countri if we ar not in the forefront of develop in the world if our compani no longer consid that the result of research will produc more market product thi is not a primari object of polit polit ha to provid the framework and i m in favor of that and industri can quit rightli demand that but ladi and gentlemen when i occasion hear peopl complain about us i think peopl should keep their own hous tidi befor critic us we have made mistak but so have other peopl and if everyon rectifi their own mistak then the countri will have a good futur it s that simpl on more thing is import stabil which will secur the futur we ar all agre on that stabl state financ a stabl mark we cannot increas state debt ani further we reduc the state quota in 1949 in 1982 it ha increas to an intoler level again we cannot continu to increas tax becaus thi will destroi the countri and the peopl s desir to work we have to see econom output in relat to the social welfar state that is why we have to save there is no further scope for the distribut of wealth that is why we sai honestli to on anoth what is possibl and what is not in a countri like germani where social benefit total 1 trillion with a 3 trillion mark gnp a further increas is not possibl that doe not mean we should dismantl the welfar state but we should restructur it we have to combat abus but we ar not just talk of abus of the unemploy benefit system although thei unfortun exist but also of tax and subsidi fraud none of these three ar trivial offens applaus dear friend we must do that and i can onli ask you again and again to tell peopl thi becaus it is the prime basi for our futur idea we must do it in a demograph situat whose effect ar still not understood by mani it is the free decis of the german that we have on of the lowest birth rate in the world for peopl in their 20 s it is gratifi that we have increas life expect in the year 2000 it will be 75 for men and almost 81 for women it is gratifi that we now have more than 3 million person who ar over 80 in germani and you know the effect on the job market the social secur system the economi as a whole ladi and gentlemen the number of pension is rise and so i will sai a frank word about that these pension ar not just anybodi it is the gener of my parent for the young here it is the gener of their grandpar and a pension is not alm given to peopl by the state it is the life s work of a man or a woman if that is the case thei have a right to a secur pension so let s stop experiment specul about thi which can onli make peopl unhappi in the end that cannot be our polici applaus we will stick to the principl of link wage and contribut and secur peopl s live standard in old ag but the statist show someth that is on of the most incomprehens thing nowadai that is the absolut necess for nurs care insur we know and will stick to thi that it must not be an addit burden for the economi thi must be done in such a wai that it is not an addit burden howev we have 1 8 million peopl in need of nurs care in germani and what ar we do now we have 30 dai of vacat we have between 11 and 14 other holidai that make eight week of free time what is import now is not even to cut two dai of vacat but to leav them as thei ar and not to pai for them in holidai pai or to give the worker the opportun to make up for them out of hi leav entitl we wrangl over thi now and the old on i won t sai senior citizen becaus it is much closer to realiti fall by the waysid i find the wai thi matter is be discuss quit intoler applaus if at the same time in german citi the number of singl peopl is increas some 50 percent of the household and of them 6 million peopl between 25 and 65 then it is clear that hardli anyth is chang in the overal climat of the countri at present henc it is not a cdu obsess there ar some strang utter from the fdp that i cannot understand at all when we sai that the topic of famili and children is the central topic when we ar talk about secur the futur in the medium and long term we have alreadi set great thing in motion from famili allow to parent leav and parent leav allow there is also our recognit of time spent rear children for pension purpos and mani other thing thi is not enough howev i promis with a view to the state s financ and our manifesto will look thi wai bar ani great chang in the sum involv dure the next legisl period we will have to do someth in the tax area for industri to promot invest and erad unemploy but we must also take a further step even if it is onli a small on on behalf of famili with children and ladi and gentlemen thi is not just ani old issu which is why i am in favor of a further reduct in the tax burden for rais the level of statutori tax exempt which is anywai necessari for constitut reason in line with subsist level and we will certainli have to discuss a seri of other issu i would howev ask that we discuss thi in privat befor we do so in public ladi and gentlemen applaus but and i add thi by wai of warn becaus i m afraid we have also fallen a littl behind the time as import as all the materi thing ar there is someth far wors to critic name that there is no overse how cold our societi ha becom in it attitud toward children and that thi is at least as signific as anyth we can do in financi term have a posit attitud to children is a wholli person matter where the state ha no busi interf but where children ar present the state ha to act protect in anoth wai and the everi dai life of a famili with children and abov all the everi dai life of singl parent not least singl mother is such that it is depress how societi our societi treat them applaus permit me to sai a few word on the subject of our countri s uniti i said and it is an opinion we all share that we ar happi with the gift of uniti but it is also true that on thi path to uniti we found out that 40 year 40 year of separ had left far deeper mark than we myself includ thought it is also true that overcom the legaci of the sed regim is the central task we face but that s the wai it ha to be and when we distribut public monei we can spend it onli onc and more goe toward east germani than the west then i sai and thi is someth we have to tell peopl as it is also part of the truth that it s now the turn of those who had to wait 40 year and where i come from where the build of a new bridg across the rhine ha been an import issu for 30 year for 30 year we have argu for 30 year we fail to find a suitabl site and now it s the autobahn from rostock to luebeck that ha prioriti becaus without it there can be no develop in mecklenburg west pomerania applaus friend let s not let ourselv be impress by those who sai thei ar speak in the name of the peopl the larg major of our peopl also in the western part of germani know full well that thi theori is correct but what we now need to tackl in addit to what ha to happen on the econom side of thing is the question of the peopl live togeth and thi touch the live of million everi dai i must tell you what repeatedli fill me with constern perhap thi is not the right word hurt me is how littl soul i will us that word is characterist of our contact with on anoth and mani speak condescendingli after 40 year of their experi of the western administr system peopl almost alwai forget what that mean what kind of peopl ar now sit in state feder govern and ar mayor five year ago thei were doctor surgic nurs everyth conceiv now thei ar negoti with intern concern about the set up of car factori and mani other thing of cours not everyth run smoothli anyon who examin local polit in western germani cannot serious sai that everyth is function perfectli there read the local newspap ladi and gentlemen applaus all the peopl i myself includ in the state of former west germani have been impregn and shape over a period of mani year by a certain type of polit you know that if you ar on camera you do up your jacket then you come out with hollow word when you don t want to sai anyth that s the usual cours of thing and then you ar consid right and proper but ladi and gentlemen thi is not possibl when you have live on a differ planet for 40 year if you believ for 40 year that free public opinion wa also your opinion that ha to be learn and i have experienc that from our colleagu in the bundestag and in the cabinet what we need now ar reason talk with on anoth we need to have patienc with on anoth that is the most import thing that we need in germani now applaus but equal part of the pictur is that we tell our compatriot in eastern germani that the standard of live reach in west germani wa not creat in four year but took decad to achiev and that we have to exercis patienc with each other i have no doubt ladi and gentlemen that togeth we can achiev whatev we want despit all the worri and word indistinct which i see and which you can see as well the complet chang in peopl s prospect but when i see for exampl how the road and autobahn look in east germani todai and when i take just as a small exampl the fact that dure the 40 year of the gdr precis 1 8 million telephon line were instal and that in just a few recent year the figur ha been 4 1 million to take on exampl sentenc as heard when i look at the trend in pension a subject particularli close to my heart which amount to 450 to 500 ostmark after 45 work year befor german uniti and which is now 1 250dm then it is justifi that we do so we need make no excus thi is a concret exampl of solidar in practic in germani applaus and i conced everi dai that we have made error i lothar de mazier when we were negoti the agreement at the time wolfgang schauebl and other in april 1990 the gdr asset were estim at 1 trillion mark and we were not the onli on it wa the great econom guru not just here but on the other side of the atlant who made these estim and then we said we would write in the agreement that when everyth had been calcul that which remain detlev rohwedd name a sum of 600 billion the amount would be credit to the then inhabit of the gdr my friend to make sure there s no misunderstand thi wa not 40 year ago it wa four year ago when i recal the bundestag debat on thi i don t want to bore you with it everi other word indistinct would have tortur ourselv if we had said we would not do it the forecast at the time were of an entir differ natur and so i wa wrong as well i did not expect the soviet union to collaps and that 25 billion in trade would have shrunk to around 5 billion and that onli with the help of herm guarante but i wa not wrong on on count first german uniti and second i still maintain even if somewhat later that there will be flourish landscap in the former gdr applaus and my friend the whole world expect thi of us francoi mitterrand ha alwai us the same formula the german have great problem thei would not be proper german if thei did not master them and here come the sentenc which is not my own i quot and afterward thei will be stronger than ever befor and you see thi a central point which face us at the moment it is the question all our neighbor pose what exactli is the matter with you german what do you stand for when volker rueh negoti with a counterpart he is ask well ar you actual allow to do that when the foreign minist goe awai for negoti he come back and sai it wa terribl everyon said thi and that ha to be done but thei all look past me becaus we ar unabl to act you see ladi and gentlemen it goe against the honor if i can put it thi wai it is against the honor and digniti of our countri that we ar a member of the unit nation and can make us of the right thi bring but shirk respons when it come to oblig applaus it doe not speak in our polit favor if we fail to find an answer to thi question and turn instead to karlsruh constitut court with the attitud that it is far easier to unload our burden in karlsruh than to do our duti ourselv it doe not speak in our favor we should stop talk about disillusion with polit when politician ar themselv not capabl of provid the prerequisit necessari for action i think we ar see in these hour and i mean thi quit liter the possibl of a new chanc the wai thing look thi morn the object the nato ultimatum intend to achiev will now be possibl at least in the sarajevo area i myself have contribut over the last few dai and i must sai also the night to the effort to end thi terribl bloodsh these horribl kill first in that place and then elsewher i would like to sai expressli that i welcom the fact that with bori yeltsin and the russian govern anoth import forc ha assum respons i have tri to make great effort to make thi possibl i would also welcom it if over the next few week we do not have much time we could invest all our strength in order to produc an overal plan there ar alreadi some reason piec in order to end the whole suffer in the former yugoslavia and after care prepar to hold a veri high level intern confer we must do all we can to make our contribut to thi within our possibl but thi exampl show that we german do not hide awai in our nich when the storm of histori break out that would not be accept we cannot be on of the strongest countri in europ we cannot want to take on an import role in the world and us the red green coalit in germani s motto when it is to our advantag we will join in when it is not we will leav the plai field and wait in the shower until the storm is over that is not polit that would be a wretch thing for our countri and for thi reason we must also win the elect to ensur that thi wretch thing is not practic throughout the world applaus friend thi kind of polit also includ a clear and unreserv ye to the bundeswehr there ar few thing applaus which have affect me so badli over the last week as the necessari save measur for the bundeswehr and in the area of technic innov thi cannot go on for ever we have to enter area and word indistinct but alongsid the monei it is abov all a question of thought and emot is thi the armi of our children our son or not should we allow a mood to emerg in our countri and societi where soldier ar revil for the servic thei perform or put more amic those who serv ar regard as stupid compar to those who don t that is unaccept applaus my friend given all my respect and i have great respect for young peopl who do altern servic in hospit in word indistinct or elsewher the prioriti li with compulsori militari servic it is import for the futur and i sai with equal clariti i am and remain a convinc support of gener conscript chang thi would chang the fundament structur of our countri thi cannot be state often enough unpleas as it mai be applaus experi in yugoslavia teach us someth els someth of extrem import i think i also have to address thi to myself we have to concentr our argument in the fight for europ s polit uniti increasingli on the truli decis factor we want the polit union of the maastricht treati we want econom and currenc union on the clear cut condit of a stabl economi and abov all a stabl currenc but my friend all thi will be in vain if we fail to maintain peac and freedom in europ the question which face us now after the experi of the last few year and month is is the unif of europ not abov all a question of war and peac in six year the centuri will be over and of cours histori doe not repeat itself entir exactli but there wa a time when aristid briand and gustav stresemann won the nobel peac prize and when everyon almost everyon in europ and germani believ there would never be anoth war between franc and germani eight year later came hitler six year after that the second world war histori doe not repeat itself but doe anyon in thi hall honestli believ that the terribl exampl we see todai of racial hatr and ethnic cleans religi hostil and the worst kind of chauvin in the balkan that these evil spirit onli live there and could never go elsewher can we not hear from other part of europ start in moscow tone which we don t want to attach too much import to them but which at least ought to make us stop and think thi mean that thi countri germani our countri at the center of europ geograph and geopolit the countri with most frontier is link to european unif for good or ill if we go it alon we will onc again go into isol and onc again take the wrong path that is the experi histori show us applaus for thi reason we want to build thi europ as our vision ha alwai been irrespect of what other mai sai for temporari opportunist reason ahead of variou elect that is not our polici it should becom what we have describ in the motion which which will be submit to you tomorrow the shape of the european union ha to be that of a liber democrat feder subsidiar base feder state becaus europ safeguard the futur of nation it also safeguard their ident

my knowledg of histori is of cours much greater therefor at afanasyev s univers at rggu expans unidentifi i teach histori and philosophi rather than philolog i know latin ancient greek french can read german english and italian to learn to speak these languag i would need to have spent less time in prison and more time in contact with foreign sargin have you been arrest often novodvorskaya well let us start with three round under articl 70 alon which wa quit a rariti in the soviet union after all i am 43 not 60 then some small stuff like articl 190 point 2 defac the state flag thi wa under gorbachev then if you count just arrest for particip in ralli 17 instanc of 15 dai detent over two year thi alon add up to more than eight month sargin did thei beat you in prison novodvorskaya thei no longer do that in the post stalin time in lefortovo thei do not engag in beat at all thei have other wai of talk to you those who end up in special prison such as kazan were simpli tortur but in a

novodvorskaya if the ci countri have power over their own fate then of cours the elect would have an impact but i question veri much their abil to control their destini becaus in ukrain those who make the decis ar not khmara or chornovil who could inde make an impact on the destini of their republ but rather homo sovietica from southern and eastern ukrain who vote for kravchuk what is the union of independ state on the on hand a democrat russia on the other ukrain which is also more or less belaru is a communist preserv but in a present form next come feudal turkmenistan and next routin commun

underground prison sargin is it true that you were nearli rape there novodvorskaya no i do not think that i would satisfi the tast of georgian mkhedrioni thankfulli i am not that young and not that good look so i do not think there is ani such danger for me sazhi umalatova is the on who is alwai afraid of be rape becaus she is beauti slim and blond sargin what is your reaction to report about z gamsakhurdia s death novodvorskaya zviad di in battl i know him suicid is 250 percent imposs if he did not kill himself in the seventi and eighti why do it now he ha a greater safeti margin than solzhenitsyn z gamsakhurdia s suicid would mean destroi with hi own hand the caus of hi entir life i will never believ that he would throw down the drain such a wonder opportun as hi own death i think that what is involv here is a design on the part of the georgian and what remain of the russian special servic shevardnadz did not have a guarante that if necessari russia would not trade him for zviad suicid is an elementari trick of special servic although in our countri pugo manag to put hi gun on a night tabl after he kill himself and akhromeyev hung himself with a gun on hand what happen in georgia is precis what our dear friend in civil western countri advis us to do now gamsakhurdia follow their advic and western advic come from incompet and weak peopl when thei give us advic on econom we should listen becaus thei ar knowledg in thi subject howev with respect to our polit affair the destini of russia thei will never understand anyth russia s special road is a veri sudden rout of build a liber societi russia wa hurt most by the wed feast in the kremlin palac of congress on elect night i cannot think of an adequ punish for the organ of thi stupid on cannot sit down at the same tabl as fascist and communist becaus those who sit down with them later ar sent to ga chamber and in principl for a good reason for cowardic weak spineless and lack of principl sargin wa thi not an attempt on the part of the current author to reconcil with the new opposit novodvorskaya there cannot be a reconcili between red and white in russia dure civil war we must win now and not think

shevardnadz vakhtang goguadz s speech should becom a subject of seriou studi i do not think it necessari that the establish of order if we understand thi in it liter sens should be entrust to russia we ourselv should establish order in our own countri a countri that is unabl to establish order doe not deserv independ and will be unabl to preserv it it is a differ matter when what is under discuss

unfortun it transpir that the countri in the shape of the cabinet and parliament wa not prepar to turn toward russia if we had turn toward russia i am convinc that we would have overcom the bank note

speak about in parliament or on televis i think thi should be explain as human weak annoy anger a lack of object and knowledg and at time someth els i repeat that all thi is a detail the most import thing is their servic to thi seriou and histor matter i do not think that 1994 will be a year of ani veri great polit cataclysm i do not think that we should expect ani coup and so forth as thi natur will not bring societi anyth oniani to what extent ar the second stage of the state of emerg and the curfew adopt by parliament be implement in georgia todai shevardnadz i will not be exagger if i sai

the union of georgia s citizen the statut read by the head of state had an optimist ring about them thi gave rise to the follow question oniani is the deepen of relat with russia the reason for thi optim shevardnadz on of the reason is undoubtedli the deepen of relat with russia and with the ci member state in gener sinc our turn toward them mean first and foremost the reviv of econom life and the restor of econom ti thi process ha alreadi begun and it is a veri hope on i am convinc that the first half of thi year will be a period dure which veri intens negoti will be conduct with variou associ depart differ republ oblast and correspond administr howev i think that the second half of the year will be a complet new stage in the econom life of georgia a new stage from the point of view that peopl will begin to work more intens and on a larg scale i hope that the foreign firm that ar come here to carri out work on oil extract have definit expect and god will we will find a littl more oil in georgia there ar also other resourc in particular our coal and certain other altern sourc of energi which will enabl us to be more prepar for next winter winter should not mean an econom freez or the economi come to a halt henc i repeat that the deepen of relat with russia itself and our join the ci mean first and foremost the reviv of the economi and i think that if the economi get go again and in an effect manner peopl will have a better life there is no disput the fact that we have to return to abkhazia how thi should be done is anoth question anoth meet is take place in geneva there ar definit hope that the meet will bring result and if not it doesn t matter our return is inevit furthermor the view exist that our return to abkhazia is connect with the more progress and just posit assum by russia at the same time event focus on georgia that ar take place not onli in russia but also throughout the world in particular the creation of organ and committe in support of us in variou countri more assist invest in the nation economi and humanitarian aid ar also import howev the main thing is order if there is order there will be invest and the flow of capit from differ countri throughout the world and in thi wai the countri will be save thi is what i meant when i said that 1994 should be a turn point sakartvelo respublika editori note the head of state had the follow to sai about the new of the death of the former presid that wa spread last week shevardnadz the death of ani person arous seriou regret in me particularli as the ex presid no longer repres ani kind of seriou polit forc in georgia todai follow those event that took place in western georgia hi ideolog hi world outlook and hi support were defeat in everi wai and from all point of view in accord with all exist law regard those forc that were connect in on wai or anoth with provinci fascism i do not think that we have the right to feel at peac of cours gamsakhurdia wa not alon he wa a politician who adher to the most categor and forward posit howev he had support not onli at the time when as we now sai the nation liber movement embrac the whole of georgia but also later when he wa move on kutaisi and tbilisi there were peopl in mani polit parti that were readi to form an allianc with him if it is possibl to make some kind of forecast it should be said that these forc will try to creat a new organ that is not so much radic but nevertheless neo fascist or profascist in it orient and if thei succe and come to power thei will conduct the same polici that were implement by gamsakhurdia therefor we have to be care and vigil i do not know whether anyon ha wit gamsakhurdia s burial and we do not know where hi grave is the area in which it is suppos to be is so we ar told still under the control of a small group of hi support who ar quit well arm we do not want there to be ani kind of bloodsh and therefor we ar not move in there it ha been confirm in groznyi that he inde commit suicid accord to inform brought by our deleg he wife sai the same thing there is now a veri big debat go on regard where he should be buri or laid to rest in my view hi famili should decid thi question if as i am be told it is the wish of hi famili that he be definit buri in groznyi he found refug there and thi will be no misfortun we will not oppos thi if hi famili should want hi grave to be in georgia thi is also up to them on thing howev is essenti a seriou examin of the bodi should be carri out with the particip of intern expert so that all other version of hi death can be either exclud or confirm some peopl ar sai that he did not commit suicid that certain forc close to him decid that he wa no longer need for anyth and as thei sai settl score with him perhap thi is gossip perhap it s the truth therefor a legal medic examin should in ani case be carri out thi is my view oniani todai fascism ha becom a seriou forc in russia it therefor seem paradox that georgia is take a seriou step toward russia precis now shevardnadz the express of a special solidar with presid yeltsin wa felt at the meet in ashgabat i think thi wa precis becaus there wa such a real danger of fascism appear on the larg polit arena and not onli georgia but also all the ci member state specif want and have to adopt the decis to help russia s democrat forc in the struggl to overcom thi terribl sick i believ that the same feel exist in the west in particular in the us administr and europ s lead and non lead nation that believ that russia s democraci need help if russia s democraci is save i believ thi is how the question should be put will it be save or not then life on our planet will becom stabl and assum a normal charact so russia s intern problem ar now no longer it problem

concern the primit level of polit cultur on which thi state rest in essenc it ha much in common with communist collectiv but differ from it in be base not on ideolog but on nepot region ti and other primit criteria in both case the polit result is hatr for free men and in the constitut sens free citizen as a result those who wield power todai who found themselv at the head of the democrat

such fine poem and stori an unwash unshaven long hair individu to hit him with brass knuckl these son of cun father as lermontov onc call those who order the murder of poet should at least teach their

name in their mouth the state also ha the hitman of tirana on it side thi is a veri seriou matter just like the mateotti crime in itali and the state is oblig to speak out either it must publicli

border first of all peopl will tear it down and second we will lose not onli our shirt but our underwear as well for exampl the length of russia s border with kazakhstan is 7 559 km on kilomet cost 1 billion rubl mere to build the border itself without ani infrastructur hous and so forth we would requir 7 6 trillion which is 150 percent more than all our current expenditur on maintain the border

border is both a sanitari checkpoint and a limit where we can confront forc engag in intellig activ at the same time it should not be close and under no circumst should it act as a barrier to good let

came to power a second time not when hi brigad seiz lanchkhuti and prepar to storm tbilisi but on 3 4 octob if the moscow putsch had succeed gamsakhurdia would have been in shevardnadz s place right now don t forget he live in chechnya near dudayev and dudayev is khasbulatov so there is a direct link between them had a chechen come to power in moscow then the chechen proteg gamsakhurdia would

own peopl especi sinc he enjoi an author and trust in the world and that wa veri import at that moment after all we had come to power by mean of an arm revolt and the world did not trust us shevardnadz s come to power unfortun made sens in a post communist state we have other exampl azerbaijan turkmenistan other republ but shevardnadz want to make great polici in a small state when he wa

the post mortem carri out in israel by dr iain west head of forens medicin at gui s hospit and two isra pathologist with the famili s approv found seriou muscl tear and injuri to the left hand and left shoulder the pathologist believ thi suggest that maxwel hung on to someth befor fall into the water these crucial find were not discov by the earlier spanish autopsi maxwel could have sustain such an injuri by hold on to prevent himself from fall by accid or by try to hoist himself back again but west suggest that maxwel could have also sustain such an injuri as he deliber took hi own life west believ such an injuri could have been incur by climb over the rail and slip while still hold the rail but it could also be a crucial clue point to suicid on see thi pattern of injuri on occas in individu who kill themselv as a result of fall from high build while some will jump or let themselv toppl over a bacloni or out of a window other will actual will eas themselv over the edg and hold on

howev on of hi lead doctor maintain that he wa healthi befor leav on hi final cruis test carri out by spanish pathologist show some evid of ischem myocardi damag in layman s term hi heart muscl were

found difficulti in perform hi examin becaus of the poor state in which the bodi reach him it had been poorli embalm some part of the bodi were in an advanc state of decomposit other were miss have been sent to madrid for separ analysi by the spanish pathologist but dr west wa unconvinc of the theori that maxwel had suffer a big enough heart attack while on board to send him toppl overboard he conclud that while maxwel had undoubtedli suffer a degre of heart damag there wa no evid of a massiv coronari dr west on the other hand conced that maxwel could have suffer a heart attack while in the water in thi at least the pathologist concur the other crucial find by both autopsi wa that there wa no conclus evid that the sole caus of death wa by drown follow test on maxwel s lung and sampl taken from the sea water dr west conclud that maxwel s injuri do not point to a clearli defin caus of death the most like conclus that can be drawn from both autopsi is that the physic caus of death wa most probabl a combin of a heart attack and drown while struggl in the water so how did maxwel die on the evid avail both murder for which there is no physic evid and a heart attack as a singl caus of death can probabl be rule out thi leav on of two possibl maxwel either fell into the water by accid or he commit suicid neither can be rule out on the basi of the forens evid rankin told maxwel s

mr bill grai as haitian special envoi he wa a leader of the black congression caucu for year befor retir in 1992 as it stand at present the caucu is not displeas with the direct of us polici but ani backtrack by the presid carri clear risk republican long distrust of fr aristid claim that the caucu ha hijack haitian polici recent mr dick chenei the former defenc secretari and prospect presidenti candid sarcast paint the imaginari scene of what would have happen if he had gone into presid ronald reagan and told him that randal robinson wa on hunger strike and that therefor haitian polici had to be chang but the stronger republican hand rest on the whole question of invas senat robert dole the minor leader laid down hi marker last week by get the senat to pass unanim a non bind resolut requir mr clinton to seek the approv of congress befor despatch troop the presid diplomat repli that he hope to have the support of congress but ad like my predecessor of both parti i have not agre that i wa constitution mandat to get it thi wa inde presid bush s posit befor the gulf war but he still found it polit to secur congression assent as a practic matter it probabl make sens to plai down talk of invas while keep up the pressur on the haitian junta thu leav congress free to focu on healthcar and crime but it would onli take some egregi atroc in haiti itself to throw that calcul out of the window the senat vote and plenti of other poll evid suggest that mr clinton would be disappoint if he sought to restor hi popular by rememb the mayaguez the rescu in 1975 of us sailor captur by north korea which sharpli boost presid ford s stand there ar some suggest he might invad haiti anywai if onli to assuag the pain if healthcar fail but that would realli bring congress down on hi head mayb mr clinton wa lucki that he got onli two question on haiti last week at least hi answer to on of them wa hi most concis explan yet of why the us should deem it of vital interest i think our secur is caught up in whether the peopl in thi hemispher ar move toward democraci and open market and observ of the rule of law if you look at the possibl ramif of the violat of the junta in haiti on other countri in the caribbean and central and south america that is where our secur interest is but thi came late in the game inde the broader question now on haiti as on so mani other issu is whether the

that thei did in thi kind of murder there wa someth but what you can t go back 20 year later and put it togeth so i m sure there ar a lot of case like that that have slip through the crack but to leap from there to the conclus that whoever commit such a crime had to be under the influenc of satan is someth that gallant and most other occult investig sai thei ar simpli not will to do the stori mai be true thei sai but thei remain unproven even the exist of the devil or god or moham or ani other deiti ha so far been imposs to prove for most of us gallant sai and i can give myself as an exampl

hi script cram page full of footnot and so forth fill with all kind of human detail as well as the repli brief he watch clau on two barbara walter interview after each trial and read transcript of the first trial as well as 2 000 page of clau deposit in respons to a civil suit that had been file against him by the von auersperg children and kazan research materi purport to tell the other side kazan said he elabor on dialogu and charact though not on actual event other than for dramat compress clau wa easi to embellish becaus he s kind of a rococo figur said kazan hi sens of himself what do you give a wife who ha everyth an inject of insulin it s like that these joke he repeat so frequent give you a sens of plai which is excit comic and terrifi simultan the trick with clau is everyon see him as be kind of devilish and part of my job wa to make him a human be also with sunni kazan continu i have affidavit about her fall down in public parti and drink and smear lipstick all over her face these ar deposit which clau got from peopl in newport for the appeal then there wa clau civil deposit on ha to look at that with a certain amount of skeptic but he s not ly for 2 000 page so the trick is to take everyth her pattern of self destruct all the pill aspirin constantli up to 20 lax a dai chain smoke cigarett three or four pack a dai thi woman wa realli on a collis cours and she stai in

were constraint work on the script wa a nightmar from a legal standpoint note kazan becaus the assumpt is everyon s go to come out of the woodwork everyon is go to sue and a lot of the peopl who ar go to sue ar veri rich everi time there wa a revis we had to go to the lawyer if an actor had a problem with a line you d rewrit the line and go the lawyer then the lawyer would send it to the insur agent how do you make a movi about a woman in a coma even take into account the flashback glenn close said her charact is realli the movi s leitmotif her role wa shot in the first three week of product while certainli in size of role jeremi and ron silver ar carri the weight of the movi schroeder enjoi the contrast in their charact i see von bulow as total amor and pleasur love who s bore to death when he s with hi wife but who ha a lot of fun when he s in troubl noth matter ultim noth ha ani import that s a veri unusu charact and what i like wa the confront between those two dershowitz and him and that s the heart of the movi of cours basic you have the idea also of life versu death continu the director becaus the surround of von bulow in hi big hous is veri cold and the surround of dershowitz is all these young student and that is veri excit too von bulow ha a dandi libertin detach view of the world on the contrari for dershowitz justic is almost like a religion thing do matter even if it s for the idea of justic to free someon that mayb is not complet innoc not complet innoc the possibl of hi guilt ha to be there otherwis the movi doesn t work dramat schroeder said not that he inject hi wife with insulin for that charg wa complet ludicr but that von bulow is somehow respons perhap guilti he suggest reluctantli of have collabor with hi wife in order to have her die she mai have attempt to commit suicid and he mai have facilit that and kazan point out that there is consider evid if you read the book that sunni wa suicid three week befor the final coma sunni took 65 aspirin dershowitz suggest that von bulow wa frozen with indecis about call the doctor at the time of the first coma becaus he doesn t know how sick she is the maid is sai call the doctor he s sai she wouldn t want me to call the doctor she doesn t like invas of her privaci she doesn t like the doctor in newport don t worri she s done thi befor and then in retrospect it wa much wors than he thought there s noth in the second coma he learn from the first coma that he had been wrong and he call immedi shortli after hi acquitt von bulow told dershowitz he thought robert duval ought to plai him in the movi which dershowitz duli report in the book now live in england and accord to dershowitz do charit work von bulow plai no role in the make of revers of fortun on of the stipul between him and sunni s older children in settl the civil suit wa that he maintain silenc on the case howev dershowitz did confid go into an ever so slight imit of hi client s voic you know i m not allow to talk about thi film and i m as anxiou as ani subject would be he s heard veri good thing about jeremi dershowitz ad he wa just a bit concern jeremi iron didn t have hi accent right he said jeremi iron ha
