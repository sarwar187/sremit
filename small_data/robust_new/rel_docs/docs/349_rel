hi enclos patient veri good just a few minut more it s not a particularli cheer assign for ross a distinguish affabl british scientist who recent join the staff of the huntington medic research institut hi patient ha a malign of the brain a tumor so larg it cannot be remov by surgeri or treat by radiat or chemotherapi for the patient the convent weapon of oncolog have been exhaust i suppos you could sai that by ani exist medic measur ross sai he s under a death sentenc yet the huntington s doctor have not given up on m as part of a bold experiment program for patient beyond the pale of other treatment he is receiv a radic new therapi it object to stir the patient s own immun system back to life so it can fight the grow cancer m s doctor at the huntington medic center have taken some of hi white blood cell or lymphocyt part of the immun system s weapon against invad and mix them with interleukin 2 a natur occur chemic messeng us by the bodi to prod the lymphocyt into renew activ human interleukin 2 is so hard to obtain in ani quantiti that doctor ar forc to us an ident genet engin substitut the mixtur ha been in ject directli into m s tumor in hope that the reviv lymphocyt will begin attack the rapidli divid cancer cell is the novel treatment work ha it reduc the size of tumor x rai can t realli show us sai ross by the time we could detect a chang it might well be too late the onli other method would be to open the skull to take a biopsi but such a surgic procedur is out of the question for the severli weaken patient so ross must us some other mean to peer insid m s brain that is the purpos of their trip to san francisco the examin of m involv an experiment techniqu call magnet reson spectroscopi mr it is vagu reminisc of a ct comput tomographi scan which us x rai and comput technolog to provid view of virtual ani part of the bodi a physician mai want to see but the similar is onli superfici the machin doesn t probe with x rai it ferret out the bodi s inner secret by listen to it own signal the faint emiss given off by it constitu atom and molecul includ those of m s massiv tumor to get the tumor tissu to talk to reveal whether it ha been affect by the experi mental treatment the machin reli on an extrem intens magnet field thousand stronger then the earth s accompani by puls of radio wave the puls evok faint electromagnet echo from m s tumor which ar a tip off to it chemic state thi diagnost wizardri is base on a techniqu known as nuclear magnet reson the idea date to the 1940s is old hat to physicist and chemist stanford s felix bloch and harvard s edward purcel share the 1952 nobel prize in physic for develop it it ha long been us for studi nonliv materi but onli now is it begin to touch diagnost medicin studi live thing alreadi the result ar littl short of revolutionari as ross explain we re abl to see aspect of live tissu that have never befor been visibl other than by cut or other invas techniqu the potenti of the techniqu is enorm if we can monitor the biochem process of a diseas noninvas it will sure give us an earli insight into the natur of the diseas and it respons to treatment magnet reson hold promis not onli for cancer but for heart attack brain and spinal injuri and a varieti of muscl weaken diseas includ multipl sclerosi research sai the revolut of magnet reson doctor have drop the word nuclear lest it unnecessarili frighten their patient is take shape in two distinct wai mr which pinpoint and measur kei bodili chemic like those that mai be feed the fire of m s brain tumor and mri magnet reson imag which produc actual imag x rai like slice of the bodi though bare a decad old mri is clearli on of the hottest area of diagnost medicin some 1 200 scanner ar in us around the countri cost up to 3 million each and mri is rapidli close the gap with ct scan as a wai of probe the bodi in the next few year the number of machin mai well doubl as manufactur such as gener electr philip picker and diason all of whom current manufactur magnet reson devic compet for what is alreadi a billion dollar a year scanner market it s been take off like a rocket ross sai the enthusiasm of doctor for the new technolog is easi to understand mri not onli avoid potenti harm ioniz radiat such as x rai but also produc imag of astonish clariti reveal the outlin of soft tissu like tumor which ar beyond the reach of x rai and could be studi until now onli by biopsi or the inject of radioisotop the idea of magnet creat imag wa first propos in the unit state after the advent of the requir superconduct magnet typic chill by liquid helium down to 450 degre fahrenheit onli four degre abov absolut zero and high speed comput graphic but the actual develop of the new technolog wa left to the british in 1973 a group in aberdeen scotland an offshoot of a pioneer team at the univers of nottingham obtain the first whole bodi imag of a live creatur us magnet reson it wa a cross section of a mous but the british mous didn t roar for long leadership in the field quickli pass back to the unit state we british seem to have a gift for let technolog slip out of our grasp sai ross who is himself join the brain drain of worker in the field when he came to huntington last year to direct it spectroscopi unit each of the major group in the state ha been head at on time or anoth by an englishman ross sai under the leadership of ross s american colleagu dr william g bradlei huntington s imag unit had alreadi becom the busiest in the world sinc it began oper in 1983 it ha perform more than 18 000 mri scan but it is mr that ross and hi colleagu in the unit state and abroad believ mai hold even greater promis though it ha actual been around longer than mri mr is far less familiar and is in it experiment infanc it doesn t produc imag just squiggl sai ross but to know ey like hi thei ar as meaning as ani pictur ross s squiggl ar the spectra or fingerprint if you will of the bodi s chemic jog by radio wave in the presenc of the magnet s power field each of the target compound respond in a uniqu characterist wai transmit it own jag spike signatur to the monitor unfortun sai ross that s the sort of thing even train md aren t alwai comfort with thei ar us to and prefer look at imag it remind them of the biochemistri cours that thei came to hate in colleg or medic school partli for thi psycholog reason but also becaus it requir more power magnet mr ha been much slower to catch on than it younger sibl mri but ross and other predict that situat will chang when it doe thei sai the diagnosi and treatment of certain cancer and other diseas will be significantli advanc mr is avail onli at a few place such as the diason plant the veteran administr medic center in san francisco and duke univers on an experiment basi to select patient like ross s m huntington is instal a power new magnet capabl of produc a field of 1 5 tesla about 30 000 time the strength of the earth s magnet field that will be share by both bradlei s imag team and ross s spectroscopist but if ross and hi colleagu have their wai it will soon move out of the experiment stage and into medicin s mainstream dr michael c weiner who run the mr lab at the va hospit in san francisco is sure that dai is rapidli approach thi techniqu allow us to see how the cell ar work sai the 48 year old transplant new yorker without cut or needl without x rai without ani harm radiat just magnet and radio wave even if it shun scalpel weiner s lab ha certainli been on the cut edg in close collabor with the univers of california san francisco medic center it is us mr to unravel the chemistri of heart attack of brain and spinal injuri even of muscl fatigu the later surprisingli still larg a mysteri even after mani year of research in a cleverli design seri of experi healthi young men flex their muscl in a special built exercis while mr scrutin the metabol chemistri of their exert as thei exercis the expect biochem chang were document the store of the metabolit phosphocreatin in their muscl decreas the synthesi of atp an energi store compound that fuel cellular activ drop off the concentr of lactic acid rose eventu the muscl no longer would contract such studi aren t mere help to would be jock sai uc san francisco s dr robert g miller thei mai eventu aid those who suffer from such muscl weaken diseas as multipl sclerosi myasthenia gravi and amyotroph later sclerosi lou gehrig s diseas at last year s annual meet of the societi of magnet reson in medicin held in san francisco dozen of doctor flock to the basement lab to see for themselv the big magnet where these and other mr experi have been done of special interest to doctor is the metabol of cancer cell while chemotherapi and radiat have score some major success in control their rapid growth oncologist work larg in the dark as thei try to estim what dosag and combin of drug and radiat will work huntington s bradlei sum up the situat we re still in the stone ag when it come to treat cancer the metabol of cancer cell fluctuat from dai to dai yet we dose patient with drug and radiat without ani idea of what stage the cell ar in at the particular moment of treatment that could soon chang becaus mr can detect shift in cellular metabol almost as soon as thei occur in a recent experi on himself dr jame w prichard at yale univers imbib some champagn underw a brain scan and almost immedi found a sharp ethanol alcohol spike it repres the chemic chang induc in the cell of hi brain by the bubbl similarli west german doctor us magnet reson spectroscopi have been abl to track chemic chang in the brain s visual center when the ey open and when thei close by look for chemicalk chang in respons to physic stimuli the techniqu could be us to map other area of the brain an organ that still remain someth of a mysteri in ani case the rapid detect of chemic chang mai enabl doctor to pick the precis moment that cancer cell ar most recept to chemotherapi and almost immedi after the anti cancer drug ar administ mr could be us to monitor their effect against the target cell no longer would doctor have to wait week or month to look for shrinkag or growth of a tumor in fact it wa in quest of just such an assess that ross flew to san francisco with hi cancer ridden patient the examin let us detect a number of thing that tell us someth about the reaction of the tumor cell to the treatment he explain we can for exampl detect the presenc or absenc of atp we can also pick up other metabolit as well as inorgan phosphat and even ph or cellular acid the rel amount detect as measur by the size of the squiggl on the monitor of hi machin ar a precis indic of whether a cluster of cancer cell is grow or be held in check the kei sai ross is phosphocreatin becaus if it level return to normal you know that the patient is most probabl respond to the treatment phosphocreatin is a sensit indic of a deplet energi state success treatment is also like to be signal by a rise in the level of inorgan phosphat sinc thi is a breakdown product of dy cell the biochem intricaci of such measur do not faze ross a specialist in metabol diseas who studi biochemistri under nobel laureat sir han kreb hi first clinic triumph with mr came at oxford in 1981 it involv a retir sailor plagu by continu fatigu ross suspect mcardl s syndrom a rare genet diseas in which the muscl can t break down the sugar glycogen us as a sourc of energi to fuel contract the diseas could have been confirm by biopsi or complex chemic test but he wa determin to provid a diagnosi simpli and noninva sive us a magnet just big enough to enclos the patient s arm he chart precis the expect defici in the man s muscl metabol and dramat confirm hi hunch the man had the muscl weaken syndrom ross s diagnost feat wa glowingli receiv the introduct of a new techniqu to the bedsid alwai stimul intellectu reverber that go beyond the narrow rang of the instrument editori the new england journal of medicin perhap the most import contribut of mr to clinic medicin will be that it will make us start think about familiar diseas in a new wai bradlei who help recruit ross to pasadena call spectroscopi a techniqu look for an applic we have hundr of spectroscopist that would like to do their trade in a medic environ instead of high falutin laboratori scienc thei want to bring spectroscopi down to earth and do it in a worthwhil wai that will help patient brian is try to do that it s now late in the dai ross ha finish hi work with m at the factori site and the men ar head back to san francisco airport what did you learn doc m ask ross smile i d sai that for now the new is good the tumor hasn t grown in a few week doctor and patient will return to san
