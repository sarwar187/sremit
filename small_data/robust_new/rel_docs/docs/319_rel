to sai how much it will cost there is talk it will amount to billion of french franc and all for the sake of result which at least accord to independ nuclear expert will be of littl interest around the world there ar no current industri applic for superphoenix as a sub gener assum it oper at full power which it ha not done sinc 1988 a superphoenix reactor can consum onli 200 kilogram annual of the plutonium end product a highli toxic wast produc by ordinari nuclear reactor franc s 60 reactor creat 11 ton a year of it thu if on were to us the inciner techniqu to solv todai s nuclear wast

edouard balladur s decis impli that the veri small alpin lobbi carri veri littl weight against the massiv nuclear industri lobbi inde what gerard longuet and francoi fillon said yesterdai wa larg deriv from a 1993 report submit by jean teillac former high commission for the atom energi commiss cea from a strictli technic perspect superphoenix pose a seriou question for the govern will there be ani need for breeder reactor technolog over the next two or three decad the crei malvil reactor wa design in the 1970s to make franc self suffici in nuclear fuel at a time when the first oil crisi wa bring to an end the thirti gloriou year i e after world war ii sinc then the market for such fuel ha taken a perman nosed and enthusiasm for nuclear energi wane follow the implos at three mile island unit state 1979 and the explos at chernobyl ukrain 1986 final from a technic standpoint the crei malvil prototyp ha been noth but troubl the most recent debacl juli 1990 led to a temporari shutdown of the reactor it ha never been restart and as a result of variou jurid maneuv it wa depriv in juli 1992 of it legal statu which onli recent ha been restor opposit superphoenix ha serv abov all as a focal point for the never held debat on the gener direct of a french nuclear polici that ha diverg from european norm a debat first of all within franc itself and in the countri on it border in tradition antinuclear itali of cours although the countri s scrupl never prevent it from bui french electr but also in switzerland geneva state counselor claud haegi said yesterdai that if the decis is ultim made to restart it geneva would express it opposit most reaction yesterdai were predict local near the power plant and so depend on them econom express satisfact on the other hand all the countri s environmentalist movement greenpeac the european against superphoenix associ etc noisili express their indign the govern is gambl that oppon will not be abl to forg an effect coalit and there were two argument that outweigh other consider for the govern obvious sensit to the vulner of a nuclear industri that is as unhappi as it oppon ar about crei malvil and what it ha come to symbol it wa simpli unthink for superphoenix to be shut down in the final analysi as the edf french power compani and cea have constantli reaffirm sinc 1989 the facil wa indispens to franc s futur first for

nation electr power board and 16 percent by germani s rwe rhine westphalian electr work shut down the reactor would requir a reimburs of the foreign partner who suppli some fr50 billion of the monei the reactor ha alreadi consum no on yesterdai wa abl to provid a precis figur but the partnership contract reportedli wa craft carefulli enough that fr18 billion of that monei probabl would have to be

and a discuss of countermeasur text editor s note we cannot just sit idli by look at the varieti of action that all countri of the world have taken to develop new energi resourc and the strateg trend thei have reveal thei show us that a larg energi consum nation that basic ha a singl energi resourc structur compos of coal must take notic of the prospect and signific of the new energi resourc of the 21st centuri from the perspect of strateg transit and must start earli in make the correspond polici decis and deploy for thi reason we have ask some expert and scholar to conduct a discuss we ar now publish the main point of repres speech given at the symposium to attract the attent of reader in all area i the statu of develop new energi resourc in our overal nation econom situat i bring up thi issu becaus veri few peopl have mention new energi resourc in the process of acceler the develop of china s nation economi on the on hand peopl not in the energi resourc trench do not understand new energi resourc veri well while on the other hand peopl in these trench feel that new energi resourc do not requir the solut of major problem a failur to resolv thi problem of understand mai caus china s new energi resourc industri to miss the favor opportun of the present time slow our progress in develop new energi resourc and therebi affect china s futur energi resourc strategi of the 21st centuri therefor it is necessari that i summar here the import statu and role of new energi resourc in the develop of our nation economi concept that the chines peopl do not understand clearli and that peopl have not yet accept new energi resourc is the gener name us internation for solar power wind energi marin energi geotherm energi biomass energi and fuel cell becaus solar power wind energi marin energi geotherm energi and biomass energi ar character by be renew thei ar call renew energi resourc at present new energi resourc ar energi resourc that mankind util in a transit to a new state and thei have been receiv grow attent sinc the petroleum crisi of the 1970s the technolog for their applic ha been develop quickli and thei ar move toward greater matur and the achiev of commerci so that new energi resourc ar form forc of product in energi resourc system and occupi a first class statu in the energi resourc structur for the past sever year mani author in energi resourc and econom have explain in scientif technic econom and polit term that while the 20th centuri wa the petroleum and hydrocarbon era major chang will occur dure the 21st centuri becaus of the effect of scientif and technolog develop and breakthrough restrict by the global environ the need for sustain social develop econom and polit factor and so on mankind is now start to enter the era of renew energi resourc at present the total amount of energi resourc consum each year global is onli equival to the amount of energi irradi onto the earth s surfac from the sun in 40 minut which mean that solar energi is 13 000 time the amount of energi consum in the world solar power is energi that caus absolut no pollut and all renew energi resourc includ solar energi wind power water energi biomass energi and so on come from solar energi in the next centuri as we face the dual crise of convent fuel becom exhaust and the environment pollut thei caus new energi resourc will develop further thu energi and econom expert and author with long term view ar call for the entir world to take action in a major effort to develop and util new energi resourc china is a big produc and consum of energi resourc and coal domin our energi resourc util account for about 75 percent of primari energi resourc within the forese futur coal will continu to be china s main energi resourc china s coal output mai reach 1 4 billion ton in 2000 as our economi quickli grow china s energi resourc structur in which coal is the primari factor will face two big problem on is the extrem uneven geograph distribut of our coal resourc and the ever grow pressur on transport some 79 8 percent of china s current proven coal reserv ar concentr in north and northwest china and most other region reli mainli on railwai transport for the coal thei us a substanti portion of china s railwai transport capac is us to haul coal which ha result in long term shortag of railwai transport capac that have been hard to chang the second problem is the increasingli seriou atmospher pollut and ecolog destruct that result from burn larg amount of coal which ha attract attent in china and foreign countri china now gener about 15 million ton of carbon dioxid annual and is on of the largest sourc of co sup 2 in the world moreov becaus of the effect geograph restrict decentr and fluctuat load the economi and other factor china still ha sever region that will face difficulti in ensur suppli of convent energi resourc for a rel long period these problem will vex china s energi resourc industri and even develop of our nation economi for a period into the futur how can we resolv them in the long term on feasibl method is to formul and implement a develop strategi for the diversif of our energi resourc structur in a major effort to develop new energi resourc renew energi resourc in realiti china s energi resourc ar character by a divers resourc structur besid have extrem abund coal petroleum and natur ga miner energi resourc we

advantag of the sol gel process is it flexibl in manag the shape composit and properti of product thi process make it possibl to form ultra micro monodispers powder as well as rel larg integr mold piec for shape to mix compon on an extrem small scale for composit and to control densiti as well as poros for properti thi is the reason why the sol gel process ha come to be appli extens in area outsid nuclear reactor fuel it is not easi to defin the sol gel process clearli in the narrow sens it is a process to turn 1 a suspens sol of metal compound particl as a start materi 2 into an intermedi materi by liver and 3 to acquir ceram product by burn it the method us at jaeri to compound thorium oxid fuel microspher is equival to a typic sol gel process with the method us at jaeri a thoria sol is produc by ad ammonia ga to a thorium nitrat solut a featur of thi method is to control the develop process of colloid particl in the sol by adjust the ph of the solut an effect wai to prevent crack and deform of microspher by shrinkag in the subsequ gell process is to increas the size of colloid particl in the sol and to increas the colloid content figur iv 1 micro gel sphere obtain thi wai ar transform to high densiti microspher of tho sup 2 and th u o sub 2 by thermal process the particl size of microspher can be control by chang the drop condit such as the nozzl size

with it first although we can acknowledg that our govern s abil to collect intellig is clearli limit becaus it ha no independ reconnaiss satellit it did not come up with an appropri respons when the dprk nuclear issu wa first rais or when the dprk admit to possess plutonium the dprk nuclear issu wa brought up a long time ago even when some expert warn of the possibl of a dprk style ncnd the govern show no movement on thi whatsoev it wa onli when the domest media start make an uproar that it began to seek a solut to the problem second in it approach to the nuclear issu the govern wa unabl to secur our interest due to a lack of expert knowledg our nuclear polici can be gener divid into two categori nuclear possess polici and non possess polici pursu by the five nuclear power the us russia china the unit kingdom and franc the nuclear possess polici maxim militari polit and diplomat nation interest by maintain nuclear weapon although it give up nuclear weapon surrend to the pressur of the nuclear power the non possess polici seek to maxim nation interest within given condit by obtain econom and diplomat concess while argu against inequ for variou reason such as our allianc with the unit state we have had no choic but to adopt a non possess polici ar we then get concess unfortun we ar not our govern proclaim it renunci of nuclear weapon and even elucid that it would not maintain the enrich and reprocess facil so necessari for the peac us of nuclear energi and for deal with nuclear wast the is no nation on earth like our thi wa the first time we surrend our autonom nuclear polici as a minimum concess for give up nuclear weapon we should have at least obtain a us effort to reduc trade pressur such as pressur to open our market third the fact that we accept as is the us worldwid nuclear polici and it nuclear polici toward the korean peninsula clearli show our lack of an autonom nuclear polici we have overlook the fact that nuclear polit aris in the world of the zero sum game in which on side lose as much as the other side gain our lack of an autonom nuclear polici becom even clearer when we look back on us interfer in our nuclear develop the ambiti nuclear develop program pursu by presid pak chung hi in the 1970s wa frustrat by the us of cours it can be said that he brought thi on himself becaus he pursu it with openli militari object sinc then even the possess of enrich and reprocess facil for peac us ha been suppress in 1976 a plan to import a nuclear research reactor from canada came to noth and a plan to import mix nuclear fuel technolog from belgium wa also discontinu becaus of us pressur the us ha appli a first supress then see style of pressur against even nuclear technolog unrel to nuclear bomb consid the elimin of the seed of misfortun which mai result from the develop of nuclear weapon more import than the econom loss of a friendli nation the us nuclear weapon prevent polici is directli appli to our industri polici the fourth blunder of the 6th republ wa to includ the non possess of enrich and reprocess facil in it prohibit against nuclear weapon with it denuclear declar let us sai that it wa a good thing to declar our abandon of nuclear weapon consid the present intern order keep small countri from possess nuclear weapon it is true that an attempt to possess nuclear weapon would not be in our nation interest howev why did we declar that we would not maintain enrich and reprocess facil the govern did not have to includ the renunci of enrich and reprocess facil in it denuclear declar but it did thi declar wa onli in the interest of the unit state which view the growth of our militari and econom nuclear potenti as contrari to it nation interest it ha long classifi the rok as a nation have the potenti to possess nuclear weapon and surround nation thi is becaus enrich and reprocess ar core technolog essenti for the nuclear energi industri although thei ar also need in manufactur nuclear bomb becaus of thi if a nation receiv intern inspect then there is not the least legal problem with maintain these facil thu a legal basi capabl of freez the rok nuclear potenti and close the dprk nuclear facil within the north south joint denuclear declar which includ the abandon of our enrich and reprocess facil is for the unit state and surround nation a mechan by which thei can effortlessli achiev their aim ultim our non nuclear polici conform well with the composit of superpow hegemoni thu the nuclear polici of the 6th republ wa total ill suit for secur our interest thi 6th republ s nuclear polici failur left the new govern with press problem that is with nuclear task and dilemma it must resolv these ar urgent issu the new govern must confront and solv the first dilemma is the possibl that the dprk possess nuclear weapon even though the dprk ha not openli proclaim that it possess nuclear weapon the probabl is grow that it will carri out it own style uncertainti strategi sign of thi ar alreadi appear for thi strategi to succe it must indirectli obscur it abil to possess nuclear weapon the dprk alreadi boast reprocess capabl even while awar that it is a violat of the joint denuclear declar it ha admit to possess plutonium also it ha carri out approxim 70 deton test and left sign of thi even while show sign that it is develop nuclear weapon such as rumor it is smuggl plutonium offici it still maintain that it ha neither the abil nor the intent to develop such weapon to put it anoth wai contrari to our govern s cast off of all such capabl by it nuclear free and joint denuclear declar the dprk ha trick us with the joint declar and ha been success enough in drag out the nuclear issu to be a psycholog burden to us second we still need to decid on a postur concern the possibl of sanction by the intern commun against the dprk if the dprk is decept in the inspect and continu it develop of nuclear weapon there is a possibl the situat could develop into a head on collis with the nuclear hegemoni of the unit state variou senior american polit leader have alreadi hint on sever occas of the possibl of militari sanction also the dprk continu refus to accept inspect have caus the un secur council to begin a full scale search for a solut to the problem thi will develop into a un resolut for forc inspect if even thi is refus militari action mai follow diplomat and econom sanction would thi then solv the dprk nuclear issu it is in no wai a simpl problem the threat of war due to a dprk retali against the rok cannot be preclud thi could result in the entir korean peninsula be pollut by nuclear radiat north south relat would enter their worst possibl state and the dream of peac coexist and unif we have so carefulli cultiv would retreat far into the background there can be no chang in our fundament posit desir that the dprk accept inspect howev it is not in our nation interest to go beyond what is need thi is becaus the iaea intern atom energi agenc is a mechan of inequ protect the superpow s nuclear monopoli sinc the collaps of the east west composit of the intern order nuclear southern namgukhwa attempt by non nuclear countri to obtain nuclear weapon is increas at thi time the iaea ha restor it author weaken by iraq and is build a strong system outlaw nuclear weapon there is no reason for us to step too far forward sinc the nuclear issu will undoubtedli progress along with the larger current of north south relat the relationship between the possess north and the non possess south be more concern about what we can do at the level of the korean peninsula such as reopen north south talk and negoti on mutual inspect would be more in our interest third an issu we will have to worri about in the futur is nuclear energi secur thi is becaus the rok nuclear energi industri is estim to have suffer consider damag with the govern s elucid of it abandon of enrich and reprocess facil apart from simpl econom consider the mainten of enrich and reprocess facil signifi much in relat to nuclear energi secur fourth the govern of the 6th republ adopt a linkag polici as it offici posit without progress on the nuclear issu we cannot proce with the issu of north south exchang thi is still accept as valid thi linkag polici ha behind it the at first glanc convinc argument north korea is stubbornli persist in it nuclear develop how can we offer econom cooper the problem is that thi argument is too uniform thu we need to appli a flexibl linkag polici first of all uniform linkag cannot guarante a dprk abandon of nuclear weapon the first reason for thi is that inspect is not a perfect mean of hinder nuclear develop with iaea inspect which ar hamper by mani obstacl to inspect site other than report facil and mutual inspect which investig onli agre upon site we cannot be 100 sure of a dprk abandon of nuclear weapon develop when through exchang we establish a structur of interdepend between north and south korea destroi the militari util of nuclear weapon we will have found a final solut to the nuclear problem uniform linkag block exchang therefor promot an immedi resolut of the nuclear issu mutual inspect but is actual an obstacl to reach a final solut to the problem we need to understand thi fact what must be made clear at thi point is that bring up as a reason for linkag cordial diplomaci toward alli such as the unit state and japan betrai simplist think unabl to understand the realism of intern polit the reason that becaus these alli maintain the posit that thei will not normal relat with the dprk without a resolut of the nuclear issu we must admit that thi is illog concern the nuclear issu the us and other nuclear power have exercis their influenc to prevent all non nuclear nation from gain nuclear capabl in order to maintain their nuclear monopoli of cours the reflect benefit gain by japan from a denuclear korean peninsula is great we must keep in mind that view from the perspect of the us and japan both of which want a non capabl korean peninsula our linkag polici must seem to be us sacrif our own long term interest stand at the forefront of the neutral of north and south korea nambukhan muryokhwa desir by surround nation fifth is the dilemma creat by japan emerg as an asymptomat nuclear nation mujunghu haekguk a nation possess nuclear weapon that while not expos militari aim actual ha militari potenti apart from it 42 nuclear power plant present under oper japan maintain the advanc nuclear facil on an enorm scale 15 research reactor two high speed

nuclear inspect and sai that it us it nuclear facil and nuclear materi for peac purpos when it advanc nuclear technolog is combin with exist mean of transport the world s most advanc electron materi electron industri aviat industri and space industri it could instantli creat a formid nuclear forc while develop it peac nuclear energi industri japan ultim obtain the byproduct of thi nuclear weapon potenti japan carri out brilliant nuclear diplomaci toward the unit state by retain enrich and reprocess facilit in exchang for it 1967 announc of it three non nuclear principl in comparison on cannot help but think we have lost much the nuclear polici of the 6th republ did not reflect our nation interest well and the problem face at that time still remain dilemma thi wa becaus it lack a deep understand of the realiti of the nuclear world which move accord to the principl of hegemoni and the zero sum rule and of the doubl valu of nuclear power for us to pursu an autonom nuclear polici therefor we must understand the econom valu of nuclear power us peacefulli as well as the realiti of the nuclear world on of the two valu of nuclear power is the polit and diplomat tool as well as the militari tool gain from possess nuclear weapon the other is the us of nuclear power to expand nation interest econom and technolog it ha been a long time sinc the fierc polit battl over nuclear power as a mean of bring at onc both nation secur and nation wealth ha becom normal between actor on the intern stage nation and terrorist group also thi battl gave birth to the nuclear non prolifer system it charact is repres by north south problem north north problem and south south problem that caus by the fierc competit and jealous between nuclear nation is the north north problem the lack of a secur guarante for non nuclear nation the distrust among non nuclear nation and so on ar call south south problem look at the north south problem of nuclear power in relat to the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula it essenc is the inequ between nuclear and non nuclear nation for exampl if we look at the pillar of the nuclear non prolifer system the nuclear non prolifer treati npt it ha three nomin object these ar to prevent the later prolifer of nuclear weapon to prevent the vertic prolifer of nuclear weapon and to encourag the peac us of nuclear power on closer inspect of the text howev on can quickli see that it is an unequ treati it permit vertic prolifer the continu develop and deploy of nuclear weapon by establish nuclear power while prohibit later prolifer the acquisit of nuclear weapon by non nuclear power result in their emerg as new nuclear nation compar to the time the treati went into effect the unit state and russia actual have come to possess more than three time the number of nuclear warhead thei have develop multi warhead missil cruis missil and other fearsom new weapon compar to thi despit the treati s call for the encourag of the us of peac nuclear power by non nuclear nation thi articl ha in fact been made a dead letter by the nuclear power although thi is also due to the dual natur of nuclear power which result in increas capabl for it divers to militari us as a peac nuclear industri develop thi is realli becaus the hobbesian instinct of the great power to maintain a monopoli on power ha domin the nuclear order thi inequ is even more obviou in the regul on nuclear inspect thei burden nuclear nation with no oblig whatsoev to accept nuclear inspect but make it obligatori that non nuclear member nation conclud a saftei meassur agreement with the iaea and open all their nuclear facil to intern inspect within 18 month thi unequ treati becam the textbook of todai s nuclear world with it 146 member nation becaus of the realiti of the power differ between the great power and smaller nation recent howev the inequ of the treati ha becom a point of content in intern nuclear polit as develop nation have gradual begun voic their opposit to it a heat north south debat is predict between nuclear nation and non nuclear nation demand a price dure the negoti on extend the npt it is difficult to set up a sound autonom nuclear polici without an understand of the econom valu of peac nuclear power the problemat point of the 6th republ s nuclear polici result from a lack of nation polici deliber concern thi the econom valu of nuclear power is central relat to enrich and reprocess facil first of all enrich is the kei to korean nuclear fuel of the nine nuclear reactor in us by the rok eight ar light water reactor us enrich uranium as fuel as long as we have no enrich facil we ar doom to import enrich uranium from foreign countri in the case of the rok the fuel fabric process is now done domest but possess no enrich facil it is miss on import element for korean nuclear fuel becaus it is a central part of the fuel cycl without the enrich process we cannot achiev the korean of the nuclear fuel cycl nor can we achiev nuclear energi secur possess eight light water reactor and have alreadi establish their economi we must no longer put off secur enrich facil thi is even more the case given the energi secur natur of the problem also just as with enrich facil as long as we have no reprocess facil it will be imposs to make our nuclear industri truli advanc the gain brought by reprocess ar as follow first reprocess produc sever hundr varieti of isotop includ transuranium isotop possibl to produc onli by reprocess us for a varieti of purpos medic agricultur industri measur instrument chemic compound synthesi and so on second some uranium remain in the nuclear fuel after us thi is also a valuabl resourc third through reprocess a valuabl resourc for nuclear energi plutonium is extract from spent nuclear if the rok onli had reprocess facil it could extract 2 4 ton of plutonium everi year from 240 ton of us nuclear fuel plutonium is us as fuel for high speed breeder reactor an almost magic nuclear reactor us plutonium as a fuel to creat new plutonium the high speed breeder reactor make possibl an epoch make recycl of resourc extend the us of uranium over 60 time lastli reprocess itself

in japan it support the inform societi keep industri stabl and guarante a comfort wai of life thi concept of energi secur is also the basi of japan s govern polici on atom energi and it is essenti for chang the weak natur of energi so that energi can be ensur into the futur japan ha been involv with nuclear power sinc the atom energi act wa institut in januari 1956 11 year after the war that law is base on the polici that atom energi is to be limit to peac us premis on the guarante of safeti manag democrat and that it result ar to be made public it wa also a decis made by japan on of the world s most nuclear allerg countri japan s atom energi develop start with enrich uranium and then burn it as fuel in boil water reactor bwr pressur water reactor pwr or high temperatur ga reactor later while us the plutonium made in those reactor japan went on to convert deplet uranium u 239 which wa not us befor into plutonium and us it in fast breeder reactor from which the amount of energi produc plutonium is more than the amount consum plutonium furthermor japan is follow the road to nuclear fusion reactor atom energi util plan that involv the us of plutonium in particular form the basi of the govern s atom energi polici and that sort of plan ha been emphas sinc the begin of japan s atom energi develop the reason for the promot of that govern polici is first and foremost the effect us of resourc 1 the uranium resourc that becom nuclear reactor fuel ar presum to be in reserv of about the same amount as petroleum reserv and ar limit in anoth hundr year or so when the econom offset uranium can no longer be mine that amount is estim to be two and four million ton thi uranium is not just for us by japan and the other wealthi countri whose atom energi develop is advanc with the rate of econom develop in develop countri we can see how after a while countri will no longer be abl to us uranium freeli 2 us plutonium can be 10 or more time effici than us uranium trial calcul show that the approxim 70 year worth of uranium reserv can be expand to 3 600 year worth that is the big reason for us plutonium the result of develop in plutonium util ar bear fruit in the 31st year next april the monju reactor which us plutonium for fuel to gener electr is to reach critic with that the develop of reactor that us plutonium will be all the more definit that is also the wai to skip ahead to the forefront of atom energi develop given the wane interest in such develop with the new clinton administr in the us thi us of plutonium is not someth that the world welcom as the plutonium transport ship the akatsuki maru experienc thi januari there ar also highli vocal misgiv about plutonium us that link to nuclear weapon to clear awai such doubt japan ha alreadi made clear it posit on the need for plutonium fuel base reactor develop japan is also activ work to make sure that the develop is limit to peac us and is transpar enough to be understood in electr power gener by mean of light water and other such reactor plutonium produc within the fuel rod provid on third of the electr power gener when a light water reactor oper plutonium is turn natur into energi for electr power and that amount reach up to on tenth of the total amount of electr power produc by thermoelectr hydroelectr and other power plant us plutonium serious involv even more activ util of the plutonium produc within nuclear reactor the wai to do that is to remov plutonium in a state in which it is mix with uranium from spent fuel then to burn it in a special kind of reactor a fast breeder reactor fbr and also to us the plutonium in combin with bwr and pwr fuel with the fuel for nuclear reactor center on light water reactor onli a mere 1 of the burnabl uranium uranium 235 contain in the uranium or can be util the remain 99 is unburn uranium uranium 239 that is discard the us of plutonium ha two aspect convert that unburn uranium into plutonium with a special reactor like the monju and then activ us that plutonium and us the plutonium produc in the fuel rod of light water reactor establish the technolog for that will lead to achiev the goal of expand uranium usag by 10 or more time and japan s creation of a new man made energi the first stage in the seriou us of plutonium is the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corp s monju fbr that reactor whose technolog is base on the 100 000 kw joyo experiment reactor that reach critic in 1977 is japan s first fbr for electr power gener construct of the monju reactor which will have an electr output of 280 000 kw start in octob 1985 in 1991 equip instal wa complet and comprehens test conclud and on 13 octob the initi fuel load wa carri out critic is expect to happen in april 1994 furthermor there is also a demonstr reactor

electr output of 1 million kw and the cost of it construct will be 1 5 time that of a light water reactor the construct of thi demonstr reactor is seen as a project with a definit time period even in the long term atom energi develop and util plan that is be written thi year the plutonium util rout will becom certain in addit the privat sector start the construct of a reprocess plant that will be the decid factor of the nuclear fuel cycl the reprocess plant will suppli plutonium fuel to the fbr that ar under develop ground prepar ar now be made for the reprocess plant which will be in the rokkasho reprocess plant that the japan nuclear fuel co is build in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur the reprocess plant is to start oper in 2000 and will have the capac to reprocess the spent nuclear fuel from about 30 1 million kw power plant 800 ton per year the plan is for the plant to produc about 50 ton of plutonium by 2010 the plant will us a wet method the purex method to dissolv spent fuel in nitric acid and then separ the uranium plutonium and fission product in order to prevent the plutonium from be convert into nuclear weapon the plutonium and uranium will be in an oxid state and will be remov just as thei ar mix in a on to on ratio the reprocess plant will be a plant that take nuclear nonprolifer into consider at the same time to answer ani doubt extra care will be taken to guarante the control of nuclear substanc and the emphasi will be on a manag system in which there will be no extract of plutonium from the product process and no plutonium with an unknown destin the

reason is that the direct inject system with it high volumetr effici for air oper leaner than the premix system under an ident load we therefor feel that the declin in heat effici due to rich becom a

thought to result from a reduct in the volumetr effici of air sinc there is no declin in the volumetr effici of air at 1 in a direct inject system we felt that a rich mixtur benefit thermal dissoci

net profit in the come year the situat of our mine activ is better than befor but it is still far from satisfactori as for the reprocess branch activ will increas in the come year and thi should be reflect in the result cogema advantag is that it market doe not depend much on the current econom climat howev the poor growth in electr consumpt is slow the construct of new plant which will make our sale more difficult in the long term in a market with slow growth rochard cogema is activ in plutonium recycl ar you not expect a halt to be put to thi under pressur from the unit state which doe not have a civilian plutonium industri and with the excus of combat prolifer japan ha recent frozen it reprocess program in thi wai syrota i do not agre with your analysi let us look at the most recent event in great britain the thorp reprocess plant ha just been put into servic despit protest and action taken in court by antinuclear activist if there wa intervent it wa not effect i prefer to think that there wa not ani anoth exampl can be found in belgium thi is a veri interest case becaus belgium s percentag of electr of nuclear origin is veri high almost as high as in franc in addit belgium wa the first countri in the world to manufactur mox fuel a fuel in which plutonium replac enrich uranium as the fissil materi for more than 20 year the fuel ha been produc under condit which ar satisfactori from all point of view as we recent began reprocess their us fuel in our up3 plant in la hagu belgian electr industri ask their govern for author to load their reactor with mox fuel by recycl their plutonium the govern said ye provid that parliament approv it so an in depth debat wa held in which the issu of reprocess and nuclear energi in gener were rais the belgian parliament vote by a veri larg major in favor of us mox as well as in favor of pursu reprocess contract there too reason won the dai as for japan it ha not frozen it reprocess program at all so what ha happen everi five year japan review it long term energi program it then make adjust base on the most recent econom situat and new prospect the fast breeder reactor to follow in the footstep of monju will be built but later than plan with a delai of some 10 year howev it is interest to point out that the monju fast breeder reactor which is the same size as phenix is current be start up the japanes ar develop fast breeder reactor technolog becaus thei think that thei will be of interest in come decad and plai an import role in the futur electronuclear sector similarli thei have begun construct of the rokkashomura reprocess plant which is compar to the up3 plant in la hagu with a capac of 800 tonn per year compar to us the japanes ar lag behind in thi domain but thei ar catch up and it seem to me that their ambit in the nuclear sector ar still just as strong rochard so in your opinion japan is not call it nuclear program into question and while it mai be slow down it is onli do so to adapt to demand syrota exactli i can confirm thi for you follow a two week trip i made to japan a month ago dure which i met not onli electr industrialist but also mr eda the minist in charg of nuclear power rochard do you think that china will begin build new nuclear plant syrota i do not see how china can do without them china s economi is grow rapidli at more than 10 percent per year todai it main sourc of energi is low grade coal us under poor condit with a per capita incom that is still low china is alreadi on of the biggest emitt of carbon dioxid in the world i heard the reknown scientist georg charpak nobel prize winner explain on televis that the chines would have to give prioriti to develop their nuclear industri rochard the plutonium industri in itself bear the risk of nuclear arm prolifer do you not think that thi risk is greater than the advantag link to reprocess syrota sure not atom bomb can be made without plutonium rememb hiroshima so how ar prolifer problem shape up there is current a lot of talk about north korea befor that it wa iraq pakistan india south africa israel and a few other how did these countri try to get or how did thei get the bomb in two wai some tri to produc militari qualiti uranium while other tri to produc militari qualiti plutonium in the first instanc it wa via an illeg uranium enrich facil that is what the iraqi and south african did undoubtedli with the help of foreign technolog plutonium base prolifer requir under irradi fuel which must be discreetli remov from a nuclear reactor and the plutonium must be separ from it in a secret reprocess facil thi is the import point the onli wai to make militari qualiti plutonium i e virtual pure fissil plutonium is to have under irradi fuel avail if the fuel remain in the reactor for a long time secondari reaction take place and the plutonium contain an ever increas proport of non fissil isotop it then becom unsuit for us in bomb electr compani ar try to obtain the greatest amount of electr possibl with their fuel for obviou econom reason even though the plutonium separ from these us fuel contain a lot of nonfissil plutonium moreov electronuclear fuel reprocess oper ar under intern control and thei do not lie at the origin of ani exampl of known prolifer rochard the nonprolifer treati is to be renegoti in 1995 what can be done to ensur that it is effect syrota we must not miss the target the problem to be solv is the control of illeg activ experi ha shown that the intern atom energi agenc doe not have problem control countri like franc japan or great britain but doe have problem try to see what it want in more suspect countri i would reiter that north korea and iraq sign the npt nuclear nonprolifer treati we must do what is necessari so that the agenc can better control the reactor most like to easili produc under irradi fuel better detect illeg program and better supervis transfer of sensit technolog to thi can be ad a new problem that of supervis militari qualiti uranium and plutonium from the upcom dismantl of american and russian weapon on wai of resolv thi is to us thi plutonium and uranium to produc electr highli enrich uranium just need to be dilut to make it into nuclear fuel as for plutonium it can be us to make mox fuel becaus wherea electronuclear plutonium is not suitabl for make bomb militari qualiti plutonium can convers be us for electr gener and that is the most ecolog wai of destroi it unfortun the american who ar the first to be interest do not have the appropri industri solut rochard ar you pleas with the decis to restart superphenix as a research reactor although thi reactor wa initi design to make nuclear fuel come full circl and burn plutonium syrota fast breeder reactor can be justifi by the fact that as thei us plutonium thei make even more of it by transform at the same time non fissil uranium 238 into fissil plutonium 239 so thi is on wai of us natur uranium complet the fast breeder reactor produc 40 to 50 time as much energi with the same quantiti of uranium as a light water reactor superphenix wa design with a view to an upcom shortag of uranium and wa made to run optim on thi basi i am convinc that there will not be a shortag of uranium for a veri long time howev thi doe not mean that there is no interest in fast neutron reactor for the futur becaus fast neutron reactor have anoth advantag thei ar capabl of destroi atom in the plutonium famili actinid and thei destroi plutonium s nonfissil isotop much better than light water reactor thi is on of the reason why it is us to put the superphenix back into servic rochard doe superphenix still constitut a major loss syrota it requir a veri heavi invest which like ani other prototyp will not becom profit as such sinc the invest wa made the choic wa either to put a halt to the program and lose everyth or to do what wa decid rochard after the cadarach accid brice lalond denounc the inadequ safeti demand especi as regard those site which ar begin to ag badli is there realli a problem syrota extrem rigor examin ar carri out to inspect the ag of facil the nuclear industri experi the same problem as ani other activ be it chemic steelmak oil product etc howev our industri is subject to far more meticul supervis by the author nuclear oper undertak a vast number of check and spend a lot of monei to maintain their facil and replac part that need replac that is why in my opinion nuclear power should be reserv for those countri which know how to manag advanc technolog and who have the financi resourc to do so as far as develop countri ar concern we mai well fear that thei will skimp on mainten and safeti requir we must not build nuclear plant just anywher in the world rochard doe china meet these requir syrota china need nuclear resourc so much that it will have to meet these requir with the growth rate of it economi it should have the necessari resourc and not succumb to the temptat to make the save which i fear rochard given the state of the nuclear sector in eastern europ the world is still sit on a powder keg where do we realli stand syrota the main risk is chernobyl type plant in gener and chernobyl in particular thei can be shut down to do thi there is a solut which is technic simpl to save energi energi consumpt in the countri of eastern europ is so high becaus energi is virtual free there if energi were bill at it true price consumpt would drop and there would no longer be ani need for danger plant rochard what is the impact of the freez on nuclear test for cogema syrota cogema make materi for militari us but the trial themselv have veri littl impact on our order book we no longer have ani order for militari plutonium which wa produc in marcoul and order for militari uranium ar also go to stop but we do not know when thi is what worri our employe in pierrelatt but in ani case the plant will not shut down befor the end of 1995 and it would not be until the second half of 1996 that employ problem would crop up rochard sinc you becam the head of cogema in 1988 you have said that you would like to see more capit particip you were talk more about financi establish sinc then total ha becom your sharehold ar you look for other partner is the bank insur profil still up to date syrota my answer to both those question is ye there ar sever type of potenti partner for cogema financi investor interest in the long term regular profit of our busi industrialist with whom we can develop synergi in our area of activ which is the case with total and lastli commerci partner here we have electr produc especi those who do not have a nuclear fuel industri in their countri i definit hope that someth will happen in the next few month but we cannot sai anyth until the agreement have been sign and all the go ahead have been given

FBIS4-20567: cso articl by a kishi mazda technic research center yokohama text 1 introduct as the econom recess continu a social re examin seem to be take place with regard to give consum the kind of product and servic that thei realli want i believ that in time such as thi there is more of a demand for authent product and technolog what i mean here by authent is provid a basic valu for good purchas that give the averag custom a sens of satisfact to meet these need requir matur technolog that show an understand of the consum and what thei want the matur technolog refer to here ar consum technolog that essenti solv the problem that peopl consid import to them for that reason i think that we ar enter a time in which research institut that have stockpil mani differ technolog will be ask to lead the wai therefor in thi paper i would like to introduc the mazda technic research center and in do so discuss what it is do to address these new social trend 2 research center profil the first technic research center that mazda establish to concentr on new technolog wa in 1985 at it headquart in hiroshima and then in 1987 it ad the yokohama technic research center in yokohama the basic idea behind open the technic research center here in yokohama wa to us the slogan at the time build an automobil cultur what thi mean is not treat the car simpli as a mean of travel but treat it as on of the essenti element of societi and cultur that peopl need when the research center initi receiv word of thi new slogan the research center at mazda headquart in hiroshima decid to put it emphasi on new technolog that were directli relat to the develop of car type wherea the research center in yokohama decid it would focu on basic technolog in advanc field orient toward automobil technolog of the 21st centuri at present the two research center ar exchang idea and deepen ti with on anoth base on respect area of expertis and ar steadili plai more import role as the core place within mazda for develop new technolog next befor we get into specif research activ i would like to discuss my own view regard research 3 person view regard research research institut ar at the pinnacl of research and develop and have an import mission in develop and explor consum technolog for that reason i feel that research institut have to reflect the long term and medium term need of consum in their research with that in mind i would like to take the opportun here to state the direct i believ that consum trend ar go until now compani have stress high valu ad car that offer more in the wai of divers perform and function in the futur howev there will probabl be a shift from superfici enjoy need to more basic enjoy need the need for exampl to maintain respect for human life whether on s own or other is grow ever more stronger in term of both product safeti and the environ for exampl someth ha to be done about the more than 10 000 peopl a year that die in auto accid and the other problem that exist such as environment pollut caus by carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid and also find other energi altern to petroleum these problem ar an immedi and futur threat to ourselv our famili and our children and ar caus for concern these ar essenti problem that have to do with the car itself so if we ar to resolv these issu we must steadili stockpil those technolog with an ey toward the futur with that said i would now like to introduc some area of research to show the work we ar do in tackl some of these problem 4 research activ outlin in thi section i have divid the research activ into environ friendli and peopl friendli research and focus in on particular research project in each area from the perspect discuss abov of address the basic need of todai s consum 4 1 environ friendli technolog what we mean here by environ friendli technolog ar those technolog for solv the environment and energi resourc problem we ar like to face in the 21st centuri more specif it mean those technolog concern with develop energi altern to petroleum and those technolog concern with recycl that try to limit exhaust ga emiss by research new combust method for reduc carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid emiss and make effect us of resourc 1 technolog for develop energi substitut i would like to start by talk about the hydrogen rotari engin automobil hr x thi car wa develop to convei the imag of an urban type commut car to be us in a 21st centuri environ restor with light and greeneri figur 1 figur not reproduc is a photograph of the hr x car a hydrogen rotari engin is a clean engin that burn hydrogen and is revolutionari in the sens that it doe not emit carbon dioxid nor destroi natur cycl more recent we develop a prototyp model of that car outfit with a hydrogen fuel cell and successfulli test drove it for the first time figur 2 figur not reproduc is a photograph of the hydrogen fuel cell car thi car enabl us to clarifi a number of technic issu have to do with outfit a car such as thi and took us on step closer toward achiev the goal of a futur societi base on hydrogen fuel car 2 technolog for control exhaust ga emiss in term of research on engin we ar research the composit of fuel mixtur and combust mechan us a varieti of method includ both visual and comput base in try to chang the flame propag process we have been do research on a peripher combust process that caus the spark ignit to occur from the peripheri of the cylind us thi techniqu we were abl to reduc nitrou oxid emiss dramat and bring about a major improv in lean burn combust that research receiv the asahara academ achiev award at the 42nd japan societi of automot engin confer 3 recycl technolog we ar also do research on materi in term of recycl which includ both metal and plastic and in so do have develop a recycl plastic composit made of a plastic fiber reinforc liquid crystal polym we now have the abil to recycl plastic composit that were onc virtual imposs to recycl and ar abl to make more effect us of our resourc 4 2 peopl friendli technolog what we mean here by peopl friendli technolog ar those technolog concern with understand the need of the driver and passeng and those concern with improv safeti in order to make the automobil societi we live in more enjoy and troubl free 1 prevent safeti we ar involv in a number of research project on advanc technolog concern with prevent accid on of these involv a safe drive support system and anoth a road traffic commun system the safe drive support system is a system that act as a back up in case of driver error and the commun system is a system for provid driver with safeti inform about the road for exampl in the safe drive support system project we ar do research on automat brake and a white line recognit method in figur 3 figur not reproduc we show the test car we ar us in our research on white line recognit by imag process mount in the trunk of the car is a high speed comput program to recogn road featur 2 human technolog we ar also make headwai in research on a driver simul in order to elucid the drive psycholog and behavior characterist of driver in figur 4 we show a gener draw of the drive simul with a driver on board the drive simul is expect to be us as a tool for elucid caus of auto accid and also as a tool for research drive characterist of beginn and older driver figur 4 gener draw of drive simul we have also been do research on wai to evalu driver alert by measur brain wave so that we can take those habit into account when design the insid of the car so as to make it harder for the driver to fall asleep figur 5 figur not reproduc show an experi be conduct to ascertain the relationship between brain wave signal and delai respons in human due to decreas alert person be test in photograph is author of articl there ar a lot of central function in the human brain that remain unknown i think that by creat an understand of driver characterist such as recognit alert and fatigu by studi brain activ that we can offer new consum technolog for improv safeti 5 conclus in the forego we profil the entir research center and discuss some individu research project i think that the kei to provid consum with what thei want in term of basic valu ar the technolog that we have been busi stockpil in introduc the research center from thi perspect we want to thank the mani technic engin and research special in automobil technolog for their help in shed some light on the research project be carri out within the center

the util compani and the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corp pnc regard the futur develop of fast breeder reactor fbr we ar publish in thi edit an extract of a portion of an articl futur fbr topic fbr and plutonium util technolog by yoshiro takahashi deputi chairman of the pnc develop promot headquart thi articl wa taken from the proceed of the report and lectur meet which wa carri out last month by the pnc pnc ha complet the prototyp reactor monju util independ technolog from the begin of the develop of thi fbr the appeal of fbr first from the standpoint of effect util of uranium resourc fbr possess superior characterist when compar to other type of reactor chart no 1 below show an exampl of when plutonium fuel recycl is us an apprais of the relationship between the percentag composit of plutonium isotop as shown on the y axi and the number of time the plutonium fuel is recycl as shown on the x axi for both light water reactor lwr and fbr compar to lwr when recycl is done in an fbr even if the number of recycl is increas the percentag of isotop which can caus fission in other word the amount of fissil plutonium doe not decreas significantli in other word if recycl is done in an fbr it is possibl to carri out the recycl countless time and the problem of plutonium ag doe not exist chart no 1 chang in the composit of pu isotop anoth appeal of fbr is that element such as minor actinid which were hitherto consid wast materi can be us as fuel in thi type of reactor and therefor the burden place on the back end can be reduc therefor through burn the plutonium produc at lwr and fbr thi weak point of nuclear power util can be effect util as a valuabl resourc final becaus of fbr superior rate of thermal effici wast heat can be reduc to the utmost thi is an outstand characterist from the point of view of environment protect scenario for bring fbr into actual us up until now nuclear power util ha develop reli on lwr in order to util fbr it is necessari to bring into harmoni and unifi lwr recycl technolog and fbr recycl technolog when econom assess ar discuss it is not fit that just fbr ar talk about rather the debat should includ the evalu of lwr fbr and recycl technolog in gener we will show that the best scenario is for us to move as quickli as possibl to discard the system us mainli lwr and gradual move toward system which reli on fbr chart no 2 below show the relationship between total free world uranium demand and resourc volum through around the year 2030 at which time the total demand will approach the total amount of resourc suppli becaus the percentag of facil cost as a part of the total construct cost is high if nuclear power plant ar not us for their entir durabl life span thei ar not econom in fact becaus fuel suppli ar secur by long term contract which last for 20 year if you consid the amount of uranium secur by contract in 2030 the amount of uranium requir will clearli exce the total demand amount shown below therefor it is possibl that there could be a failur of the uranium suppli balanc befor 2030 chart no 2 free world uranium demand on the other hand if new uranium resourc ar discov the urgenc of thi trend will be reliev there ar those who take the optimist view of thi situat sai if the uranium suppli balanc break down then the develop of new uranium mine will proce therefor for the time be there is no urgenc with regard to uranium resourc thi attitud of do noth while simpli wait for such good fortun is noth more than underestim the urgenc of the uranium suppli situat no on can guarante the discoveri of new larg scale uranium reserv to prepar for the urgent uranium suppli situat it is exceedingli import to prepar the technolog system requir to make possibl the util of fbr plutonium recycl by about 2030 as long as uranium is us in lwr it is inevit that plutonium will be produc as state abov it is fbr that can make us of thi plutonium and effect util uranium resourc next i will explain why it is so import to introduc fbr as quickli as possibl the follow is an exampl of analysi show just how much fbr can contribut to the power suppli assum the plutonium recycl technolog system is prepar and fbr ar introduc into the system start in 2030 chart no 3 below show the result of analysi base on the supposit of the high case as shown abov wherein japan s nuclear power plant capac at the end of 2030 top 100 million kilowatt and where the rate of growth experienc between 2010 and 2030 continu after 2030 thi analysi wa base on the follow supposit an annual amount of reprocess spent fuel from lwr base on uranium mass convers of 1 600 ton a life span for lwr and fbr of 40 year an fbr breed ratio of 1 2 and an out of reactor fuel cycl durat of three year chart no 3 estim of nuclear power plant even in a case where fbr ar introduc all of the spent fuel from lwr and fbr is rapidli reprocess and all of the plutonium recov is util after 2030 even if fbr ar introduc to their greatest possibl extent fbr alon will not be abl to keep pace with anticip demand and therefor it will be necessari to build new lwr introduct of new lwr now mean that there will be no surplu of plutonium after 2030 in other word thi show that until around 2070 there will be inadequ suppli of plutonium to meet grow demand plutonium for the fbr which will replac the lwr that have pass their life span nobodi is argu the fact that we will need fbr in the futur but we still reli on lwr todai if we stop turn the spent fuel from these lwr into wast and instead recycl that fuel it can becom a stabl energi suppli for the futur the plutonium balanc is current be debat there ar mani peopl who ar of the opinion that becaus of econom consider the bring into actual us of fbr should be push back later and later it can be said howev that the best wai to bring thi reactor technolog into actual us is to build the reactor while make improv after improv and while consid the pursuit of econom characterist steadili develop a demonstr reactor and then a commerci reactor while maintain the plutonium balanc base on thi analysi of an fbr introduct scenario at an earli period of fbr commerci it is necessari to increas the breed ratio and decreas the time of the out of reactor cycl in order not to overus fbr at the begin of cours if abund suppli of uranium resourc were avail then it would be possibl to consid a more relax introduct scenario howev base on the develop effort it is import to util plutonium in fbr at an earli date furthermor when the fbr have reach matur it is import to adjust their breed ratio and when mankind chang over to anoth energi sourc to remov plutonium from the face of the earth in other word it is necessari to elimin all of the plutonium the develop of technolog which will make these thing feasibl is an oblig which ha been place upon the develop of todai with that let s undertak thi new duti in cooper with countri such as the unit state and franc the statu of monju regard the current statu of fbr develop our countri ha complet the reactor monju and we ar at the stage where we can pursu the implement and econom viabil of a plant system that can extract heat as energi current at monju prepar ar move steadili forward in prepar for the first critic of the reactor which is schedul for april of next year after that test will take place on the reactor physic the nuclear superheat and output test if thing go smoothli the plant is plan to enter regular oper in the end of 1995 prospect for commerci japan s demonstr reactor have enter into a stage where thei can be steadili improv base on monju in order for fbr to come into actual us across the board improv need to be plan in area such as reactor safeti and reliabl along with reactor economi furthermor it is also necessari to increas the level of accept for these reactor within societi befor the time of their commerci around 2030 in order to do thi it is necessari to steadili

FBIS4-20664: term plan revis interview fbr commerci nuclear fuel recycl 94fe0274a tokyo enerugi foramu in japanes oct 93 pp 71 76 94fe0274a tokyo enerugi foramu japanes cso interview by tetsuya ishikawa enerugi foramu with sadahiko washimi vp kansai electr power compani and atsuyuki suzuki professor faculti of engin univers of tokyo text most signific cours of nuclear fuel recycl ef let s begin with mr suzuki we sincer appreci your work on the nuclear fuel recycl expert subcommitte report issu on 10 juli 1991 sinc then the intern trend toward non prolifer ha becom more dynam with the problem over what to do with the plutonium from dismantl nuclear weapon in the former soviet union the transport of plutonium from franc to japan by the akatsuki maru and so forth what do you think suzuki two year have pass sinc we issu the nuclear fuel recycl report and dure that time mani factor for chang have arisen on kei point in that report is the fact that it show in number the cost of plutonium suppli and demand over the next 20 year or so anoth point is that the report emphas we should reveal beforehand both at home and abroad japan s plan for plutonium util and in the spirit of open proce with those plan these two issu will be import from now on as well i think we should carefulli reconsid the quantit balanc of suppli and demand in the hear to revis the nuclear energi long term plan moreov as far as open is concern i think it will be increasingli import for japan to be as up front as possibl about her plan for peac util of nuclear energi when we consid the rapid shift toward nuclear disarma accompani the fall of the soviet union the problem with north korea and so forth i sincer hope the long term plan subcommitte will consid thi carefulli and if thei do then the kei issu will be what will happen to japan s fbr commerci plan ef it appear that the plan for fbr commerci is attach by it umbil cord to the hear on the long term plan that mean that fbr commerci and plutonium util ar realli two side of the same coin thi relationship becam crystal clear when the continu sinter furnac that make fuel pellet for the prototyp reactor monju broke down and delai critic for the third time some peopl on the basic subpanel which ha the job of overse the expert subcommitte work on the long term plan have said that we must decid whether to give prioriti to the balanc of plutonium suppli and demand or to cost effect suzuki both cost effect and balanc plutonium suppli and demand ar import but in discuss up till now consist in govern polici ha been consid more import than cost effect becaus of the posit of the atom energi commiss of japan so it seem to me that the discuss over plutonium suppli and demand ha receiv more attent from an intern standpoint howev if we try to go ahead with a specif plan in the futur then it is import to consid how much it will cost in that sens mani peopl ar now discuss how we should handl the issu of cost effect at least that is my understand everyon associ with nuclear power in japan believ that plutonium will sure becom an import sourc of energi in the long run but if we accept the premis that plutonium is absolut necessari then we also have to sai that it doe not matter how much it will cost howev in order to master the us of plutonium for the futur we must make the oper both streamlin and cost effect and an extrem import point will be how much we can increas thi cost effect streamlin from now on mox process will cost more than uranium process but if we sai it is better just becaus it cost more that is not the true reason actual there ar two advantag we can cut down on uranium usag if we recycl plutonium in lwr and uranium enrich will no longer be necessari furthermor if we make plutonium mix fuel of cours we have to pai the process cost but in ani event we should be abl to find a happi medium i think we should make thi a goal for technolog develop in other word i think it is veri import that we should attach great import to the govern s approach that we not possess excess plutonium and at the same time we should also pursu cost effect streamlin of the oper ef mr washimi what is the posit of those in the electr power industri washimi from a secur standpoint i think we should clearli adopt the concept of plutonium balanc as nation polici and move in the direct of not possess excess plutonium i think the basic path to achiev thi is to adopt mox fuel and us plutonium in fbr my reason is that we cannot acquir energi for the 21st centuri if we do not util plutonium but when we consid cost effect as well we cannot simpli sai that pursu a balanc in suppli and demand should be our polici no matter how much it cost the electr power industri collect a fee from everyon who us electr and on basi for make decis is how much of that fee can be appli to the cost of prepar futur energi suppli on the other hand technolog develop take a veri long time to bear fruit when we look at the histori of lwr develop it ha taken about 30 year we have been told that even if we begin develop for fbr commerci todai it will be 2030 befor the ag of the fbr truli arriv all the peopl who ar aliv until that time will be custom of the electr power industri and it is up to us to find out how much of their electr bill thei will allow us to us to pai for technolog develop from that standpoint the electr power industri cannot boldli promot fbr commerci without the consent of the populac therefor i believ the electr power industri should not act on it own but should discuss the matter with scholar and the govern then in some form or other we should draw a line to indic how much capit we think we ought to invest in the futur and strive to work within that rang ef mr suzuki the idea that plutonium util and fbr will be expens that ha been embrac by democrat parti non prolifer hardlin in the us congress and mr leventh the anti plutonium activist ha attain wide accept most american nuclear weapon have plutonium warhead and american belief ar strongli root in a societi where peac and militari us of nuclear energi have been mix togeth suzuki when plutonium is not recycl it is commonli call on through in the case of on through we cannot determin the final stop point in other word can we or should we get rid of all our spent fuel no countri ha tri thi yet even in discuss in the us comparison ar made without clarifi thi issu and so in the true sens of the word comparison of cost effect ar not possibl what is import in explan why recycl is reason is whether spent fuel is consid a us resourc or not i believ it is a us resourc so for me the problem is when and how much of it will be recycl as a resourc rather than simpli a problem of cost effect i think thi is a nearli insolv problem if we do not consid how we will obtain a stabl long term suppli of the resourc in the past the rule ha been that spent fuel will be recycl as a resourc as soon as possibl but there is realli no need to hurri i think it is import to us the right amount of spent fuel at the right time as a resourc and definit not dispos of it as wast ef but japan doe not have a lot of land washimi japan is a small countri but nuclear fuel itself is veri compact and we ar still debat whether we should dispos of spent fuel entir or keep it for process either wai if we can obtain the consensu of the major of the populac it will not take up a lot of space on the other hand by the second half of the 21st centuri we will begin to reach the end of our buri reserv of oil and natur ga and their price will gradual rise even if the fbr were develop right awai although it would be more expens than gener electr from oil burn plant right now as power produc we must give the highest prioriti to the issu of which path will place the smallest burden on our custom in the futur when price of lng and oil have gone up i believ that we can acquir adequ cost effect at that time by improv and develop our present fbr technolog weather the mass media storm ef as a former newspap report i wa disappoint in the report of the transport of plutonium by the akatsuki maru it took more than six year to complet the u s japan atom energi agreement that place the two countri on an equal foot at that time near the end of the negoti the us wa insist on transport by air but japan resist howev the state of alaska and other protest becaus anchorag airport would lie along the cours so the murkowski amend wa pass by congress to revers the us posit if the newspap report had bother to learn the histori behind plutonium transport thei would not have report the event in that wai washimi it is necessari to util plutonium in order to guarante a futur sourc of nuclear fuel for power gener in accord with thi basic plan we had the reprocess done oversea recov the plutonium and brought it back on the akatsuki maru i consid thi on step we have taken toward the futur at that time we were oppos by greenpeac but i think that perhap we did not strive hard enough to seek their understand about plutonium in addit we could not reveal absolut everi bit of inform to the public becaus of the need to protect nuclear materi it is human natur that the more thing we keep hidden the more peopl want to know about them my understand is that the govern is review issu such as how to form mutual agreement and how much inform can be releas to the public these ar certainli issu that must be consid therefor we must hold firm to our basic plan for convert unburn uranium 238 which account for 99 3 percent of all the uranium into plutonium 239 and us it suzuki what mr washimi said just now illustr a good lesson from the standpoint of protect nuclear materi in other word from the standpoint of secur it is onli natur that some inform is difficult to disclos to the public the govern ha follow the approach that it ha respons to the us and to europ so inform disclos to the public should be kept to an absolut minimum howev mani ordinari citizen doubt whether that is the real issu or not inform concern safeti is not for secur but for safeti and thei think that as much inform as possibl concern safeti should be avail to the public on the other hand inform that is absolut necessari for secur cannot be disclos to the public in realiti it is difficult to know where to draw the line through what we have just experienc we have learn that mani peopl in japan think non disclosur should be kept to a bare minimum and mani peopl in place like franc seem to feel the same wai we have learn anoth import lesson as well we japanes tend to take for grant that becaus we ar clearli limit the us of plutonium to peac purpos and ar not even consid militari us peopl in other countri will natur go along with our plan our experi ha made us realiz onc more that that is not the case on more point is that becaus we japanes tend to think about plutonium and atom energi pure in term of peac util we have becom somewhat insensit to the us of atom energi in other countri japanes newspap and other media have paid littl attent to the north korean problem the foreign ministri ha had sever contact through formal diplomat channel and that is what we expect but newspap and public opinion poll show almost no interest i am sure that american find thi hard to believ thei cannot understand how the japanes can be so nonchal about a neighbor countri want to go nuclear i am hope that thi flap about the akatsuki maru will be an opportun for japanes peopl to gain some understand of the work of intern peac ef i watch a special program broadcast on nhk on 23 mai entitl japan the plutonium superpow ii the dream and realiti of nuclear fuel recycl i felt it wa so bias that i sent a letter with sever question to their offic of inquiri thei pass my letter on to the head of the report divis but the respons i got back did not answer my question suzuki report talk to me too but it appear that the report had just come to me for inform and i did not appear on the program at all when the report talk to me thei made it clear what the program intend to sai so i wa not too surpris but when a report organ tackl the plutonium problem i guess we can expect them to be rather critic in mani instanc thei did not acknowledg the fact and i wish thei were a littl more enlighten regardless of their approach howev i am happi that thei spent two even of prime time to look at plutonium it mai not have been directli effect in open peopl s ey but a report from an unrel magazin publish visit me after watch the program and ask me if what he saw on the program wa true after i explain thing to him he wrote an articl expound the true fact of the situat so there ha been that kind of secondari effect i like to look at it in a posit light ef i watch it togeth with my wife and after it wa over my wife said to me why don t you stop work your finger to the bone the futur is so bleak and develop the fbr will be a total wast washimi i agre with mr suzuki that it wa good for them to report on the plutonium issu at least after the first part of the nhk special that is how we felt but the second part wa just too on side for exampl the program state that there ar 5 million ton of uranium resourc so the fbr is total unnecessari right now the amount of offici confirm unmin uranium is 2 1 million ton and even if we includ all the most probabl addit estim resourc it onli come to 3 4 million ton the onli wai to get 5 million ton is to add in everi specul about uranium deposit that have not been confirm and mai or mai not exist we still do not know whether thei ar there or not not onli that the figur thei us togeth with the 5 million ton ar base on the premis that the price of uranium will go up to 100 lb right now it is onli 10 lb so i do not think their calcul ar realist thei should show more clearli how thei arriv at those number look at anoth exampl the program report that reprocess will produc a sixfold increas in nuclear wast actual that is true right now but we have reduc the amount of high level wast with vitrif and almost all the wast is low level wast i wish thei would have dug a littl deeper and explain there is a good chanc that reprocess will gener much less wast than direct dispos in the futur thank to a reduct in the amount of fuel we will us final i wish thei had taken a long term view and address the basic issu that we were discuss earlier that plutonium is an import energi resourc for the futur and look at our present situat in move toward it applic ef what about my wife s statement that develop the fbr will be a total wast washimi a veri long time is need for technolog develop just look at airplan 30 or 40 year pass between the wright brother and jet aircraft even when we begin full fledg commerci of the fbr and work veri hard at it the develop will take 30 to 40 year current we ar work veri hard on research and develop but we should look beyond that and make decis base on the fbr us as a sourc of energi fbr commerci and domest mox product far awai ef the power industri is lean toward domest product of mox fuel and i believ that prepar for domest mox product ar on of the issu in the upcom long term plan review suzuki construct ha begun on the reprocess plant at rokkasho villag under the premis that it is for the util of recov plutonium and uranium the most effect wai for util it is in the form of mox natur we must think about the structur of a domest mox fuel busi the electr power compani ar encourag by thi move up till now pnc ha conduct technolog develop mainli in the three field of uranium enrich reprocess and mox fuel as thei relat to the fuel cycl the mainstream of uranium enrich and reprocess ha alreadi move to the privat sector so that leav us with mox fuel when we look at the path of uranium enrich and reprocess in their transit from technolog develop to privat sector commerci it appear there ar wai to make better us of the fruit of technolog develop the biggest problem is personnel i believ it is veri import how we util the peopl who dealt with develop of mox fuel process technolog at pnc and who current possess vital know how when we make the transit to commerci i hope that thi time when we decid the direct of the busi structur we consid thi issu much more carefulli than we did in the past ef i have seen the plutonium fuel no 3 develop lab at pnc tokai work as you look at it from the front there is an fbr line on the left and an atr line on the right four year have pass sinc the build for the atr line wa complet but it is still stand empti on reason is the delai at the oma site for the atr demonstr reactor of cours i think pnc should bring in peopl from fuel manufactur and togeth make mox fuel both for the oma reactor and for the plutonium thermal reactor for power compani us suzuki just as you sai the kei point will be how well we make us of thi opportun and tie in the pnc expert in thi field to commerci the atr line is veri import and it must proce on schedul from now on i have a feel that the peopl involv with mox fuel ar take a rather narrow approach mox fuel allow rather flexibl design to be made and if we would do so i think cost effect streamlin with mox fuel will make a big jump forward i hope thi view will be includ when decis ar made the heater on the sinter furnac for make fuel for monju broke down recent delai critic the caus ar rather complex but fuel for the monju ha a plutonium content of more than 20 percent with a maximum enrich of about 25 percent pnc ha been make fuel for fugen for a long time but that fuel ha a plutonium content of 1 2 percent about 3 percent maximum go from that level to number in the 20 percent rang mean a plutonium content 10 time higher becaus it is difficult to guarante the same kind of yield for a fuel with 10 time more plutonium i expect thi will becom an issu from now on we can us a special campaign to make fuel for the fbr but in the futur we must make it on a product line that flow continu in the same wai we make fuel for the lwr todai a veri import issu will be how we achiev that level and in that sens i would like to see the no 3 develop lab be activ util ef when a convers wa held thi spring among some of the most promin leader in thi field it wa leak that on issu for studi in the long term plan hear will be consid the present trend whether the electr power industri can actual build a second or third demonstr reactor even though the present long term plan state that two or three will be built judg from the present trend when we look at the most recent hear in the fbr develop project expert subcommitte some peopl mai propos an intern project for build the second and third demonstr reactor like iter in which japan the us ec and russia have begun engin design for an experiment fusion reactor washimi right now there is a hot debat go on about when the first demonstr reactor will be built the present long term plan call for construct on the first demonstr reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990s but it must be suffici base on our experi with monju and we must still get some kind of yardstick on cost effect furthermor there ar some technic problem that ar still at the r d stage howev the attitud of the electr power industri is that we should forg steadili ahead with the develop of the first demonstr reactor as far as the second and third demonstr reactor ar concern we should make our decis with the belief that thi technolog will make steadi progress we ar try veri hard to make our first demonstr reactor a larg reactor like the super phenix in franc but it mai not turn out that wai thi is my person opinion but the larger the reactor the more time it take to deal with ani kind of troubl so i have a feel that we mai eventu have a small reactor i believ that in addit to our experi with the first demonstr reactor our concept for the second demonstr reactor will be base on research on the variou possibl for build it in the futur the third reactor li even farther down the road and although i am not complet sure i expect that on import standard for make the decis will be how much it will cost i believ it is import to reach a consensu on how much of the current fee for electr should be us to pai for the cost of futur energi ef mr suzuki you made an excel comment at the last meet of the expert subcommitte you said that if we proce by focus on the reactor the burden will be pass on to the fuel cycl and we will be forc to think about reactor in term of the fuel cycl suzuki i made that statement right after we got the new that pnc continu sinter furnac that wa make fuel for monju had broken down and that monju critic would suffer a long delai as we seek higher and higher level of perform in reactor specif the burden fall on the fuel and thing get veri difficult from the standpoint of acquir fuel monju fuel ha low densiti and the rod ar short and thin when ask pnc could not sai it wa unabl to make that kind of fuel actual make the fuel a littl thicker and much denser would have been a lot easier lwr fuel can be made that wai pnc ha to make fuel that is harder to make than lwr fuel i think it will be import in the futur to adopt design in which the reactor and the cycl ar technolog in balanc now we ar concern with the process of make the transit to commerci so a veri import issu will be how much we can improv our technolog in that sens short term cost effect and so forth ar irrelev it is import that we think of thi as technolog link to the futur and in that sens i want to see plan for demonstr reactor that take the fuel cycl into account expect for new long term plan ef in close do you have ani request for the long term plan expert subcommitte washimi as a basic line of reason i hope that the long term plan will not place too much emphasi on immedi result energi technolog take a veri long time to develop so it is not wise to make decis base onli on the present it is import to take a long rang view i also hope the committe look at thing from the standpoint of the gener populac i am sure that the basic framework of the long term plan will be clearli written down but i am wonder whether it could be put in the form of a stori that averag citizen can understand peopl concern with atom energi can understand if you sai in the year two thousand and someth or other we will do thi but i do not think the averag citizen understand why i think we need to publish a kind of cliff s note to the long term plan suzuki i work at a univers and deal with young student i want to think that in the futur thei will be activ in the field of atom energi in that sens the long term plan is veri import and i think most peopl ar particularli interest in what will happen to the fbr project in the nuclear fuel recycl expert subcommitte report we issu two year ago we said that we would need roughli 10 20 ton of plutonium for the fbr i think thi time we should express quantiti more precis if we do so i think that peopl involv in reprocess will be encourag and the target for mox manufactur will also becom clear of cours cost effect is veri import and power compani reflect thi in electr rate power compani cannot proce on their own if the cost is too high therefor the most import problem for the upcom long term plan session will be express the fbr project in a wai that most peopl can go along with not onli in the field of atom energi but in other field as well japan is show her econom and technolog strength to the rest of the world we must ask whether japan alon should bear the risk of technolog develop that will benefit the whole world as econom burden continu to increas intern cooper often mean mere provid fund atom energi is differ becaus by pour both econom and technic strength into technolog develop of the fbr we will benefit other nation as well in the futur i believ we have arriv at an ag in which that will be our goal if that is the case there is a possibl the fbr project mai be consid quit ration even if the financi cost is consider washimi i agre complet we must approach thi from the standpoint that the plutonium recycl fbr is not onli energi for japan but energi for the whole world we must also look at it as someth for futur gener as well as for those aliv todai therefor cost effect come into plai becaus the monei will come from fee paid by todai s user of electr in japan basic we must consid the futur of the world s energi and ask ourselv how much of the burden our gener should bear

promyshlennyi vestnik present to it reader russia s energi strategi thi is the russian feder s integr state fuel and energi program for the period up to the year 2010 it signific is determin by a

third of the countri s currenc revenu in contrast to the major of countri russia s tek fuel and energi complex is not simpli an infrastructur sector of it nation economi but rather the foundat of the

there ar special reason for thi ye on of the world s most power system for ensur vital need and econom secur ha been creat in russia our countri gener more than 10 percent of the world product of fuel also certain is the fact that russia s fuel and energi complex is current fulli meet the need of the public and materi product for fuel and energi we would remind you that last year 70 percent of all currenc revenu wa also obtain through the export of energi resourc and the cross deliveri of commod resourc from the ci commonwealth of independ state for industri and consum need wa ensur it is no secret howev that the overal amount of power output ha fallen by 20 percent over the last 5 year and is continu to fall just in 1993 russia produc 8 percent fewer energi resourc than it could have but the countri ha not felt an acut shortag of them for a simpl reason under the condit of the grow product slump in all sector energi consumpt ha fallen sharpli in both industri and agricultur so the energi suffici ha turn out to be larg rel moreov the tek ha sold the produc output to it tradit consum within the countri on credit as a rule a debt which ha reach the gigant sum of 10 trillion rubl r which is larger than half of all of russia s debt taken togeth thi illusori wealth ha driven the economi s power complex into a financi impass call upon to enliven the economi it ha had to hold back on even the most necessari retool not to mention the introduct of new product yet inde in order to maintain for exampl oil product at least at the current level up to 5 billion annual need to be

while the rest here and there ar warm the high heaven even thi small list of problem testifi to the fact that crisi situat ar make themselv known in the energi sector with ever increas imperi how can thei be overcom with the most minim of loss what kind of energi polici should be pursu so that in the final talli it would yield a percept benefit for each inhabit of the countri the answer to these question ar provid by russia s energi strategi the draft of which ha just been complet first of all in all sector it is necessari to get rid of the antiqu habit of regard the tek as a gratuit donor to the economi becaus the transit to market relat caus by the radic chang in russia s social and econom structur is by no mean a on wai street howev alreadi the first reform step within the fuel and energi complex the establish of commerci compani which fastidi began to establish market structur around themselv and not just to produc the raw materi but also to process it provid up to date servic to the consum and deliv the end product to him for the price which thei actual cost caus a squall of complet unfound accus in the mass media the drafter of the new russian energi strategi consid it necessari to talk with the public right awai in order to make their point in thi controversi the truth behind the accus that the energi supplier have revis the price for energi resourc caus a new sharp surg of inflat is obviou over the year of the wast cannibalist economi there develop in our countri a careless squander of energi resourc in product and everydai life at a level exceed their expenditur in industri countri by a factor of 2 3 market relat have insert their own authorit correct into domest practic henceforth the expenditur of energi will be control by the rubl it is understand that break an ingrain habit is hard but it must be done even though not everyon like thi as for inflat the energi resourc price revis is least of all at fault here here ar the offici statist data for last year the share of fuel outlai in the overal industri expenditur amount to onli 7 8 percent allus have been made to the veri rapid rise of price in domest machin build thei ar realli strike last year thei jump 500 percent howev a detail analysi ha shown that the price in machin build rose onli by 25 percent due to fuel and energi resourc thu the new price for energi resourc which accord to the calcul amount to just 30 percent of world price plai almost no role in the acceler of the inflationari spiral and the market approach to price set in the fuel and energi complex should be exoner in the ey of the public then where doe the root of all the problem lie our specialist believ that it li in the exorbitantli high tax in their opinion the tek is so hobbl by the tax fetter that it ha been liter left without the mean of subsist independ expert from oxford cite on more reason the harsh credit polici accord to their calcul up to 83 percent of inflat is occur becaus of the high credit rate ani enterpris forc to obtain monei from the bank at enorm interest rate in order to surviv will try to jack up the price for it own product a new round of inflat inevit follow thi it is perfectli obviou that loan financ invest plan under such condit will remain just plan thi is the veri stranglehold on the tek from which it is try unsuccessfulli in the meanwhil to free

contact corros problem of aluminum steel with aluminum steel clad the uniqu featur of nissan s aq x is the adopt of an iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur by us an aluminum alloi for certain structur compon and for the outer and inner panel for it door front hood front fender and trunk lid instead of the aluminum alloi that is not suitabl for deep draw mold steel sheet ar us for the outer and inner panel of the rear fender which ha a sever curv surfac as a result of adopt the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur the weight of the aq x is approxim 20 percent less than that of previou bodi made of steel outer panel thi drastic weight reduct seem to indic that the adopt of the hybrid structur is expect to meet futur auto specif sinc accord to on offici no matter how much a bodi structur is ration the weight of the exist steel bodi will be reduc onli by sever percent at best gener whenev sheet steel and aluminum alloi part ar us togeth the joint ar attack by corros that result from the contact of dissimilar metal the corros is commonli call galvan corros and such joint have to be avoid altogeth in auto bodi construct therefor auto bodi part in which aluminum alloi can be us ar limit to such part as front hood trunk lid and hing part that function as a lid such as quickli detach sun roof otherwis like the nsx sport car of honda motor co ltd all the bodi ha to be made with an aluminum alloi with onli the smallest area of contact with steel nissan solv the problem of contact corros between steel and aluminum alloi for the aq x by insert steel aluminum alloi clad piec in the joint the steel aluminum alloi clad piec ar insert between an aluminum alloi outer panel and a steel inner panel when thei ar to be spot weld to form a monocoqu bodi the aluminum alloi layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel and the steel layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the steel inner panel befor the entir assembl is spot weld as a result aluminum is weld to aluminum and steel is weld to steel as a whole the aluminum outer panel and the steel inner panel ar bond to each other nissan is us the same cold roll steel panel spcd spce as

onli on spot weld voltag is requir for spot weld steel to steel as well as aluminum to aluminum yoshitaka kurihara chief research at the vehicular research laboratori of nissan s gener research institut sai thi we chose the ratio of the aluminum alloi to the steel in the clad materi in such a wai that on voltag can do both weld job simultan clad materi have two atom layer of dissimilar metal arrang tightli next to each other so no air can infiltr between the two layer thu neither oxid nor reduct take place as a result no potenti differ is gener between the steel and aluminum alloi layer and that prevent ani corros process from take place between the two dissimilar metal nissan improv the bodi rigid of the aq x through both design and materi and accord to kurihara both bend and twist rigid ar 20 percent higher than those of previou car of the same class nissan successfulli prevent ani loss of rigid despit the incorpor of aluminum the gaug of the aluminum alloi sheet like that of previou aluminum alloi part wa made 1 4 time that of the sheet steel to maintain the same tensil rigid as that of a sheet steel bodi the separ of steel from aluminum in an auto bodi the critic process in the recycl of car to be dispos of wa made technic possibl by nissan for the aq x by heat to approxim 500 c a brittl intermetal compound is form at the interfac of the steel and aluminum alloi layer of the clad materi which make it easi to separ the two layer with light impact nissan believ that the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur is a weight reduct technolog with a high probabl of implement becaus the advantag of weight reduct can be balanc against the ad cost through the optim of the ratio of cheap sheet steel to lightweight aluminum alloi accord to kurihara as far as the cost problem is concern although it is difficult to make a thorough assess at thi time it appear that a certain cost increas is unavoid not onli doe the aluminum alloi cost approxim three time as much as the steel the ratio of the materi unit price x the ratio of the densiti but the product cost is also high for the aluminum alloi becaus the spot weld electrod s life is shorter for the alloi than for steel audi exhibit space frame car with aluminum bodi germani s audi motor corp exhibit an audi space frame asf car with a space frame structur assembl with aluminum alloi outer and inner panel audi plan to us thi asf model for the mass test product of the a8 which is to replac the current sold luxuri v8 the a8 is schedul to be introduc to the german market in mai 1994 although the price of the a8 ha not been announc it ha been rumor that the price will exce the price of the v8 of 11 4 million it is specul that the car could afford an all aluminum alloi bodi becaus of it high price statu and the moder product rate of approxim 2 400 vehicl per month most of todai s passeng car have a monocoqu bodi that function as the structur materi for outer and inner panel in contrast the frame alon of the space frame structur function as the structur compon for the bodi and outer panel ar primarili us as the exterior partit therefor the space frame structur ha the advantag of be abl to maintain rigid despit the adopt of materi less rigid than steel such as aluminum alloi and resin for the outer and inner panel anoth import advantag of the space frame structur is that it enabl the us of compar cheaper extrud materi for the frame structur compon extrud materi can be made with heavier gaug for us in spot that requir high rigid or thei can be made with thinner gaug for us in spot that requir low rigid furthermor even if section with insuffici rigid happen to be construct in a space frame structur made of extrud frame the weak can easili be compens for with stiffen rib for the space frame structur of the asf car exhibit at the show the lowest cost extrud materi wa us in the largest quantiti the next lowest cost die cast materi wa us in the next to largest quantiti and the highest cost roll materi wa us in the smallest quantiti howev base on the concept disclos in 1991 in which extrud frame materi were to be connect with a die cast bond materi for the asf concept model mani observ at the show seem to get the impress that the us rate of the extrud materi wa less than previous announc audi us an aluminum manganes silicon base alloi for the extrud materi and an aluminum silicon manganes base alloi for the vacuum die cast materi what attract the audienc s attent is the us of a press mold roll sheet materi in a complex shape for the part call the c pillar of the roof section of the asf car bodi the chassi of the asf car wa form by rivet the roof and panel such as door and fender that were made by press mold of aluminum alloi the panel were rivet instead of spot weld to produc bond strength that is higher by approxim 30 percent and to elimin the anti product environ element of spark which would be caus by weld approxim 70 percent of the bond wa done with rivet the rest wa

wa rel behind mitsubishi did not quit solv the problem inher in plastic bodi i e the usag of a recycl thermoplast resin for horizont outer panel with the hsr iv mitsubishi is said to be experi with a multilay thermoplast resin outer sheet in which a foam agent is sandwich between skin layer in order to increas the sheet gaug to gain suffici tensil rigid without sacrif weight reduct the most uniqu featur of the hsr iv wa the elastom elast aero tail that can tailor the shape of the tail end section to the run condit in order to modifi the aerodynam environ under normal condit the tail end is flat howev under certain run condit the tail end rise to form a triangular upheav i e the upheav function as an air spoiler that gener a downward forc to counterbal the buoyanc the car ha under high speed drive condit also when the car is driven in revers the spoiler remain down so as to maintain good rear visibl for the driver in fact a similar mechan had been incorpor in the hsr iii although thi time the durabl of the elastom wa drastic improv to the level of readi implement at the same time mitsubishi improv the design to make the upheav area smaller the tail section is cover with a skin like materi of a stretchabl special thermoplast elastom to form an upheav that is smooth and seamless detail of thi elastom have not yet been disclos although it is said to be a styren base elastom with maximum elong of 600 800 percent the kei for the elastom is the manifest of the durabl for repetit stretch a polyolefin base thermoplast resin call tpo a blend of polypropylen and ethylen propylen rubber epr had been us for the hsr iii sup 1 although the resin wa not durabl enough for the tail section to be commerci sachio miwa of the materi technolog depart sai that thi time mitsubishi in it experi achiev an elastom durabl that could cope with 3 000 4 000 repetit stretch which is equival to the 10 year of us therefor he continu it will be possibl to commerci the tail section in the next few year an approxim 100mm high upheav can be repeatedli form on the tail with a stretch of approxim 300 percent for the elastom in contrast to ordinari thermoplast elastom which show a nearli linear elong stress relationship thi particular elastom show a rubberlik nonlinear elong stress relationship by requir small stress when stretch by less than 100 percent and then suddenli increas the stress requir when elong exce 100 percent mitsubishi coat the tail with a urethan elast paint that could stretch up to 300 percent in order to be abl to cope with the elastom s stretch accord to miwa mitsubishi is plan other aerodynam improv us for thi elastom for exampl he continu it is possibl to have deform bodi section that cover the upper halv of tire so that excel

improv the ir transmitt of thi glass ha not yet been divulg although nissan claim that the transmitt level ha been suffici reduc gener speak when glass is treat for uv and ir screen it also tend to reflect more radio wave for exampl in the past when a rear window glass with a print antenna wa treat for ir screen the perform of the antenna tend to deterior accord to nissan the new uv ir cut glass can accommod a print antenna becaus the glass ha high radio wave penetr adopt of recycl resin for frp bumper reinforc fuji heavi industri ltd fhi came up with an interest propos for an exterior part fhi adopt glass fiber reinforc polypropylen gfrp for reinforc the bumper of it concept car jasmin which wa develop with the theme of promot conserv of resourc and energi and allevi traffic jam the idea also produc a weight reduct effect of the same level as that achiev by the aluminum alloi bumper reinforc which ha recent becom the mainstream for bumper construct the choic of the gfrp permit us to deciph fhi philosophi on resin recycl the spokesperson from the design section of fhi subaru technic headquart sai thi resin have recent been treat badli becaus of their implic in term of preserv of the environ realist speak howev some part of the auto bodi have to be made of resin in order to be abl to recycl resin some bodi section or compon must be save for the us of recycl resin we want to propos the gfrp bumper reinforc as on of the most promis compon in thi categori fhi think wa that the bumper reinforc which doesn t need a high qualiti appear would be the ideal spot to us recycl resin sinc the reinforc is hidden behind the bumper fascia engin attract the most attent at the engin exhibit were nissan s vq engin which the develop hope will becom the mainstream engin of the late 90s and mazda s rotari engin system which is design to be us for hydrogen burn car in the futur signific weight reduct through abund us of aluminum alloi for vq engin the vq engin is expect to be instal in ordinari car as earli as 1994 it is a v type engin with a displac of 2 3 liter the engin drew attent becaus it demonstr how much weight reduct fuel cost reduct and exhaust clean could be improv for the exist gasolin burn reciproc engin materi technolog wa fulli appli in an attempt to reduc the weight of the engin compar with the current vg engin the weight of the cylind block wa reduc by 29 kg or 50 percent in addit to a weight decreas of 5 kg or 17 percent in the primari move system and a total weight decreas of 9 kg or 19 percent for the move valv system plu the cylind head the drastic weight reduct of 50 percent for the cylind block wa achiev through the replac of the exist cast iron fc with the aluminum alloi adc 12 the block wa mold with a high pressur die cast machin instal at iwaki plant nissan s design state of the art engin plant although the machin is call a die cast machin it is a type of high pressur cast method with a slightli low cast pressur of approxim 100 mpa todai honda and mazda ar the onli automak that ar adopt a high pressur cast aluminum alloi for cylind block in 1982 nissan had adopt a high pressur cast product for the cylind block of the 1 liter displac engin for the then new model call march subsequ howev nissan us product made of aluminum alloi includ ac4b cast with a low pressur of approxim 1 mpa for cylind block in it campaign for alumin of larg engin high pressur could not be us for cast becaus sand mold had to be us to form the cool water passag thi problem wa solv for the vq engin by adopt an open deck type cast method without us the mold the cylind block for the vq engin had been design by cae for rigid construct as well as for the instal of cool water passag therefor accord to a spokesperson for the first power train design depart of the power train develop divis although the block ha an intric shape for high pressur cast the cast method wa chosen as a result of optim with cae fluid analysi the adc 12 high pressur cast product wa also us to make the compon that unit the oil pan and the lower crankcas situat under the cylind block unlik previou oil pan that were place below the cylind block mere as an attach thi compon also function as a structur compon to increas rigid of the overal engin becaus of thi an extra effort wa made to decreas the weight of the cylind block moreov the intric shape cylind block wa made of a low pressur cast product from ac4b the ideal wai to reduc the weight of an engin is to reduc the weight of the move part of an engin when part that undergo reciproc or rotari motion ar made light not onli is less drive energi requir but also the energi loss due to slide is reduc in addit the engin s revolut limit and respons will also increas therefor sai director kenichi sasaki of nissan the vq engin wa develop as the basic engin model that will be us for the next 15 year nissan also succeed in achiev a drastic weight reduct of approxim 20 percent for ac8a made piston that were made in a ration shape creat via the full us of cae in stress and heat flow analys similarli connect rod were also made lighter by reduc the diamet of the pin at their smaller end which ar link with the piston thi weight reduct wa possibl becaus of the reduct in the piston s weight and becaus of the improv fatigu strength that result from the creation of an appropri compress stress layer on the rod s surfac by hard shot peen hydrogen ga rotari car achiev 230 km cruis distanc for the last sever year mazda ha been energet develop a near futur engin in the form of a hydrogen ga rotari engin for low pollut vehicl the engin at the show drew much attent becaus it mai soon be us in combin with an improv version of todai s gasolin reciproc engin if low pollut car ar requir to meet exhaust emiss regul of the state of california in the unit state mazda s hr x2 concept car which carri the rotari engin displac of 2 x 654 cc achiev a cruis distanc of 230 km at a constant speed of 60 km h with 43 m sup 3 normal of hydrogen ga store in a fuel tank which contain a hydrogen occlud alloi the mass of thi hydrogen occlud alloi contain fuel tank is approxim 300 kg which is about the same as that of a batteri for an electr vehicl howev accord to director takanori minami the hydrogen ga rotari engin car ha the edg over the electr vehicl becaus the cruis distanc for the former is twice that of the 100 km or so for the latter the hydrogen occlud alloi is a misch metal nickel alloi mmni sub 5 mm is a mixtur of rare earth metal thi alloi which weigh 18 kg is pack in a thin long cell with dimens of approxim 11x7x68 cm arrang insid the cell with a grid like cross section ar fin made of extrud no 5000 aluminum alloi thin pipe for circul warm and cold water ar instal at the intersect of the grid format both end of the cell ar weld togeth by tungsten inert ga weld to form a tank the hydrogen occlud alloi is heat or cool by water or cold water us the engin s cool water for the desorpt or absorpt of hydrogen ga a total of 18 cell make up the tank with the total weight of the alloi be 250 kg which is locat on the trunk floor the rotari engin mount in the hr x2 is an improv model of the 13b base the new engin ha a higher output as a result of a chang in the intak process instead of the simultan intak of both air and hydrogen as in the old engin hydrogen ga is inject into the combust chamber after air ha been led into it from a separ port mazda is proud of the new engin s perform level which is equal to that of the exist gasolin reciproc engin with a maximum output maximum torqu of approxim 96 000 w 170 n m 130 ps 17 0 kgf m elsewher fhi cylind sleev made of an aluminum alloi with excel wear resist and machin wa also worthi of attent thi aluminum alloi wa 3ha with a composit of al 14 weight percent si a product of australia s comalco ltd the uniqu featur of thi alloi is the superfin size of precipit intermetal compound grain 10 m electr vehicl at the show electr vehicl maker exhibit low pollut car to show their concern for the environ and appear to demonstr the philosophi that car of the near futur should be made differ from current gasolin burn reciproc engin car exhibit at the show were a multitud of electr vehicl includ toyota s ev 50 and nissan s abeniiru ev repres low pollut vehicl of the near futur on of the factor that have been push automak into the develop of these electr vehicl is the auto emiss regul of the state of california us that start in 1994 mandat the step by step introduct of low pollut vehicl accord to the regul which ar the strictest in the world 2 percent of the total number of vehicl to be sold must start in 1998 consist of zero emiss vehicl zev that emit no nonmethan base organ ga in exhaust a toyota offici sai that low pollut vehicl emerg in forc becaus it will soon be 1998 and we don t have much time to evalu the vehicl s reliabl and durabl a spokesperson at honda technic research institut sai thi todai it is the time for us to tell everybodi how far we have come along technic and how technolog can be appli to low pollut vehicl todai two type of low pollut vehicl have been propos on is an electr automobil that get it motiv power from a motor driven by electr store in a batteri and the other is a hybrid car that is equip with an intern combust engin to supplement the batteri power so it can run with larger output and for a longer cruis distanc than the electr automobil from the standpoint of practic both type requir the further develop of an effici batteri and a motor at thi show displai batteri were noteworthi for the fact that thei seem to need much further improv sodium sulfur batteri with high energi densiti suzuki motor co ltd exhibit the ee 10 which wa develop within the concept of the lightweight hybrid citi commut intend for citi drive thi car normal run on electr as well as on a 660 cc methanol engin for high speed long distanc drive accord to it specif thi car wa equip with a sodium sulfur batteri that wa under joint develop by yuasa batteri co ltd yuasa tokyo thi batteri is uniqu in that it ha the highest energi densiti of all the electr car batteri current commerci or under develop the energi densiti is an index for cruis distanc per charg the greater the energi densiti the greater the distanc the car can travel without further charg of the batteri as of now the energi densiti of a sodium sulfur batteri is 100 wh kg approxim 2 5 time that of a lead batteri theoret a sodium sulfur batteri can attain an energi densiti that is about 10 time that of a lead batteri accord to a spokesperson at yuasa s tokyo develop laboratori moreov the output densiti of a sodium sulfur batteri which indic a car s acceler capabl hill climb capabl and maximum speed is 150 w kg and it charg life the number of toler time for repeat charg and discharg is 1 000 time both of these number ar compar with those of a lead batteri the sodium sulfur batteri with the abov describ excel perform is construct like a sandwich roll into a cylindr form with a solid electrolyt of b alumina b al sub 2 o sub 3 between the sodium plate anod and the sodium sulfur na sub 2 s sub x plate cathod it is claim that the batteri convert energi at 100 percent effici becaus no side reaction occur in the batteri s electrochem process thi batteri ha the advantag of undergo no self discharg and be made of materi that come from abund resourc on the other hand it is not easi to handl accord to the fire servic law sodium and sulfur which ar us for the electrod ar classifi under categori 3 spontan ignit and water prohibit substanc and categori 2 combust solid respect their us ar restrict in that registr with the fire defens agenc is requir when more than a given quantiti of either of the two materi is handl in fact a sodium sulfur batteri wa not instal in the ee 10 at the show the fire servic law prohibit the batteri from be brought into the exhibit hall in addit to that problem technic problem still remain with the sodium sulfur batteri for exampl becaus of it high oper temperatur of abov 300 c the batteri need to be heat for charg and need to be protect from cool while the car is be driven to solv thi temperatur problem it will be necessari to develop a heat insul vessel and a heat mechan that doe not interfer with the high energi densiti i e the low weight of the sodium sulfur batteri accord to the design depart of suzuki sodium sulfur batteri develop ha just begun from the standpoint of resourc we expect more from thi batteri than from the nickel base batteri and it will eventu replac the lead batteri long life nickel hydrogen batteri zev favorit lead batteri the nickel base batteri is the gener name for a group of batteri that us nickel for the cathod there ar four type of nickel base batteri depend on the composit of the anod cadmium iron zinc and hydrogen occlud alloi includ lani sub 5 of those automak appear to be stai awai from niccad batteri which us cadmium for the anod becaus of the metal s toxic of the remain three the nickel hydrogen occlud alloi nickel hydrogen batteri is current in the posit closest to commerci becaus of it excel balanc between energi densiti output densiti and long life for exampl daihatsu motor co ltd mount a nickel hydrogen batteri in it hybrid car ev sedan which ha a maximum speed of 120 km h and a cruis distanc of 450 km although detail of compon of the batteri includ the hydrogen occlud alloi have not been disclos it perform reportedli includ an energi densiti of 65 wh kg which is 1 5 2 time that of the lead batteri and an output densiti of 170 w kg which is 1 5 time that of the lead batteri most remark is the batteri s life which is said to be as durabl as the car itself even with daili repetit of charg and discharg honda also exhibit a nickel hydrogen batteri which had been develop jointli with matsushita batteri co ltd moriguchi citi osaka prefectur and ovon batteri corp a us batteri maker thi batteri s energi densiti and output densiti ar approxim 60 wh kg and 170 w kg respect which ar about the same as those for daihatsu s batteri accord to honda s tochigi research institut howev the batteri s life is current good for onli 500 cycl of charg and discharg which we intend to extend to the car s life tochigi research institut also sai thi it should take sever more year befor thi batteri can be mass produc honda need to ensur that the excel perform of a singl cell will not deterior when cell ar combin to form a modul furthermor befor the nickel hydrogen batteri can be commerci the recoveri and re us technolog for hydrogen occlud alloi must be establish accord to tokyo develop laboratori yuasa and someth must be done to bring the cost down from what is now approxim 15 time that of the lead batteri still mani problem need to be solv for both sodium sulfur and nickel hydrogen batteri automak particularli nissan and honda seem to have the opinion that lead batteri ar suitabl for zev from the standpoint of reliabl safeti eas of handl and cost and nickel base batteri need to be develop primarili for the post zev futur both the evx which honda is think of commerci in the futur and the abeniiru ev for which nissan is plan limit sale carri a lead batteri a spokesperson from the third develop center in toyota sai that for the time be our main effort will be focus on perform improv for lead batteri such as low temperatur perform and life for electr vehicl low pollut vehicl includ electr and hybrid car that us a batteri as the sourc of energi gener cost two to five time more than exist car accord to nissan s technic vehicl develop laboratori in order to reduc the cost of an electr car it is critic to lower the cost of it exclus compon in addit to the batteri at the same time it mai also be necessari to further develop the heretofor nurtur weight reduct technolog so that the batteri s weight can be easili dealt with in the context of the reduc weight of the vehicl hybrid electr car charg batteri while in motion mitsubishi show off it hybrid electr car the esr for it low fuel consumpt and low pollut thi electr car carri a compact gener oper by a gasolin engin for the purpos of charg the batteri when the batteri is suffici charg the car is driven by current from the batteri howev when the capac of the batteri becom low the gener is actuat to charg the batteri without the car stop thi is call the seri hybrid method for hybrid oper the car while it batteri is be charg the engin for drive the gener is driven at a constant revolut that is extrem effici and gener the least emiss per output the idea behind the develop of the esr wa that by instal the gener as the power sourc less transmiss loss can be encount than with power transmit from a thermal power plant therefor from the overal standpoint less fossil fuel is consum and less carbon dioxid is gener base on that idea minim of energi loss wa stress throughout the develop of the esr includ the

dust ignit in mine 1990 93 nire most of the energi need in the peopl s republ of china ar suppli in the form of coal at slightli less than 11 metric ton china boast the world s largest annual output of coal in recent year most of the drill for coal ha been done in mine and in view of the fact that work condit have deterior as drill ha reach deeper level and the fact that there ha been an upsurg in both the percentag of accid and number of major mine disast govern relat organ have shown great concern over these matter and have given high prioriti to promot r d on mine safeti and secur thi project is meant to tackl the more seriou accid that ar caus by the ignit of ga and coal dust in the mine and look into the mechan by which ignit is caus by metal spark in mine and look for wai to prevent thi from occur base on studi with coal mine explos thi is the final year of thi research project so an effort will be made to put togeth a comprehens studi that includ the ignit characterist of coal mine in china the characterist of ga and coal dust ignit caus by spark produc in the collis of metal or by the heat gener by mechan friction and the characterist of ga and coal dust ignit that is caus by abnorm blast all of which have been item carri out so far by experiment research research to develop process for simpl treatment of highli concentr organ effluent 1991 93 nibh effluent treatment ha becom a seriou problem in southeast asian countri which ar undergo rapid industri howev it is almost imposs to introduc much of the effluent treatment equip develop in japan to these countri becaus the run cost ar quit high and a great deal of expertis is need for mainten and upkeep of the equip that be the case thi research will try to perfect a simpl treatment method for highli concentr effluent that is suitabl for southeast asian countri by introduc techniqu such as microorgan immobil in a low cost treatment of methan ga and by develop an easi to maintain method of treatment research on explor and develop of underground resourc in mongolia 1991 94 gsj thi is a basic research project carri out in cooper with a research partner in mongolia that is design to promot a more modern and effici mean of explor and develop the rich miner and energi resourc deposit in the mountain plateau of mongolia thi research will be divid into the follow two segment accord to object and mean 1 research on miner resourc distribut and mean of explor thi segment will involv research on the interrelationship between magma activ and those base metal such as copper lead and zinc as well as rare metal such as tungsten tin molybdenum niobium tantalum and rare earth and bring to light the distribut of those resourc and appropri method of explor 2 research on coal and oil shell thi segment will have to do with geolog research on the rich mongolian coal bed and accompani oil shell research on lignocellulos polyurethan 1991 94 nimc in the coffe and sugar cane produc countri such as costa rica and those locat in the tropic and subtrop area of the world there ar now no effect us for the larg quantiti of secondari product such as coffe bean shell or bagass produc from these

and intern secur text a high level us deleg to includ repres of congress and the depart of energi will arriv in russia in mai to consult on the issu of shut down nuclear reactor in the close citi of tomsk 7 and krasnoyarsk 26 thi visit by american govern expert is take place within the framework of agreement reach between chernomyrdin and gore in decemb 1993 regard the creation of a joint work group to studi and develop a number of issu connect with nuclear arm reduct dure the mai visit there ar plan to studi opportun for achiev greater transpar and irrevers in nuclear arm reduct and place civilian plutonium and surplu militari plutonium under monitor discuss the technic detail of mutual inspect of site where part made of fission materi ar store and discuss possibl mean of util plutonium to prevent it accumul thi is a multifacet issu and involv not onli technolog aspect but seriou polit aspect as well by the mid 1980 s the nuclear arsen creat by the former soviet union and the unit state dure the cold war total more than 60 000 nuclear warhead of that number more than on half belong to the ussr the process of nuclear disarma begun by the two superpow and the develop of that process in which the collaps ussr place ha been taken by russia will result in a sharp reduct in the size of that arsen in complianc with the start i and start ii treati the total number of strateg warhead retain by each side must not exce 3 500 by the year 2003 take into consider unilater pledg to reduc tactic nuclear weapon over the next decad russia and the unit state will have to destroi sever ten of thousand of warhead the result will be a sharp reduct in the threat of nuclear war accord to variou estim the process of destroi nuclear warhead will result in russia and the unit state free up a total of approxim 900 metric ton of highli enrich uranium and more than 100 metric ton of weapon grade plutonium approxim 50 metric ton for each countri these two materi ar the basi for the manufactur of nuclear deton devic it take 3 5 kg of plutonium to make a singl nuclear devic and three or four time that much highli enrich uranium therefor acquisit of these materi is a prioriti goal for state seek to acquir nuclear weapon the exist of surplu fission materi present a threat both to russian and us nation secur and to world secur retent of those materi retain the possibl that thei will be us to make nuclear weapon again therebi undermin the irrevers of nuclear disarma effort the emerg of ani crisi in russian american relat could quit easili provok a resurrect of the nuclear arm race therefor the goal should be the perman remov of these materi from the militari realm for russia the situat is made more difficult by intern polit instabl slacken of state monitor function and a difficult econom and environment situat consequ for it the choic of the optimum mean of util or destroi surplu weapon grade fission materi and monitor them is a task of prioriti import highli enrich uranium which consist primarili of the u 235 isotop mai be de enrich by mix it with natur uranium and then us in the product of fuel for the nuclear power industri an agreement ha been reach under which russia will sell the unit state uranium with an enrich level of 4 percent for the purpos of manufactur fuel within the framework of that agreement 500 metric ton of russian weapon grade uranium made avail through warhead elimin will be reprocess over a period of 20 year the valu of thi contract is in excess of 12 billion a separ agreement also provid for mutual monitor measur that will prevent russia from us uranium that doe not come from militari sourc and america from us the uranium for purpos not stipul in the contract thu there ar present no technic or polit obstacl to the util of weapon grade uranium plutonium is a differ matter neither russia nor the unit state current ha ani real mean of destroi it or util it realiz the nationwid scale of the plutonium issu and the fact that plutonium is on of the most close guard topic decis in regard to which ar made by a small group of expert i would like to direct public attent to thi matter as well plutonium is in the group of transuranium element and is number 94 in mendeleev s period tabl of element it doe not occur natur on earth and wa obtain by artifici mean the first sampl were creat by the seaborg group unit state in 1941 by bombard with neutron a uranium nucleu with a mass number of 238 just like u 235 plutonium 239 when it interact with neutron break down releas energi and neutron which ar essenti in maintain a nuclear chain reaction it is thi characterist that make it a strateg materi it is us to produc nuclear weapon and it small critic mass compar to u 235 make it prefer as a sourc of nuclear deton the toxic effect of plutonium on live organ is due to the alpha particl form when it decai alpha particl that enter live tissu destroi the tissu at the cellular level the radioact of on gram of weapon grade plutonium is approxim 0 7 curi therefor just 2 microgram of that type of plutonium in the bodi of a human be weigh 70 kg could prove fatal weapon grade plutonium is produc in special industri reactor with a low level of fuel combust these ar graphit water fuel channel type reactor with an output of around 2 000 megawatt there were 13 such reactor in the ussr russia five at chelyabinsk 65 five at tomsk 7 and three at krasnoyarsk 26 accord to variou estim the former ussr had produc approxim 150 metric ton of weapon grade plutonium there ar onli three reactor still in oper two at tomsk 7 and on at krasnoyarsk 26 but thei increas the quantiti of weapon grade plutonium for which russia no longer ha ani us by two metric ton a year plutonium can also be produc by ani nuclear power plant oper on ordinari uranium fuel but nuclear power plant reactor that have a high level of fuel burn up produc energi grade plutonium note that energi grade plutonium can also be us to made a nuclear deton devic all the technolog step involv in obtain plutonium ar accompani by the creation of a larg quantiti of liquid radioact wast the process of set up radiochem technolog and the oper thereof result in radioact contamin among other thing by plutonium of huge area where the radiochem product facil ar locat the mayak product associ in chelyabinsk oblast the siberian chemic combin at tomsk 7 and the krasnoyarsk mine and chemic combin at krasnoyarsk 26 restor these contamin area will requir a tremend amount of work accord to figur cite in american articl the product of a singl kilogram of weapon grade plutonium involv the creation of four cubic meter of liquid radioact wast with a radioact concentr of 2 yez expans unknown curi cubic meter and a plutonium concentr of 0 005 kg per cubic meter thu the former ussr product of 150 metric ton of weapon grade plutonium wa accompani by the creation of liquid radioact wast contain as much as half a billion curi of radioact a substanti portion of thi radioact wa pump into underground clai strata at tomsk 7 and krasnoyarsk 26 at the mayak combin these wast total 570 million curi ar store in steel contain the explos of on such contain in septemb 1957 result in the releas of 20 million curi of radiat into the environ and the radionuclid contamin of 23 000 sq km the popul of that area wa 272 000 more than on third of whom were subsequ resettl the current propos is that the store highli radioact wast left over from the defens program be vitrifi yet at thi time there is no reliabl function vitrif technolog plutonium s strateg signific and extrem high radioact requir a respons approach to it storag and the select of a mean of util it among the propos of variou mean of util weapon grade plutonium there ar two that ar prefer from the current standpoint us as fuel in nuclear power plant or vitrif along with the radioact wast creat dure it product with subsequ burial of the wast both these propos mean do not destroi the plutonium as such thei mere shift it from the weapon grade categori to reactor grade it is essenti to note that the greater portion of the plutonium produc in the world as of the present time by energi produc nuclear power station approxim 700 metric ton is contain in spent fuel it is assum that thi fuel s high level of radioact serv as a sort of physic self defens and prevent the extract of plutonium from it without highli develop technolog vitrif also reduc weapon grade plutonium to the standard for spent fuel at the present time none of the propos method ha ani convinc scientif technic or econom argument to support it therefor us of ani on of them will requir a preparatori period of at least 10 year in thi context cooper between variou organ in the unit state and russia aim at thoroughli studi all possibl mean of util plutonium appear highli desir it is worth note that the choic of a mean of util weapon grade plutonium will also be influenc by such factor as the adopt of a concept for the fuel and energi cycl a number of countri franc belgium russia and until recent great britain japan and germani support the concept of a close fuel cycl but onli franc ha made some progress with regard to the us of extract plutonium to produc fuel as of the present time russia ha extract approxim 30 metric ton of energi grade plutonium which is store at the mayak combin howev in contrast to franc russia doe not current possess the abil to util it the util concept for weapon grade plutonium drawn up by the ministri of atom energi presum that it will be us as fuel within the framework of that concept there ar plan to util either exist vver 1000 reactor or the bn 800 fast neutron reactor that ar under construct at the south ural atom power station it is possibl that special design thermal reactor will also be us vver 1000 reactor could be us to denatur weapon grade plutonium us a 30 percent mox fuel charg mox fuel is made from a mixtur of slightli enrich uranium and plutonium howev extens preliminari work will be necessari to assess the capabl of reactor control and protect system and to analyz the effect of possibl accid furthermor russia doe not have an exist enterpris produc mox fuel for the vver 1000 and construct of the rt 2 complex at krasnoyarsk 26 ha been suspend nor can the idea of us fast neutron reactor be implement immedi due to the lack of such reactor the exist bn 600 reactor us uranium fuel and bn 800 reactor ar still under construct complex 300 at the mayak combin design to produc mox fuel for bn 800 reactor is current in a state of 50 percent readi the unit state support the concept of an open fuel cycl and current reject reprocess primarili for two reason 1 reprocess would encourag the prolifer of nuclear weapon and 2 the us of uranium to produc fuel for power reactor is current much more econom than the us of plutonium although the unit state doe not preclud the possibl of reprocess fuel in the futur at the present time it ha no desir to signal that weapon grade plutonium ha ani signific as an energi sourc therebi give the nuclear power industri hope of receiv addit govern subsidi for the develop and construct of a new gener of nuclear reactor thu both countri will be forc to store their plutonium for a fairli long period of time we should note that storag is an expens undertak accord to variou estim the cost of store a singl gram of plutonium is 1 00 2 00 per year moreov russia accord to statement by ministri of atom energi offici doe not possess an appropri storag facil creat difficulti both with regard to the warhead disassembl process and the implement of reliabl monitor the cost of build an appropri storag facil is estim at sever hundr of million of dollar respond to request from russian offici the us senat ha pass a special act under which russia will be alloc 400 million to help with disassembl of it warhead the so call nunn lugar bill howev thi bill state that the monei mai be us onli upon receipt of convinc evid that russia will not us the materi thu made avail to produc new nuclear warhead and that the unit state will have the right to monitor the nuclear weapon dismantl process in russia wherea the first condit seem quit reason and accept the second ha clearli discriminatori overton and is unlik to be accept by russia in that form the solut might be an agreement on mutual monitor the primari argument in favor of that approach is the fact that agreement regard mutual monitor of nuclear arsen will provid a solid polit foundat upon which to strengthen the nuclear non prolifer system and get the other nuclear countri involv in the nuclear disarma process howev achiev of a comprehens agreement includ provis of complet inform on nuclear weapon arsen the full amount of fission materi produc and the process of nuclear weapon storag and destruct will requir much time and could thu have an effect on the rate of destruct therefor it would be more appropri to move toward that goal in stage by conclud a number of intermedi agreement on monitor of newli produc weapon grade plutonium on a complet halt to such product and on transfer under bilater monitor of a portion of the plutonium freed up by the process of warhead elimin at the present time both side ar conduct consult toward thi end achiev of these agreement could creat a good foundat for progress on the issu of monitor the disassembl of warhead slate for destruct and in the direct of a full scale exchang of data regard nuclear arsen on possibl solut to the issu of a russian storag facil could be to conclud a bilater russian american agreement on the transfer of surplu weapon grade plutonium in both countri to bilater or intern control under the aegi of the intern atom energi

of the nation peopl s congress financ and econom commiss idea on china s energi resourc develop strategi text energi resourc ar an indispens materi foundat for mankind s social progress and econom develop and for peopl s daili life base on the three step idea of comrad deng xiaop if we want to build china up to near the econom level of develop countri besid other condit we must have guarante of energi resourc thu on the basi of china s concret condit we must consid china s energi resourc develop strategi china s characterist ar 1 a larg popul and 2 low energi resourc consumpt level at present each person in the develop countri consum an averag of more than 5 ton of standard coal a year the unit state ha alreadi surpass 10 ton wherea china s total energi resourc consumpt in 1992 wa about 1 1 billion ton of standard coal which when divid by our popul of 1 1 billion give a per capita figur of about 1 ton of standard coal coal account for about three fourth of the energi resourc we consum if an economi is to develop and peopl s live ar to be improv then per capita energi resourc consumpt must certainli increas howev thi increas must be restrict by variou factor such as resourc and environment restrict and so on in anoth 50 to 60 year when china s economi approach the level of the develop countri our popul will have grown to about 1 5 billion at that time even if we do not attain a per capita energi resourc consumpt of 5 ton of standard coal but will onli reach 3 ton china s total energi resourc consumpt would be 4 5 billion ton of standard coal in the present situat in which china onli consum 1 1 billion ton of standard coal a year china s atmospher discharg of sulfur oxid nitrogen oxid carbon dioxid and other pollut have alreadi approach the amount discharg in the unit state the world leader it is veri hard to envisag that in sever decad china will be produc transport and burn sever billion ton of coal becaus of the seriou impact thi would have on china s economi and the atmospher and environ todai we all live on the earth which we all depend on for our exist energi resourc develop strategi and polici have now cross over nation boundari and thei can affect not just the exist and develop of the peopl of on s own countri but have a worldwid impact as well thu when we ar studi china s energi resourc develop strategi we must look at balanc demand resourc financ and other condit and we must strive to maintain equilibrium among energi resourc product and consumpt and the ecolog and environ base on thi principl i feel that besid the need to acceler the develop of convent energi resourc in the short term china s energi resourc develop strategi should focu on two area first we must adopt import measur to increas energi resourc util effici us our present 1 1 billion ton of standard coal properli and us strategi to focu on energi conserv second we must develop non pollut renew energi resourc especi hydropow bioenergi wind energi and solar energi i conserv energi resourc increas energi resourc util effici the effici of energi resourc util in china is rather low at present with an overal effici of onli about 30 percent our energi consumpt per unit gnp is 6 to 10 time higher than in the advanc countri and our energi consumpt to produc a unit of product is 50 to 100 percent higher than in foreign countri there is consider potenti for us our present energi resourc well thu conserv of energi resourc is an import nation polici of our countri and should be adher to for a long time we must establish law and regul regard energi resourc util in product and consumpt we must make conserv energi and improv energi resourc util effici an import standard for check 1 we must make macro readjust in the industri structur and product mix and energet develop those industri and product with low energi consumpt and high product valu sever larg energi produc provinc such as shanxi and heilongjiang in china s interior have energi consumpt per unit of product valu more than five time higher than econom develop provinc along the coast such as jiangsu and zhejiang and two of the main reason ar the signific differ in their industri structur and product mix 2 we must requir that newli built enterpris and restaur hospit school resid and so on conform to new energi resourc consumpt standard have special personnel to conduct energi conserv inspect of these design and not approv the construct of those that do not meet the standard we certainli cannot build those that do not conform to energi conserv standard at the time thei ar be built and that will requir technic upgrad for energi conserv after thei ar place into us ration energi consumpt standard should be formul for all new energi consum product that go into product such as water pump blower electr motor refriger televis wash machin and so on and thei should be strictli examin and we should not permit the product of those that fail to meet requir those product that ar alreadi in product should attain energi consumpt standard within a limit period of time 3 we must focu on energi conserv and reduc consumpt in all industri in the electr power industri for exampl the averag amount of coal consum to suppli electr per kwh of power from thermal power plant in 1992 in china wa 420 gram of standard coal thi wa 10 gram lower than in 1990 but it is just 320 gram in advanc countri like japan itali and other and in the former soviet union becaus thei develop a larg number of heat and power cogener plant the amount of coal consum to suppli electr is even lower just 310 gram per kwh the former ministri of energi resourc point out that the amount of coal consum to suppli electr in china s thermal power plant should be reduc from 430 gram in 1990 to 360 gram in 2000 a reduct of 70 gram at that time thermal power in china will gener 1 trillion kwh of electr so thi could conserv about 140 million ton of coal the 360 gram index is not so high as to be unattain shitongk no 2 power plant import and built by the huaneng compani ha two 600mw gener that onli consum 300 gram kwh to suppli electr if all of china attain thi level by the 2020s and project china s thermal power output then at 3 trillion kwh thi could conserv 400 million ton of coal the state should formul a seri of polici to spur energi conserv in the electr power industri the most import among them is rais depreci rate in the electr power industri to ensur that a power plant s depreci capit over 15 year is suffici to enabl it to replac it equip in addit we must strengthen power plant manag and demand energi conserv result in manag enterpris that manufactur power gener equip should continu improv design and manufactur level and reduc coal consumpt in the power gener equip thei produc to less than 300 gram within 10 to 20 year in anoth exampl develop central heat suppli and heat and power cogener is an effect wai to rais energi resourc util effici and conserv energi resourc china ha over 500 000 industri boiler and heat boiler that burn up over 400 million ton of coal a year and each year we must add small boiler with over 10 000 ton of steam output becaus the capac of these boiler is too small it is veri difficult to achiev automat coal load for burn and it is veri hard to attain the design thermal effici level of larg and medium size boiler over 90 percent the result is high energi consumpt and low thermal effici which ad to the great difficulti in carri out dust remov in small boiler also result in substanti pollut even more regrett is that becaus thei have user of heat thei alreadi had good condit for creat energi conserv and reduc coal consumpt in thermal power plant but thei have not realli been util current the thermal effici in thermal power plant is onli about 35 percent and the main reason is the presenc of unavoid cold end loss in which nearli 60 percent of the heat energi is discharg into the atmospher if thei had user of thi heat thei could recov and util these loss to suppli heat which would greatli increas the overal thermal effici thi wa what the former soviet union did implement central heat suppli can turn scatter small boiler into larg and medium size boiler which can rais automat oper level improv boiler effici and rais dust remov level have larger boiler mean higher steam paramet and the steam can first be us to gener electr and then the steam that gener the electr can be suppli to heat user which mean heat and power cogener plant calcul and actual result show that adopt thi type of upgrad measur can conserv on half of the energi resourc the state plan commiss s energi conserv invest compani ha conduct experi at sever site nationwid with substanti benefit dandongbei chemic fiber plant for exampl replac over 50 scatter small boiler with three 70 t powder coal boiler and replac nearli 30 small smokestack with a larg smokestack fit with electr dust remov and it instal two 12mw back pressur type steam turbin gener thi small cogener plant burn the coal from it former 50 plu scatter small boiler to suppli heat and gener an addit 24mw of electr and it can conserv about 50 000 ton of coal a year while at the same time solv the region s long term atmospher pollut problem expert in china and foreign countri feel that heat and power cogener is an effect energi conserv measur the unit state origin had not extend cogener but to rais energi resourc util effici dure the carter administr it formul encourag polici substanti advanc in heat and power cogener in the unit state dure the past 10 year have rais the overal effici of energi resourc util to encourag and support the larg number of scatter heat suppli small boiler china now ha in upgrad to central heat suppli and cogener plant to produc both heat and power the state should formul sever polici such as have the state provid more than on half of the loan for independ built small cogener plant in the invest per kw of instal gener capac allow the surplu power that is gener to be sold to power grid at the same price as thermal power allow small cogener plant to not particip in grid peak regul and so on in summari there is great potenti for us our exist energi resourc well and rais energi resourc util effici to conserv energi resourc abov i discuss exampl in two area but there ar mani other larg energi consum such as the metallurg industri chemic industri construct materi industri construct industri and other where there is great potenti that could be exploit in the area of rais energi resourc util effici for exampl the electr us for light in china current us larg number of incandesc light wherea new type of energi save light can conserv more than 80 percent of the electr compar to incandesc light if we us new type of electr light sourc the amount of electr that china would conserv in on year would be equival to ad 20 000mw in instal gener capac in anoth exampl the world s develop and rel develop countri all us hollow core brick in their structur which can conserv electr by 30 to 40 percent wherea china still us solid core brick for thi type of broad rang and matur energi save technolog the state should certainli make the decis to us legisl to extend them and engag in administr intervent when necessari conserv energi is a matter for all of us we must establish and rais all peopl s energi conserv conscious energi conserv should not result in inconveni in peopl s live but should instead us improv of energi resourc util effici and the establish of energi save industri an energi save economi and an energi save societi to consum the least possibl amount of energi resourc to produc the greatest possibl amount of materi wealth to make peopl s live even more conveni and attract conserv energi requir substanti capit input in the overal calcul howev the invest to conserv 1 t of standard coal is more econom than new construct the state should set asid a portion of invest from it invest in energi resourc capit construct for us in energi conserv it should also focu on energi conserv in it technic upgrad invest ii we must energet develop non pollut and renew new energi resourc 1 make a major effort to develop hydropow china ha over 600 000mw of theoret hydropow resourc reserv with 378 000mw that could be develop and us current we have develop onli 40 680mw and even though we plan to place 4 000mw into oper dure 1993 the extent of develop and util is still far from adequ thu we must acceler the pace of hydropow construct adapt to local condit and move forward with larg medium size and small hydropow station first of all there should be attract in polici to give everyon the initi to invest in develop hydropow we must speed up preparatori work acceler the pace of construct and shorten construct schedul in the manag system we must establish the correspond develop compani base on river basin such as the qing jiang develop compani and provid them with polici support such as permit the recoveri and reloan of state invest etc to enabl them to achiev roll develop 2 extend bioenergi resourc china formerli led the world in develop bioga but becaus of the effect of the small scale agricultur economi with each household build it own small pit the ga product effici is low and the intens of labor is great so thei have develop slowli holland s recent experi in build larg bioga pit on cattl farm and us heat and mix technolog can increas ga output by a factor of three and produc ga year round with the bioga be us to gener electr we should adopt advanc technolog increas the scale and mechan level of bioga construct and achiev industri product china produc over 600 million ton of crop straw each year the current direct is ammoni of straw util the vitamin and protein in the straw to rais cattl sheep and hog and us livestock wast as a bioga raw materi to produc bioga bioga product onli util the carbon and hydrogen contain in the straw while the dreg retain the nitrogen phosphoru potassium and other element in the straw thi could be an import strateg measur in develop of the rural economi and i propos that the state might as well work on straw engin there is also abund grass stalk leav organ wast and so on that can be us as raw materi for produc bioga develop new type of bioga pit is an import wai to provid energi resourc to rural area and thei can be develop by adapt to local condit in citi and township thi is a good arrang for deal with excrement and garbag in an energi save societi moreov enterpris that gener organ residu and wast liquid can establish new type of high effici bioga pit to obtain energi resourc and improv the environ anoth wai to util bioenergi is us agricultur product to produc alcohol and some countri ar now conduct experi there ar also prospect for us wood chip bagass fruit tuber and so on to produc alcohol for us as an automobil fuel 3 make major effort to develop wind energi wind energi is on of china s big advantag test done over mani year by meteorolog station indic that china ha over 400 000mw of usabl wind energi distribut mostli along the coast and in the wind energi belt run from xinjiang through inner mongolia to northeast china wind power electr gener is simpl and doe not pollut the environ it is receiv attent in a grow number of countri like the unit state england denmark holland india and other countri where it ha develop veri rapidli in recent year china ha work on small 200 to 300 w wind power gener for sever year and now ha a foundat we have now extend more than 100 000 unit which have partial solv the electr suppli problem for light and televis of grassland pastoralist with veri good result howev china s develop and util of wind energi as a proport of our energi resourc consumpt is miniscul and we should develop it quickli to gradual turn it into a forc in our energi resourc current the main problem in energet extend wind power electr gener is that the technolog for larg and medium size wind power gener in china is not matur and our equip must reli on import so manufactur cost ar high we must import internation matur technolog such as larg wind power gener with unit capac of 200 to 400 kw and organ larg batch domest product it is entir possibl to reduc the manufactur cost per unit kw to the present level for hydropow construct all countri of the world have adopt preferenti polici for develop wind energi such as tax exempt allow the electr that is gener to be suppli to grid provid electr price that permit repay of the princip and interest and so on and china should do thi too 4 develop and util solar energi solar energi is a veri clean energi resourc it can be said that china is also veri rich in solar energi china s averag annual sunshin time is more than 2 600 hour and some region such as northwest china and tibet have sunshin time of more than 3 000 hour it we us it to gener electr we could gener it for as mani hour as hydropow doe on the averag in china there is still no scientif figur for the usabl amount of solar energi that china ha but it certainli is greater than hydropow and wind energi dure the past sever year china ha made mani advanc in the area of util solar energi mainli in the area of build greenhous to produc veget and us solar energi to produc hot water but we onli have a few trial project to us solar energi to gener electr foreign countri have done a great deal of research and experiment work in recent year on util solar energi to gener electr and thei have made signific advanc and substanti reduc the cost of power gener thei have progress from monocrystallin to polycrystallin silicon and develop from polycrystallin silicon to non crystallin silicon and recent have also develop to crystal plate film and the photovolta convers effici ha risen from a few percent to over 10 percent now the total invest cost ha drop to 1 000 plu per kw as the technolog advanc develop solar power electr gener in larg amount will becom a possibl in thi field we should organ scientif research forc close track advanc step in the world and prepar to make solar energi an import forc in china s energi resourc we should also do some research and experiment work in the area of us solar energi for structur heat and suppli residenti hot water we should further improv util effici and solv the technic problem of us solar energi dure the winter 5 develop hydrogen energi and other renew energi resourc there ar huge reserv of hydrogen all countri in the world ar now do research on wai to econom produc hydrogen chemic method can be us to produc hydrogen and solar energi and surplu hydropow can be us to produc hydrogen breakthrough in thi area could provid us with clean and huge reserv of hydrogen china should also undertak research in thi area geotherm resourc ar rel abund in mani locat in china and wai to further develop and util them in a plan manner should receiv our attent there is also tidal energi wave energi and so on that can be develop and util in adapt to local condit 6 acceler the develop of nuclear power it should be said that nuclear power is also a clean energi resourc the world ha now complet 424 nuclear power reactor and the safeti problem and technolog that worri peopl have now been guarante moreov new type of nuclear power plant ar now be develop that can be made even safer in coastal region if we fail to develop nuclear power in the long term i fear that we will be unabl to solv their power suppli problem in econom develop becaus purchas nuclear power equip from foreign countri is expens the invest in the two 900mw gener at daya bai is more than 4 1 billion we will be abl to develop it on a larger scale when we can do our own manufactur nuclear power ha made progress in china in recent year but for variou reason the progress is too slow and korea which doe not have the machineri industri that china doe ha caught up with us in summari a correct energi resourc develop strategi will affect china s econom develop and affect the live of everi on of our citizen i hope that expert in thi area can all particip in research and discuss on china s energi resourc develop strategi draw on collect wisdom and absorb all us idea to form correct polici and includ them in the state s econom and social develop strategi and program so that all industri all depart and all region can implement them

high level radioact wast hlw which is of particular interest recent to the nation my own person opinion have been incorpor into thi present 2 characterist of hlw and amount gener in japan hlw refer to wast liquid that ha been separ in the process of extract uranium and plutonium in the reprocess of spent fuel in other countri howev hlw mai refer to the spent fuel itself that is in japan and franc nuclear fuel is recycl to make the most effect us of resourc but in countri such as the unit state canada and sweden hlw refer to the spent fuel itself in compar the two it is found that after process the former type of hlw is more compact and contain less radioact also in term of the period of continu radioact which depend mainli on the amount of tru transuran nuclid in the hlw the former type of hlw allow more ration control of radioact wast and is more appropri from the viewpoint of environment protect the amount of hlw gener is extrem small compar to other non specif wast if half of the electr on japanes us in a lifetim 80 year is gener by nuclear energi the amount of hlw creat in the process is about the size of three golf ball on the other hand hlw is extrem radioact becaus it contain a larg amount of fission product and it gener heat also while small in volum it includ tru nuclid with veri long half life at present the onli hlw gener in japan is at the tokai reprocess plant of the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corpor pnc and 516 cubic meter had been gener as of the end of march 1993 thi is store safe in tank at the plant furthermor japan nuclear fuel is build a commerci reprocess plant in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur and from the year 2000 hlw is expect to be gener from oper of that plant also the electr power compani current have contract with great britain and franc for spent fuel reprocess servic and the uranium and plutonium recov from the reprocess along with the hlw is to be return to japan the forecast volum of hlw that will be gener in the futur take all of these factor into consider and will be chang substanti by the reprocess plan and the scale of nuclear power gener in the futur but it is thought that the volum will be 40 000 to 50 000 vitrifi unit of hlw in the 2030s to 2040s when dispos site ar expect to be in oper consequ measur that deal with these characterist must be taken to dispos of thi volum of hlw thi mean solidifi hlw which is gener in the form of wast liquid into a safe form cool the solidifi hlw until it is in a dispos state and dispos of the hlw in a form that can be isol for a long time so that it

necessarili been clear until that point in particular the report made clear the step timet and each organ s role and share of respons for dispos as a whole as head of the offic that serv as the secretariat that compil the report i wa most keenli awar that the report had to unveil befor the japanes peopl and gain their understand and cooper for hlw dispos to do so the report had to be highli transpar and includ in concret term the polici that should be taken and the timet that should be follow to achiev appropri and safe dispos of hlw in the futur hlw dispos flow in accord with the long term plan for develop and us of nuclear energi which wa set forth by the jaec in june 1987 the step prior to implement of geolog dispos of hlw ar to proce in four phase select of effect strata phase 1 select of prospect dispos site phase 2 demonstr of dispos technolog at the prospect dispos site phase 3 and construct oper and shutdown of the dispos facil phase 4 at present we ar in phase 2 schedul

describ separ in the report to make it clear that dispos and r d ar to be advanc concurr in the futur instead of explain thing in a conceptu manner in term of the four phase we want to explain thing concret by show individu process thi will ensur that there will be no misunderstand 4 hlw dispos implement figur 3 step in hlw geolog dispos what must be consid when carri out the dispos is when where and how to carri out the dispos project industri wast gener dure industri activ normal is process and and dispos of by the parti that creat the wast in accord with the law concern wast process and cleanup which state the principl that the wast creator is respons for dispos in the case of hlw howev due to the length of time need for dispos and the safeti requir the nation govern must plai a certain role in addit to the electr power compani the wast creator thi is clearli a more activ govern respons regard industri wast than set forth in the abovement law to implement the dispos project smoothli and without confus the first thing to do is clarifi the work share of the govern and the privat sector the follow is the dispos project framework in the order given in the report 1 govern and privat sector workshar certainli the govern and privat sector must work as on in carri out the necessari measur for dispos but thi will not be effect if respons and role ar not clear the nation govern the electr power compani and pnc ar the three parti involv and the report separ their role as follow a the nation govern is respons for appropri and complet dispos and it also will draw up the polici need to advanc the dispos project smoothli b the electr power compani ar call upon to cover the cost of dispos and also to carri out a role in the r d stage that fulli reflect their respons as the hlw creator c for the present pnc will be call upon to implement steadili survei of the geolog environ and r d pnc role is easi to understand becaus it involv r d without direct involv in the dispos itself there mai be those who ar not quit sure about the relationship between the govern and the electr power compani howev and i want to supplement the abov with some of my own observ the electr power compani natur must take respons as the wast creator but as state earlier in view of the work involv in hlw dispos the long term natur of the dispos and other circumst the relationship wa set up in thi wai becaus it wa desir that in addit to the respons of the electr power compani as the wast creator the govern also bear respons for appropri and complet dispos and for draw up measur such as new legal measur and region promot measur if need to proce smoothli with the dispos project you mai be wonder exactli what appropri and complet involv i believ that thei includ the follow appropri probabl involv ensur that the form and method of dispos ar appropri and safe thu in term of form geolog dispos is state as govern polici and in term of method the govern ha indic that it polici is to carri out r d to ensur that the method us for geolog dispos ar appropri and safe and ha design pnc and the primari research organ that will take the lead in carri out the r d incident final assur of safeti probabl will be through safeti inspect by the govern complet mean that the dispos will be carri out thoroughli over what is expect to be a long period of time that is why the govern must be respons for guarante the perman of the primari implement of the dispos and for provid the system need to carri out dispos thoroughli with cooper and understand from the peopl 2 time and form of primari dispos implement it ha been customari for the wast creator itself to dispos of the wast thi is actual the case for industri wast or for the wast creator to contract a wast expert to do it howev thing ar not that simpl in the case of hlw there certainli ar no nuclear wast dispos firm nor will there be in the near futur thu an appropri primari implement must be form base on the share role of the govern and the electr power compani as point out in part 1 abov although there ar some who believ that thi primari implement should be form immedi the report take the view that right now time should be us to make steadi advanc in r d on geolog dispos and in gain the understand of the japanes peopl it maintain that take variou circumst into consider the primari implement should be form around the year 2000 the report maintain that further studi is need regard the form of the primari implement the studi should consid such requir as guarante perman dispos respons of the wast creator and applic of the result of r d the report also express the think that the time ha come to begin to realli address dispos measur and point out that it is desir for the consult committe on hlw measur promot form in octob 1992 compos of three member the govern director gener of the scienc and technolog agenc s atom energi bureau and the director gener of miti agenc of natur resourc and energi the chairman of the feder of electr power compani and the presid of pnc to begin a studi immedi on the composit of the primari implement and for a preparatori organ to be form as soon as possibl 3 establish of high level project promot preparatori committe base on the abov recommend the consult committe on hlw measur promot carri out intens studi aim at immedi format of a preparatori bodi then establish a high level project promot preparatori committe on 29 mai 1993 the preparatori committe is subordin to the consult committe and ha it own secretariat the preparatori committe will not becom the primari implement automat jaec will review the result of the preparatori committe s studi from a comprehens viewpoint and base on that the primari implement will be establish as for the administr composit of the preparatori committe jaec member hayashi wa appoint the committe chairman and there ar nine other member includ a secretari gener as of 1 juli 1993 4 step lead to dispos graphic graphic of the seri of step and procedur lead to dispos the most import and difficult probabl is select of the dispos site select is to be done by the primari implement then approv by the govern the japanes peopl probabl ar most concern about three point when will the primari implement make the select and where will it be how will the decis be made and how will the peopl be involv in the select process the report natur doe not give the name of the site which is complet undecid it doe not give a select date becaus there ar undetermin factor regard the select procedur howev the report state that the primari implement will explain the dispos project to the local govern of the area around the prospect site and get it approv emphasi is given to get prior approv from the local resid in other word the the step of govern approv of the dispos site will not be taken if local approv ha not been receiv underli thi think is the hope that thi will dispel the suspicion of the local resid which aros when the deep strata research facil to be discuss later wa site that the facil would gradual be convert into the dispos site the report state that onc the site is set the primari implement will survei the featur of the site to determin it appropri and also will valid the dispos technolog the report also give a rough timet for the dispos project with the aim of begin oper of the dispos site from the 2030s or the mid 2040s at the latest the oper commenc date wa set by assum that the primari implement will be form around the year 2000 and then consid factor such as the time need for steadi implement of the dispos step futur reprocess program and other nuclear energi develop and the fact that the vitrifi hlw return from great britain and franc will be store 30 to 50 year for cool when will the dispos site be select there ar variou undetermin factor but around 2010 to 2015 wa presum in term of the schedul given in the report 5 dispos site control japan ha chosen geolog dispos as the method for dispos of hlw as have other countri that ar proceed with nuclear energi develop the reason is that the geolog dispos concept is base on safe dispos that doe not reli on futur gener to be respons for maintain the sound of the dispos system in other word geolog dispos is a concept that doe not reli on intern systemat control to ensur safeti after the site is shut down i e the hole that ha been dug is fill back up and return to it origin state on the other hand the peopl ar veri uneasi about the fact that geolog dispos remov the hlw from human control recogn thi the report maintain that introduc the idea of a control system for monitor and maintain record after shutdown of the dispos site would be on effect wai to gain the understand of the japanes peopl that is why studi from a technolog viewpoint should continu on the signific content and timefram of a control system the word control ha variou mean when refer to hlw thi ha caus some confus which need to be straighten out on case is when control is us in the sens of perman storag either abov or below ground of vitrifi hlw some peopl think that thi is good from the viewpoint of get the understand and concurr of the peopl but the polici ha been not to us that method becaus it is not desir to burden futur gener and becaus geolog dispos which even goe as far as refil the dispos site is more appropri from the viewpoint of ensur safeti for an extrem long time a second mean is control from the time that a site for geolog dispos is open to the time it is refil the period of thi control is estim to be from 10 to 100 year the effect on the surround environ by the hlw that ha been firmli fix into underground strata can be check adequ dure that period and if there is ani problem it is even possibl to withdraw the hlw moreov sinc shutdown of the dispos site is done after a full check on whether safeti can be assur for an extrem long time it is inconceiv that troubl would aris after shutdown a third mean is control after shutdown of the dispos site thi is the control that is mention in the report the concept of geolog dispos is that safeti after shutdown of the dispos site will not depend on a control system after the shutdown thu control after shutdown is not requir to ensur safeti howev becaus there probabl ar those who feel uneasi about not have ani control after the shutdown it ha been maintain that futur studi is need on what sort of control system would be appropri in term of gain the peopl s understand at that time it will be necessari to consid the will and the attitud of the peopl and thereaft a sociolog approach will be import thu on possibl approach would be to carri out a question and answer survei 6 r d implement progress in r d creat a foundat for dispos implement and steadi implement of r d and wide knowledg about it progress is extrem import in order to gain the peopl s understand and cooper for geolog dispos furthermor sinc r d extend over a long period of time the govern must render judgment on the adequaci of r d at everi stage of new discoveri pnc ha been the primari research institut conduct r d relat to geolog dispos and last septemb it compil and publish it r d achiev in the technic report of hlw geolog dispos r d first report the major reaction of the parti involv wa that progress so far ha been good in that the r d result have clarifi the technolog base for work to be done to ensur the safeti of geolog dispos and that henceforth emphasi should be on investig research on condit in the geolog environ and if possibl data should be provid concern

the year 2000 even the time of thi report is consid veri signific and jaec will set up an evalu committe to assess it a matter of interest to mani of the concern parti is whether the result of research at the deep strata research facil can be includ in the second report no definit outlook can be given at thi time becaus it greatli depend on progress in the site of the storag engin center project pnc ha been work on thi after get an invit from horonob machi in hokkaido even if substanti progress wa to be made soon on the site and the decis to build the deep strata research facil were to be made a preliminari survei requir about two year would be necessari consid such time restraint it is doubt that much signific data could be contribut to the report nevertheless even if that data will not be readi the plan is to have measur of the artifici barrier virtual complet by that time data also can be expect from on site test be conduct in kamaishi citi iwat prefectur and the geolog dispos basic research facil in pnc tokai work that ha been oper on a full scale sinc octob 1993 thu the report will have fairli substant content 7 deep strata research facil the most import and urgent task that need to be carri out in r d concern geolog dispos from the viewpoint of dispos of vitrifi hlw is to acquir physic and chemic data on what sort of environ actual exist in the deep underground strata especi the characterist of base rock and the natur and flow of ground water to do thi a deep strata research facil need to be establish as soon as possibl advanc consider also should be given to open up the facil to all who ar interest and make it possibl for peopl to observ the actual deep strata pnc is suppos to establish thi research facil but as state earlier the storag engin center project which includ the deep strata research facil and is slate to be built in horonob machi hokkaido is oppos by the governor and legislatur of hokkaido the main reason for the opposit is the suspicion that onc the site of the storag engin center is approv the surround area automat will becom the final dispos site to dispel thi suspicion the report state clearli the govern s polici that plan of the deep strata research facil and the dispos site will be clearli separ i e the deep strata research facil will not automat becom the dispos site also as mention earlier the primari implement must get prior approv from the local resid when select the dispos site thu if the primari implement should at some point in time approach the local resid about convert the deep strata research facil into a dispos site and if thi wa reject it would be imposs to establish the dispos site there i therefor am confid that thi suspicion can be laid to rest the report also state that the geolog featur of japan make it desir to have multipl deep strata research facil the geolog featur of japan can be divid into two broad categori sedimentari rock base and crystallin rock base sinc the actual dispos site ha not be decid at least on research for each of these type of rock base must be establish the horonob area ha sedimentari rock base strata so anoth research facil must be establish in anoth area for crystallin rock base deep strata 8 cover dispos cost and region co exist the report state that in term of the principl that the wast creator should bear a fair share of the dispos cost ensur fund to cover the cost should begin at an earli date it also point out that the time ha come to estim the ration cost as soon as possibl and base on that estim draw up concret plan for ensur fund to cover the cost total cost of dispos base on estim by other countri for their dispos project probabl will be around sever trillion yen at current price when the concret cost becom clear an imag of the dispos site will be form and thi will contribut to increas the peopl s awar of the necess of the dispos undertak when address region co exist the report separ the dispos site from the deep strata research facil first with regard to the prospect dispos site the report sai that the variou survei will take a long time and will be follow by a long period of construct and oper of the dispos site and it therefor would be desir to conduct studi on how to proce with region promot in accord with the actual state of the dispos site includ system improv the report then point out that the studi should cover the creation of a new region promot system not just improv of the exist system which is base on the three principl of power resourc the report also sai that a studi of a region promot plan for the deep strata research facil is need as well and that from the viewpoint of effect us of underground space multipl us of the facil should be studi as well 9 omit 10 futur topic the govern ha work activ on the develop and us of nuclear energi but it is a fact that it ha encount all sort of critic in the cours of do so regardless of thi critic a record of safe oper of nuclear power plant ha been built and thi ha becom a part of our live until now there wa a great deal of critic about the safeti of nuclear power gener but critic recent ha focus on the nuclear fuel recycl polici and the radioact wast dispos polici it is believ that there ar two main reason for thi on is the domest reason the emphasi of nuclear energi relat undertak is shift from nuclear power gener to the nuclear fuel cycl the other is the intern reason with the breakdown of the cold war structur attent ha focus on the issu of dismantl of nuclear weapon and the extract of plutonium which ha arisen becaus of reduct of us and russian nuclear arsen and on the relat issu of pollut by nuclear weapon manufactur facil plutonium us is not the subject of thi articl so i will not go into it in detail nevertheless as long as nuclear power gener is carri out plutonium and other actinid inevit will be gener in the reactor nuclear fission of some of the plutonium take place in the reactor and as part of fuel constantli contribut to the gener of electr power the plutonium problem cannot be ignor so long as nuclear power gener is promot it is import to accept thi fact and consid how to deal with thi problem in the futur much of the recent critic about radioact wast is on hlw dispos which ha becom the focu of interest with progress on the nuclear fuel cycl undertak in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur the critic is that we should not proce with the nuclear fuel cycl undertak when there ar no clear prospect for the final hlw dispos site while it is true that the final dispos site is total undecid not on countri in the world that is pursu nuclear energi develop and us ha set up or start build a final dispos site howev it is essenti natur to clearli establish a plan of the process and step lead to construct and oper of a final site awar of the abov the report set forth a futur path base on the progress made so far on hlw countermeasur and point that have been reconsid consequ henceforth it is crucial that polici follow thi path be implement steadili specif polici that should be taken first of all ar a the high level project promot preparatori committe should carri out full scale public relat activ concern the sound and safeti of hlw dispos b steadi progress should be made on r d to ensur that geolog dispos will be sound and safe it is especi import to put maximum effort into establish the deep strata research facil at an earli date becaus it can contribut greatli not onli to advanc of r d but also to public relat activ in thi connect the storag engin center must be realiz at an earli date the content of the project can be divid into the function of temporari storag of the vitrifi hlw unit and the function of the deep strata research facil but sinc these two ar packag togeth there is concern that the center automat will becom the dispos site in the futur there also is suspicion base on a varieti of past circumst that is why a propos by the local govern of horonob machi is consid on wai to deal with the situat that is go ahead and build the deep strata research facil becaus it will be a cold plant that will not handl radioact materi but hold storag relat facil as a matter for further deliber onc even a part of the research begin mani research and technician will be assign to the area there will be a greater relationship of trust with the local resid and emot opposit aris from distrust will disappear gradual onc that happen i think that the peopl s understand can be attain regard storag relat facil as well incident anoth deep strata research facil must be set up in a crystallin rock base area effort must be made to realiz thi quickli as well also legal measur need when implement the dispos project must be consid as a medium to long term issu new legal measur have not been drawn up in order to proce with individu project such as the reprocess enterpris and low level radioact wast burial in the case of hlw dispos howev consid not onli it uniqu and difficulti but also the situat in franc the percept of most of the parti concern is that new legal measur ar need consider must be given to the fact there there is a differ in attitud and awar about law between the japanes and the peopl of franc and other western countri and care consider must be given to whether the so call method of procedur law in which site procedur ar prescrib by law would be suitabl in japan nevertheless legal statu should be given at least to such thing as the primari implement and region promot polici and legal measur in some form need to be studi 11 in conclus needless to sai a stabl suppli of energi is essenti to realiz maintain and develop comfort live condit for the peopl from the viewpoint of a stabl suppli realiz that goal must be premis on reduc as much as possibl depend on oil and increas energi demand as in text in the futur the onli wai to achiev thi is to endeavor to conserv energi and activ advanc the develop and us of reliabl altern to oil it is not realist to expect substanti amount of energi from solar and other new form of energi that is why develop and us of nuclear energi as an altern to oil is be promot as a realist polici howev it is a fact that the imag of nuclear energi which wa so bright in the earli stage of research ha fade and hold littl attract for the young scientist that will be respons for r d in the futur burnish that imag by ensur that a high level of technolog develop ha been perfect in the field of nuclear energi is a task for those of us who ar promot develop and us of nuclear energi i believ that the follow should be carri out simultan to carri out that task first we should steadili carri out the measur need for appropri dispos of hlw so that the burden is not left to futur gener second we should promot r d on a technolog aim at make resourc out of us substanc in hlw and b technolog to reduc the half life or convert tru element into non radioact nuclid by us nuclear reactor or

a few measur which ar not costli you can forget it for a gener that s veri comfort but you have no final solut the more technic argument for reprocess is the extract of plutonium although the militari

instal inspector ha block a restart of the troubl superphenix reactor which is spearhead the french fast breeder programm at the moment onli japan ha a signific fast breeder programm which give it a reason to proce with the rokkasho mura plant mr masato nakamura of the nuclear fuel divis of the atom energi bureau sai we have never consid storag in place of reprocess our view is that japan is a resourc poor nation so we have to make us of a valuabl materi an altern us for plutonium is in mix oxid fuel mox a cocktail of fuel includ plutonium which can be us in convent nuclear power station up to 25 french station could us it accord to mr gobert even so thi potenti sourc of demand for plutonium mai not justifi the expens of reprocess becaus of the larg surplu of plutonium which is build up the uranium institut a trade group estim that us and russian stockpil of plutonium amount to more than 200 tonn and of highli enrich uranium to about 1 000 tonn increasingli though the debat about reprocess turn on environment consider the critic of reprocess emphasis the danger of transport nuclear wast sometim half wai round the world to the reprocess site the radiat risk at the site itself and the fact that reprocess still leav an end product to be dispos although both bnf and cogema oper a polici of return the process wast to their client thei onli ship back high level wast becaus it is easier and safer to transport to compens for the smaller volum thei ship back slightli more high level wast than thei take in but thi still leav them with bulki low level wast to dispos of so even though neither sellafield nor la hagu is strictli a nuclear dustbin where foreign client can dump their nuclear rubbish and forget about it both site have to store consider amount of wast mr gobert reject the accus that the act of reprocess actual add to the wast he sai that up3 the newest facil at la hagu produc no more wast than direct dispos and we know we can do better than that mr guin sai what we ar do is social desir we ar also make quit a lot of monei take the longer view our children will be mighti grate that we have taken thi cours howev both the uk and franc do have to have final storag site for the end product of reprocess in the uk thi is the respons of nirex a compani jointli own by the govern and the nuclear industri which is try to obtain permiss for a deep underground site next to sellafield despit the misgiv about reprocess it is unlik that their state owner will take a neg view of sellafield and la hagu both plant have been financ with monei from their client so thei place no burden on state budget and their bulg order book promis healthi export earn for mani year both compani make profit although the adequaci of their return will not be fulli test until their new plant can show their pace if thei ar commerci success their owner could invit in privat investor in the long term context in which the nuclear industri like to see itself it mai be mislead to see the debat in term of storag repres an altern to reprocess at the moment world reprocess capac amount to about 4 000 tonn a year accord to the intern atom energi agenc howev the amount of spent fuel discharg each year is about 9 000 tonn although reprocess capac is expect to rise to 6 800 tonn by the year 2000 spent fuel discharg will still exce thi far from clear up the backlog the

which burn coal or those which burn orimuls the bitumen base fuel import from venezuela and whether thei hasten the so call dash for ga fire gener in the late 1980s mr margaret thatcher then the prime minist appear to commit the uk to build some 12 000mw of fgd but there seem littl prospect of that now there ar even doubt aboutwheth the 8 000mw indic by the govern for england and wale at electr

import and by build combin cycl ga station ga ha undoubt environment advantag over coal it emit about half the carbon dioxid per unit of electr and virtual no sulphur dioxid what infuri the coal lobbi is that the new ga plant will replac coal station which could have year of us life left and could in some case be even cheaper to run when fit with fgd the coal lobbi s explan for the dash for ga is that region electr compani becam involv in joint ventur to set up new gener compani becaus thei were desper to escap the clutch of a duopoli in powergen and nation power which charg them more than necessari for power these new compani had a captiv market in the region electr compani through long term contract which allow cost to be pass on to custom nation power and powergen respond the argument goe by build their own ga fire station so that thei could retain market share the coal lobbi s conclus is that the dash for ga is the result of a flaw market which will result in a wast of uk energi resourc and pit closur which will close off coal suppli for ever the gener respons is that it make more sens to invest in ga fire gener which is more environment friendli and more thermal effici than to retrofit fgd on to plant which ha limit life the counter argument ar unlik to convinc the gener to build anyth more than drax ratcliff and possibl ferrybridg and anoth plant at

the bn 600 ha run safe and effici at beloyarsk sinc 1981 last year it avail rate wa 80 6 per cent consider better than the 76 per cent achiev by russia s nuclear plant as a whole i believ the fast

engin have re design the bn 800 the origin design produc 30 per cent more plutonium than it burnt kochetkov sai but the final design ha a breed ratio of about on that mean the amount of plutonium built up will be no more than the amount burnt we could continu that process to cater for public percept of the danger of nuclear prolifer so that the reactor consum more plutonium than it produc anoth wai of dispos of surplu plutonium which is more popular in the west than burn it in fast reactor is to combin it with uranium and burn the result mix oxid fuel or mox in pwr ipp is put the final touch to a new facil to test mox fuel element but kochetkov doe not hide hi reluct to go down the mox road the ipp director believ it is more profit to us the plutonium in fast reactor outsid observ believ the russian nuclear expans programm as a whole is far too grandios to be practic russia itself could not possibl rais intern the ten of billion of dollar that would be requir to carri out the

most success solar power produc lo angel luz intern it s realli pick up sinc aug 2 there is no doubt that the iraqi invas and the subsequ energi crisi have focus new public attent on renew energi technolog such as solar wind geotherm biomass and hydroelectr that gener electr without the environment side effect of most fossil fuel but although produc of renew energi ar grate for the new attent mani ar irrit that the public still think renew energi is onli a dream for the futur it s out there alreadi flanigan sai and it doe work despit sharp cutback in feder research and tax support for renew energi technolog most of them have left the laboratori and ar out in the field gener electr nationwid 5 of current product of electr and on third of all new power capac instal sinc 1985 ha come from solar wind geotherm and biomass facil in california a full 12 of the state s electr need ar alreadi provid by these sourc all the same although industri advoc and produc ar proud of their progress in the past few year thei point to technolog govern and busi challeng that will confront each of the new technolog in the come decad solar solar technolog can gener be divid into two group solar thermal system which us sunlight to heat water or other fluid and photovolta technolog that convert the sun s light directli into electr in the 1980s solar thermal technolog made the leap from small modular unit design to heat individu build to larg commerci electr gener system luz intern ha had the greatest success with such system us acr of concav mirror in the mojav desert to heat a special conduct fluid that then superheat water to spin steam turbin luz suppli a total of 354 megawatt of power to southern california edison enough electr to meet the need of half a million residenti custom as it unveil a new 80 megawatt plant last month luz report that it cost have fallen from 24 cent per kilowatt hour in 1984 to 8 cent todai a price that is becom competit with ga oil and nuclear power which cost between 3 and 7 cent per kilowatt hour but although solar thermal power ha enjoi some commerci success it repres onli about 0 1 of us electr consumpt and is not expect to climb much higher expert agre that the real advanc for solar power will come in the second area of solar technolog photovolta photovolta technolog us mirror to concentr photon of sunlight onto silicon cell the impact of the photon shake loos silicon electron whose movement gener electr current although the cost of photovolta ha fallen from 1 50 to 30 cent per kilowatt hour over the last decad photovolta system remain much more costli than other energi sourc still photovolta technolog is so promis that the govern is concentr most of it solar research dollar on it but solar share a problem with other renew energi system although thei ar usual cheap to oper thei ar expens to build thi is becaus the resourc sunlight subterranean water wind cost almost noth but the high tech facil that chang them into electr ar expens facil that us fossil fuel on the other hand ar cheap to build but requir a continu suppli of costli oil ga or coal wind wind energi got an undeservedli bad name in the 1970s propon insist as investor rush to take advantag of the tax shelter the feder govern offer for renew mani project were rush to complet the technolog simpli wasn t readi sai randal swisher presid of the washington base american wind energi assn we move wind into manufactur too rapidli but in the mid 1980s after make small but crucial improv such as wash the turbin blade period to remov insect the industri got back on it feet now california s 15 000 wind turbin oper reliabl enough to provid 1 500 megawatt of power to the state enough to suppli the residenti need of the citi of san francisco as with solar the come challeng for wind power ar not primarili technolog but commerci in 10 to 20 year swisher estim wind power could go from suppli 0 2 of the nation s electr need to a full 10 but tom besich power contract manag for southern california edison sai that despit it competit cost about 7 cent per kilowatt hour wind is unlik to get much larger in part becaus resid find the turbin unsightli and in part becaus the power sourc is not suffici reliabl the problem is that wind isn t predict the wind just doesn t blow when you need it geotherm geotherm technolog which us the heat of the earth s molten core to gener electr ar also oper commerci in california the largest system is at the geyser a sprawl facil 90 mile north of san francisco in sonoma and lake counti that gener 1 350 megawatt of electr for pacif ga electr it is the second largest sourc of renew energi for california and the cheapest it cost pg e onli 2 1 2 cent per kilowatt hour far less than the 6 to 8 cent it cost for natur ga or oil but geotherm still suppli less than 0 3 of the nation s electr power and is not expect to grow much more on reason is that there ar not mani region of the countri where the earth biomass technolog that fall into thi categori ar a hodgepodg rang from plant that burn wood agricultur and municip wast to high tech facil that gasifi shrub some built on top of landfil creat electr from the methan ga that rise off buri garbag taken togeth biomass technolog form the largest sourc of renew energi in the unit state a full 5 of nation electr us but environmentalist have mix feel about biomass becaus it is base on combust the same process that gener heat from coal ga and oil it creat more pollut than other sourc of renew energi hydroelectr hydroelectr power remain the oldest sourc of electr from renew energi in the unit state and is a close second to biomass in nation output suppli about 4 8 of us energi need it is also on of the cheapest sourc of electr cost about 2 cent per kilowatt hour but hydroelectr power gener ha fallen out of favor in recent year particularli among environmentalist mani ar concern about disrupt local fish migrat and caus eros the energi depart sai more than 180 hydroelectr project will come up for relicens in the next five year and offici expect opposit from resid who would prefer to return dam area to their natur state nonetheless the depart sai onli 5 of the dam in the unit state ar us for power gener and mani more could be tap for energi without increas environment risk to the surround area
