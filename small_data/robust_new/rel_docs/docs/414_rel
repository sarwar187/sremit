that we need these product in the ussr we produc about 8 to 9 million ton of sugar a year and have to bui 4 million ton from cuba to make up the shortfal the signific to us of the cuban sugar is consider nickel is vital for our industri and cuba s citru fruit ar veri import to us but he hint at harder bargain by a soviet deleg now in havana to begin negoti new trade term to replac the five year cooper agreement that expir at the end of thi year becaus of the us of barter and overvalu rubl and cuban peso it is hard to calcul the extent of the soviet subsidi to the castro regim but expert sai the soviet pai more than twice the world price for cuban sugar and similarli unrealist price for raw materi and citru fruit thu cuba mai soon be get less nourish from the soviet than it ha in the
