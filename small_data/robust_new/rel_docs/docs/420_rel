of the criteria describ abov as requir by epcra section 313 d 3 thu the criteria for list or delist a chemic ar ident howev wherea epa can add a chemic if onli on of the criteria is met it can onli delet a chemic if none of the criteria ar met to ascertain whether there is suffici or insuffici evid to determin that the statutori criteria ar met for list a chemic epa conduct a hazard assess on the chemic and determin base on the weight of the evid whether the chemic can reason be anticip to caus ani of the advers effect specifi in epcra section 313 d 2 the hazard analysi is describ abov in unit ii b 3 of thi preambl epa interpret of the specif statutori criteria follow 1 section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect to determin whether the section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect criterion is met epa must examin the advers effect associ with the chemic the concentr level which would caus acut human health effect and the likelihood of such level exist beyond facil site boundari as a result of continu or frequent recur releas such a determin mai includ among other factor consider of product process workplac procedur pollut control and the volum and pattern of product us and releas as well as other chemic specif factor epa believ that to make the section 313 d 2 a determin it must demonstr that a chemic can reason be anticip to be releas in quantiti that result in concentr level or within a reason margin of exposur of the concentr level that would be expect to caus acut human health effect beyond the facil site boundari the margin of exposur appli is depend upon the type of hazard data e g data in anim versu human and the confid in thi hazard data base for acut effect e g suffici of the hazard data howev epa is not requir to make a facil specif find nor is it necessari for epa to demonstr that these concentr level or effect occur at or near ani particular facil ref 1 furthermor epa mai but is not requir to conduct new studi or risk assess or perform site specif analys to establish actual ambient concentr or to document advers effect at ani particular locat ref 1 nor is epa limit to consid concentr level and potenti acut human health effect at the fencelin rather the phrase beyond facil site boundari reflect congress recognit that the highest concentr to which person outsid the site boundari mai be expos could occur at ani point outsid the boundari of the site on which the facil is locat includ for exampl where an air emiss plume cool and settl to the ground ref 1 therefor epa believ that to make a find under epcra section 313 d 2 a the agenc mai estim concentr at or beyond the facil site boundari through the us of estim releas and model techniqu the term continu or frequent recur releas is includ onli to distinguish routin releas that ar a normal consequ of the oper of a facil from the episod and accident releas that ar subject to epcra section 304 ref 1 as such epa believ that episod and accident releas ar not pertin in a determin that a chemic meet the section 313 d 2 a criterion 2 section 313 d 2 b chronic human health effect in contrast to the section 313 d 2 a criterion section 313 d 2 b doe not requir consider of either the natur and frequenc of releas or concentr level at facil site boundari rather section 313 d 2 b is focus sole on whether the chemic is known or can reason be anticip to caus cancer teratogen or other seriou or irrevers chronic human health effect consequ epa believ that it is suffici to consid onli the toxic of the subject chemic to make the section 313 d 2 b determin 3 section 313 d 2 c environment effect the section 313 d 2 c criterion requir epa to consid a chemic s potenti to caus signific advers effect on the environ the statut direct epa to base it determin on a consider of the toxic of the chemic either alon or in combin with the persist of the chemic or the potenti for the chemic to bioaccumul congress intend that epa consid a broad rang of environment effect when make a determin under section 313 d 2 c in determin what constitut a signific advers effect on the environ the administr should consid the extent to which the toxic chemic caus or can reason be anticip to

believ that the environment effect criterion inher contain a limit exposur compon becaus of the statutori requir for epa to find a signific advers effect on the environ of suffici serious in the judgment of the administr to warrant report under epcra section 313 unlik section 313 d 2 b where epa onli ha to determin whether certain kind of effect ar known or reason anticip to occur section 313 d 2 c requir epa to find the effect to be of suffici serious to warrant report which impli the possibl that under certain circumst a chemic that could theoret caus a signific advers effect on the environ is unlik to caus on of a magnitud to warrant list the extent to which exposur is factor into epa determin depend upon the inher toxic of a chemic and a varieti of other chemic specif characterist epa believ that when a chemic is inher extrem toxic that is it is toxic at veri low dose level an exposur assess is not necessari becaus even minim releas of such a chemic mai reason be anticip to result in signific advers environment effect in such case epa could reli on toxic alon under section 313 d 2 c i as a basi for list howev for chemic that exhibit advers effect upon the environ sole base on toxic at moder low dose epa believ that consider of potenti exposur is warrant becaus minim releas mai not result in signific advers effect upon the environ these exposur consider mai includ among other factor pollut control the volum and pattern of product us and releas environment fate as well as other chemic specif factor and the us of estim releas and model techniqu epcra section 313 d 2 c ii and iii allow epa to consid the impact of other characterist of a chemic where a chemic exhibit signific advers effect in the environ base on toxic and persist or toxic and bioaccumul at veri low to moder low dose level epa believ that exposur consider ar not requir in addit to those consider implicit in evalu of the chemic s potenti for persist and bioaccumul thi is becaus even minim releas of the chemic mai result in elev concentr in the environ or in an organ that can reason be anticip to result in signific advers effect thi reflect the increas likelihood that there will be exposur to a chemic that persist due to it longer resid time in the environ repeat minim releas of a persist chemic mai result in elev concentr in the environ for a chemic that
