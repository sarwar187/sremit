that socker presid ron cadi sai i ve seen x rai of hi hip and how he still plai is a marvel beyond my wildest dream becaus the team ha heal from earli season injuri socker coach ron newman sai he doesn t have a place for zungul in the first two start posit zungul and newman had a meet on the dalla trip in decemb newman said zungul told him he would prefer not to suit up if he wasn t among the top two zungul wasn t will to be us as a util player newman oblig so now it appear zungul is closer than ever to depart from the familiar world of the kick industri what s next anybodi s guess is probabl as good as zungul s and that could explain why he won t discuss about hi thought plan or feel there mai be anoth reason he never realli had to talk about himself said branko segota a teammat and close friend he wa alwai the point leader and he wa a leader so he didn t realli have to sai anyth becaus he wa alwai at the top wai at the top he ha collect 764 goal in the major indoor soccer leagu alon add to that 63 goal from the north american soccer leagu and anoth 250 when he plai with the hajduk split a profession team in yugoslavia and that give him well over 1 000 forget all the nifti goal he must have score in street game as a kid for hi achiev he ha been dub the lord of all indoor and larg becaus of hi stori reput the socker decid after much deliber between newman and cadi that it would be worth their while and their 25 000 the misl minimum salari to bring zungul out of retir last season when no other team want him it prove to be smart he score 42 point in 37 regular season game 17 in 14 playoff game and plai a signific role in the socker seventh championship thi season the cast ha chang gone ar midfield paul dougherti and chri chueden and defend alan willei all of whom made the socker more defens orient last season newcom damir haramina we wade and jim gabarra ar all forward and thei re forward of the futur that leav zungul out so there ha been talk of a rift between newman and zungul who have never been the best of buddi anywai newman ha tri to figur out where to place zungul becaus of their rocki relationship zungul wa not and probabl will not be consid for assist coach posit i think it s been pretti well state that steve and ron don t go out to dinner everi night cadi said but i think thei have mutual respect for each other either wai newman insist he ha noth against zungul it s not a person vendetta he sai i ve never had a person vendetta i m just pure try to pick the best team for the job i don t care where thei ar who thei ar what thei ve done steve is a player who still ha to work to get a spot when everybodi s fit and all the forward ar fit he s still got to fight for that posit like anybodi els but we ar talk about a legend that s not my problem newman sai i can t plai player on the strength of their clip book segota still think zungul ha a clip or two left in him i don t think he s been given a fair chanc to plai segota sai if steve wa in there in kei area of the field sometim i think he can make thing happen he s still got the knack to score and hi pass is still there even segota will admit though that the rest of the player need to work a littl harder when zungul is on cover for him on defens certainli zungul is not in the shape he wa sever year ago or even at the end of last season and he ha never had the reput for tackl physic train with a great deal of zest there is alwai the question of whether or not it wa in zungul s best interest to return thi season ron fowler the socker owner said he and cadi decid that zungul s contribut last season should be acknowledg so thei gave him a posit on thi year s team there ha been talk that fowler brought zungul back to make a big public splash by retir him at the misl all star game feb 22 to that fowler respond there s absolut no truth to us try to make a buck off steve we want to bring him back we felt especi dure the playoff he wa a posit influenc and a signific contributor newman s view is slightli differ we can t guarante him anoth championship he sai that wa an ideal time for him to sai thank you well done and go out in glori becaus he wa veri much an import part of the histori of thi leagu fowler said he zungul and cadi reach an agreement that if zungul didn t feel a burn desir to plai at ani time dure the season he would alert them sinc then zungul ha met sever time with fowler and cadi express a displeasur at hi lack of plai time fowler and cadi both sai thei will not interfer with newman s decis we were not go to dictat what hi role wa go to be fowler said that wa up to the coach i think he feel he should be plai but ron newman is the coach of the team and he is the onli on who is go to decid who is go to plai and who is not go to plai i think steve would like to have us step in i ve offer to have a meet with the two ron steve at thi stage ha chosen not to have the meet mondai night newman said he call zungul and ask him to go on the trip to st loui where the socker plai wednesdai zungul told him he didn t think he wa quit fit yet it wa veri pleasant actual newman said i told him i didn t have a vendetta against him i said let s don t becom enemi i want steve to retir without damag to hi reput it mai take the remaind the season to fulli determin if that is feasibl there ar reason zungul mai still figur into the socker plan coincid or not the socker ar 7 3 in game zungul ha plai 3 9 without him fowler said he is well awar of that statist and ha given newman a specif date by which he want to see the socker win on a more regular basi after that there will be chang plai zungul is on possibl a trade is anoth injuri down the stretch might allow zungul plai time and it would be hard to argu that he isn t a bad gui to have around as playoff draw near he can help defend kevin crow said he s got the experi if you re go to have a 17th or 18th man who better than steve especi dure crunch time he did it last year he s abl to lift it for short period of time he might be abl to do it on more time but then that will be it thi is definit zungul s last season as a player he ha said so the socker have said so after that he will face a new world on that hasn t alwai been kind to former soccer superstar as he stood on the sidelin dure a socker practic dure preseason zungul wa ask about kaz deyna the former score wizard who wa kill in an automobil crash thi past summer friend of deyna said he hadn t been the same sinc retir hi blood alcohol level wa twice the legal limit at the time of the accid zungul spoke of the import of misl organ assist player in make the segu from soccer to everydai life thi is not an easi transit for someon who is us to the applaus the autograph seeker the trophi and the slap on the back you ar suddenli someon who blend rather than someon who stir not dress in jean dress in a jacket zungul said an adult not an entertain anymor you ar an ordinari man just like everybodi els that can be a littl scari it s a veri uncomfort situat for steve fowler sai it s veri uncomfort for the team that s life no on said life would be fair
