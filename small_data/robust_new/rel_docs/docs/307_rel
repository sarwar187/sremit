2 discuss on the select of individu unit capac for the three gorg hydropow station the current plan select a 680 000 kw gener the major advantag is that it can be manufactur domest the disadvantag is that it capac is too low and the total instal capac is also too low the author believ that a gener should be select base on a layout that suit the optim instal capac we should also choos a plan that emploi the most technolog advanc econom feasibl unit that would maxim the total instal capac we ar build the largest hydropow plant in the world and we ar plan to instal unit at the level of the 1970s moreov it is even lower than the individu capac at the grand coule and itaipu thi is wai out of the ordinari we ar stress the fact that we want to be self suffici we need to liber our think and chang our concept the select of individu unit capac need to be revalid base on a socialist market economi gener that ar go to be instal over a dozen year down the road ought to be a product of the 21st

author recommend two differ plan for the individu unit capac the first on is plan 2 where the turbin diamet is a non standard valu of 9 85 m the output of the turbin is 729 mw and the gener unit produc 700 mw thi plan ensur that the individu unit capac at the three gorg is equal to that at two exist famou power plant i e the itaipu at the brazil paraguai border and the grand coule dam in the unit state the number of unit remain unchang and the layout doe not need to be alter the total instal capac is 700mw x 26 18 200mw which is 520 000 kw higher than that in the valid plan second is plan 5 the turbin diamet is d1 10 40 m the turbin output is 824 700 kw and the gener unit output is 800 000 kw becaus the plan requir the us of a 13 5 m diamet pressur steel pipe the center distanc between unit is increas by 3 m in order to keep the flood gate and ship lock in their origin posit the north and south plant need to reduc the number of unit by on each i e 13 unit in the north and 11 in the south the total number is 24 and the overal instal capac is 800mw x 24 19 200mw it is 1 52mw larger than that in the valid plan a station of the same length can accommod 22 0 9mw unit with a total instal capac of 19 8 million kw or 20 1mw unit with a total instal capac of 20 million kw it is obviou that instal 0 8mw unit is the most effect wai to rais the overal instal capac by the end of thi centuri china should have the capabl to manufactur 800mw gener unit it is also possibl to jointli design and manufactur with foreign firm as in the case of the geheyan hydropow station it also mai be possibl to solicit intern bid for some of the unit 3 conclus the three gorg hydropow station must take the compens and regul effect of the hydropow station upstream 30 year from now into account it must take full advantag of it locat at the center of nation power grid and gener as much power for peak shave as possibl it should have the maximum instal capac possibl to enhanc it peak shave capabl it is recommend that 24 gener unit with an individu unit capac of 800mw be place sinc there is essenti no chang in plant length and locat there will be minim chang to the water flow downstream the diamet of the steel pipe is increas by 10 percent to 13 5 m the increas in difficulti to manufactur should be easi to handl our hydropow expert scholar and colleagu should revalid the individu unit capac and unit number base on the new socialist market economi there is still time to chang the design despit the fact that two 170 000 kw unit were successfulli test at the erjiang station of gezhouba the dajiang station refus to us it instead it is still us the smaller 125 000 kw unit the consequ ar that it is wast water 100 dai a year hopefulli thi will not happen at the three gorg the plan to instal 24 800mw unit at the three gorg is of vital import

we must stick to a basic construct process despit the fact that our economi is grow at a fast pace and the depth of reform is get deeper prepar of a hydropow plan report is an import stage it determin the scope phase and sequenc select of first stage work of the develop effort it is the foundat requir for a feasibl studi of everi hydropow station we must do a good job to prepar a hydropow plan report for the middl and lower reach of the jinsha jiang 2 studi major technoeconom issu in depth the jinsha jiang is china s largest hydropow base we must rigor perform the front end prepar work and

to thi end the author ha the follow suggest 1 stronger govern leadership develop of the jinsha jiang is a strateg project that will have a signific impact on the economi it should be treat as seriou as the project to divert water to the north from the south under the guidanc of the state plan commiss and the ministri of electr power industri a jinsha jiang develop offic should be establish to studi major polici issu such as hydropow develop scheme capit rais approach electr price polici right and benefit relat to provinc that own the resourc and those that consum power plu power station ownership and distribut of benefit of hydropow station border two or more provinc and shoulder invest for overal util and provid it find to the govern in the decis make process 2 expand public in order to acceler the jinsha jiang the project should be more aggress promot through a varieti of channel by differ mean to make more peopl in more depart and industri awar of the signific of build a hydropow energi base in the southwest to allow the appropri author and depart to adopt the necessari econom legal and administr measur to help implement and support thi project thi will bring more organ and more peopl to support the develop of hydropow along the jinsha jiang 3 secur earli stage fund the scale of the project to build the jinsha jiang hydropow station is enorm there will be a great deal of work at the front end for a consider period of time if construct is to begin in the year 2000 earli stage work should start now otherwis it will be too late it will serious impact the develop effort to acceler the develop of the jinsha jiang the focu now is to begin earli stage plan work of kei hydropow station and site along the river to speed up thi earli stage work we need to increas the level of fund the plan and design academi is veri much concern about the earli stage work for the jinsha jiang project and ha schedul sever design unit to get involv in the earli stage work on the river section and hydropow station at xiangjiaba and xiluodu nevertheless progress is hamper due to a sever shortag of fund to solv thi problem a special request wa submit to the state plan commiss the ministri of electr power industri and the nation energi resourc invest corpor in addit base on the principl of a market economi the author should negoti with the electr util in central eastern and southern china to invest in the project for futur consumpt in order to rais monei to cover the front end work and the construct cost furthermor the suggest that the three gorg develop corpor invest in the jinsha jiang project should also be follow up and nail down upon complet of the three gorg project it is a natur for the cooper to immedi develop the jinsha jiang if thi suggest is accept earli stage fund will be secur and ownership of the project will be clear it will further facilit the progress of earli stage work under the premis of increas fund through strengthen leadership and coordin requir on qualiti and progress can be further defin differ task can then be assign and variou unit can rel quickli produc qualiti plan design report if fund cannot be increas then all our effort on proof of concept and scheme will be in vain 4 speed up the plan report thi report should includ detail such as voltag of eastbound electr stage develop plan and develop sequenc it should be offici review by the govern to serv as the basi for the design of variou stage of hydropow station it should be point out that an approv river hydropow plan report is a necess to attract capit from other provinc and countri develop of the jinsha jiang is a monument task that is go to take place between thi and the next centuri as long as the govern provid stronger leadership increas the level of fund for earli stage work reli on scienc and technolog take control over plan and design formul appropri polici and obei the principl of a socialist market economi in rais construct capit there is a possibl that the jinsha jiang hydropow base project mai start in 2000 by 2010 electr will be transmit eastward the jinsha jiang hydropow base will be complet by 2040

with the final approv of deng xiaop li peng and other to serv the need of put polit in command of everyth for the parti cultur the propos to develop the three gorg project is actual aim at set peopl s mind at rest and divert their discont with what happen after the 4 june incid thi project is destin to end up in three disastr wai china is determin to develop the three gorg project the resettl of the peopl in the 13 counti along the chiang jiang ha alreadi begun i cannot sai much about thi project sinc i am not an expert in water conserv and i have been driven out of the countri nevertheless i am quit familiar with the cpc parti cultur of score of year the process from the earli evalu to the final decis in develop the three gorg project precis show a vivid sampl about the influenc of the parti cultur there ar mani thing that make peopl indign and heav a deep sigh i would like to inform my fellow countrymen about them in thi articl know the present by review the past dure the 40 year when the communist parti of china rule the countri all parti leader invari love to develop larg project and exagger there ar some well known exampl from the mao era such as steel make in backyard overtak britain in 15 year and realiz commun after three year the practic of everyon eat from the same big pot which mean commun wa propos in 1958 also there wa the sanmen gorg water conserv project along the yellow river the parti order the project becaus it want to make the water in the yellow river clear with chairman mao s hand so that the prophesi that when a sage emerg the water in the yellow river becom clear left from the ancient time would be fulfil by chairman mao at that time the whole parti regard the develop of the sanmen gorg dam as a polit task of top prioriti howev the yellow river is still fill with murki water todai when the sage ha alreadi been dead for more than 10 year the sanmen gorg clog with silt ha becom a cynic mockeri of the greatest sage in the world fantasi mao s successor hua guofeng realiz that it wa hard for him to exercis leadership becaus he lack polit capit he sought to score more econom achiev to make up for hi polit weak thu he made magnific plan to build ten enterpris such as the baotou iron and steel complex and anoth ten oil field such as the daqe oil field later hi mistak wa seiz by deng xiaop who sneer and call it a foreign leap forward later hua guofeng wa kick out of the polit bureau togeth with hi bold remark the chines communist leader love to talk and act big but not becaus thei ar conceit or thei have the person tempera of love to brag the project thei choos to develop ar not realli conduc to the nation economi or the peopl s livelihood thei ar aim at heighten or consolid their polit author thi is the purpos of put polit in command of everyth deng xiaop critic hua guofeng for promot the foreign leap forward but he himself cannot jump out of the eccentr ring of histori if polit leader ar elect by the peopl thei must pai full attent to the will of the peopl and the tenur of their offic is limit thei would not commit such error thi is the first main point of the parti cultur rais a hue and cry on the mass media and win warm applaus from the peopl is half wai to success for the chines communist thei attach great import to propaganda work thei do not take into consider in advanc the difficulti thei mai encount as well as the consequ deng xiaop s suggest to cross a river by feel the stone is a brief outlin of thi mode of think therefor most of china s project in econom construct have a fine start but poor finish there ar some project where a great deal is said but no action is taken in some case thei cannot find the stone while in other case thei have not got into the water yet the aforement is the second main point of parti cultur in econom construct the three gorg project for hydroelectr power gener wa veto when mao zedong and zhou enlai were in power why doe thi project resurfac again after 1989 we ar abl to understand the situat better if we studi the first and second main point of the parti cultur deng xiaop li peng zou jiahua and other have made the final decis to develop the three gorg project under thi kind of histor background becaus thei need to serv the need to put polit in command of everyth as far as 1989 is concern the chines communist leadership regard it as a bad year the 4 june butcheri wa follow by the collaps of the soviet union and eastern europ face with troubl at home and abroad the chines communist found themselv isol and helpless as never befor it wa at such a time that thei propos develop the three gorg project on the surfac thei claim that power shortag were the roadblock in increas product and deepen reform quot zou jiahua s word but actual the project is aim at set the peopl mind at rest and divert them from their discont with realiti thi mental of sing a grand beij opera for the peopl is similar to that of work hard to host the 2000 olymp game in beij refer to zou jiahua s remark i said at a gather held in the silicon vallei near san francisco on 15 august 1992 that the chines communist hope to extric themselv from their predica by develop the chang jiang water conserv project the result will invari be a suicid polici bring calam to the countri and the peopl actual china is not short of electr power power shortag problem can be solv by adopt other measur what china need badli is democraci and human right local newspap have carri report on my speech understand the present to better predict the futur those at the top act arbitrarili and turn a deaf ear to all neg view to meet requir in accord with the second main point of parti cultur it is necessari to mobil the whole parti to ensur that public opinion from the top to the bottom throughout china is in conform with the parti central committe all those with differ polit view ar crimin and enemi first of all a leader set up a plan at a meet deng xiaop alwai make the final decis then he mobil a group of expert to rig up all the argument to prove the brillianc and correct of the parti central committe there wa a water conserv expert at the qinghua univers professor huang wanli 7806 8001 6849 prior to the develop of the yellow river sanmen gorg dam dure the mao era he wrote a letter to the govern organ in charg of the project to oppos the develop of the project for thi he wa label a rightist and depriv of hi right to speak a campaign wa whip up in the 1990 s to develop the major chang jiang water conserv project huang onc again wrote a letter to voic hi opposit he wa turn down he sought to go through legal proceed against the project natur he wa total ignor anoth water conserv expert wrote a letter suggest build five to six medium hydroelectr power station in differ locat along the tributari of the chang jiang which would be abl to gener electr within five year the greatest advantag of thi project is that all place of histor interest and scenic beauti would remain intact while improv navig along the chang jiang is insur thi plan wa reject by li peng and other who love to talk and act big thei held that the disadvantag of the plan is that it cannot solv all the problem at on fell swoop nor can it demonstr the superior of social here we have onc again run into the parti cultur roadblock to ensur uniform in all mass media throughout the countri all newspap and journal ar forbidden to print ani opposit view thei also ar not allow to print letter from reader who question the project when expert and hong kong report conduct on site inspect tour thei were invari brief in advanc about the project and the tremend achiev after the complet of the project we cannot but admir the painstak effort made by those who advoc the project thei fear that the hong kong new media would differ with the parti central committe in opinion when the 1992 nation peopl s congress npc wa prepar to adopt the motion on the three gorg project a scale model of the project wa put on displai outsid of the confer hall and the chines communist leadership whip up a frenzi insid and outsid of the congress for the project thei did not expect that on third of the deputi would still vote against the project or abstain thi wa the first time in the histori of the npc that it role as a rubber stamp wa overshadow on of the npc stand committe member huang shunx held a press confer sai that there ar more disadvantag than advantag in develop the three gorg project he also said that the chines communist offici made him angri by exert pressur on the npc deputi natur newspap did not report on what he had said later the chines communist expel huang shunx from the npc without make him lose hi face from thi we can see that the entir process in the develop of the three gorg project is soak with the poison juic of the parti cultur the parti cultur is a product which combin autocraci with class struggl it sharpli conflict with ani effort to make polici decis with a democrat and scientif approach the three gorg project is on of system engin which goe beyond the centuri a dam with the highest elev of 175 meter in the world falsehood and subjectiv have no place in ani scientif undertak in addit most of the peopl work on the project ar laymen or cadr who blindli follow order right now the qualiti of the cadr ar much wors than those who built the sanmen gorg dam dure the mao era when a vice minist of water conserv and the chief respons person of the corpor in the develop of the three gorg project assum hi post he said we plan to cut short the time to dam the river by on year so that it will happen at the same time as the return to china of sovereignti over hong kong the year 1997 will be a year of doubl celebr i hope that comrad in the depart carri out preparatori work for the project will work conscienti and boldli even if thei make mistak i will natur assum the respons he ad we like to ask a question why is it necessari to drag togeth the occas of dam the chang jiang and the return of hong kong s sovereignti to china the author in beij ar think about recov hong kong ahead of schedul doe thi mean that the date for dam the chang jiang will also be move up so that it will happen in the same year as hong kong s return to china besid peopl in hong kong do not feel that 1997 is a year for celebr in the year of doubl celebr for what do we celebr dure the past dozen of year china had alwai select 1 juli or 1 octob to start or finish ani construct project or to launch a new ship as a sign to make contribut to the parti to complet a project or launch a new ship on a certain date worker have been ask to hurri up and work overtim at the sacrific of qualiti as a result such practic often caus landslid major

s lack of influenti social subject independ of the parti and state made it paternalist function develop the state attempt to protect it subject from it own part as soon as the ecolog problem began to be recogn by the offici commun and that happen dure the thaw of 1953 1964 the parti and the state took some step to increas control over certain violat of ecolog standard abov all by privat citizen social activ which wa direct against these violat but did not affect polit aspect wa also legal thu began the first industri period of the ecolog movement approxim 1958 1982 dure thi period the

state wa abl to channel thi social activ in the direct it need nevertheless accumul experi with the institution natur protect movement allow peopl to gradual come to the conclus that larg scale ecolog problem could not be solv within the framework of the offici structur the rapid buildup of ecolog problem in the second half of the 1970s and earli 1980s also promot thi awar the attempt to deal with thi wave of violat which were the result of object econom and social caus and the sin of the system led to an increas number of confront between the natur protect movement and the system s influenti link begin with bureaucrat poacher and end with the ministri which join the initi to revers the flow of the northern river ecologist were made to understand that thei were interf in what wa not their busi the crisi of the movement brought a new stage of the movement into be the petit stage approxim 1982 1989 thi stage wa character by the greater independ and larger scale of the ecolog movement it still remain a natur protect movement and appeal primarili to the author intend to chang their particular decis and at the same time not chang the system but the ecolog movement and group independ select the object of the attack without take into account the elit s posit and resort to mass mobil mean thei call on the popul and propos that thei support the appeal to the author dure thi period the movement acquir a primarili negativist orient ecologist spoke out against the most destruct instal and project hope to restrain industri expans and local it harm consequ such a strategi in the ecolog organ unit peopl of the most divers view from conserv ethnocrat to anarchist the first mass campaign of thi stage end in success in 1986 the river revers project which had origin been support by the countri s highest leadership includ the architect of perestroyka wa cancel although the former system of water manag wa preserv and the problem of water suppli which revers the river wa suppos to resolv continu to worsen the posit of the countri s leader in relat to the grow ecolog movement in thi stage wa rel favor the protest of the citizen driven to desper wa direct against the local bureaucrat leadership and fit the strategi of pressur from below which wa suppos to make the local clan more conciliatori toward the perestroyka leadership the father of perestroyka appeal to the public thei need a power public movement but on which would not encroach upon the foundat of the system that is on the highest leadership s author the origin apolit natur of the movement and the patriot conservat which later took on an anticommunist slant of mani of it leader from the writer milieu the concentr on particular object and the lack of a construct program seem to guarante that the process wa under control howev it becam explos the year 1987 1989 were the most product from the standpoint of the number of movement which aros and the scale of demonstr the need to coordin effort in the petit and ralli campaign brought broad associ of ecolog organ and movement to life in 1987 1988 the social ecolog allianc soe emerg in 1989 the even broader green movement emerg about a million

for revers water resourc and power engin giant the katun ge for exampl were buri but given the preserv of the former econom system thi promot greater paralysi of the economi which in itself wa caus by other thing these process promot greater opposit by the regim to the ecolog movement thi could not fail to caus the politic of the ecolog mass and that wa extrem danger to the cpsu which wa lose equilibrium the continu concess threaten the superindustri econom system with perman paralysi at the same time howev the ecolog crisi continu to expand despit the local success of the green sinc it wa caus by deeper reason than ill will or the stupid of particular functionari thi stalem meant a crisi not onli of govern polici in the field of ecolog but also a crisi of the ecolog movement itself the negativ of it demand dure thi period wa unpromis the problem built up faster than enterpris could be close but even the close of enterpris did not yet resolv the problem the ecolog movement need a construct altern and a posit ideal which could suggest a solut to the problem in principl the need for thi altern program wa also dictat by critic of the ecolog movement for it negativ natur from the veri start the ecolog movement had formul altern program capabl of offer solut to local ecolog crise but these altern were primarili technic their great complex as compar to simpl but ecolog harm

thi period promot special of the movement and formul of comprehens altern technic project project of the six section of voop and the power engin project of novosibirsk pamyat but all these project also remain unreal when thei ran up against the sociopolit structur of industri bureaucrat societi the de ideolog of the ecolog movement more and more becam an anachron in 1989 it provok more and more seriou conflict the accept of novosibirsk pamyat into soe caus a multitud of protest by it member despit the lack of ecolog claim against thi organ the attempt to reconcil the entir polit spectrum from patriot to anarchist within the framework of the ecolog movement prove increasingli hopeless a new stage of the ecolog movement began thi stage can be call populist 1989 1991 it first symptom were reveal dure the 1989 elect campaign when the ecolog movement support candid who advanc ecolog slogan the politic of the ecolog movement and the move by most ecolog organ to open opposit to the cpsu by 1990 requir the promot of a polit idea which would not split the uniti of the activist who were assembl in them thi idea wa found most quickli in the union republ here the idea of protect the

in part armenia start in 1988 account for thi a coincid of factor of the petit and populist period as well as the geograph compact of the territori result in a sharp increas in the size of the ecolog

not plai a signific role in most organ after thi for variou reason the mass conscious of the polit activ strata of the popul reject chauvinist and near chauvinist idea the guilt complex of a larg

sector ha striven to reduc the plan deficit as much as possibl in addit to the 100 billion dong contribut to reduc the deficit effort have been made to further reduc the deficit in order to creat sourc of invest capit for a number of urgent capit construct project the sector must continu to strive to reduc the electr loss norm in the north it is now higher than the norm set reduc failur rate improv safeti and increas the prestig of the electr network particularli that of the electr distribut network and control the price of electr sold retail to consum in rural area 2 on coal product and suppli even though there ar mani difficulti concern distribut market within the countri the thermoelectr plant still us veri small amount of coal and coal export ar limit becaus of mani factor becaus the coal sector ha us mani control measur such as increas intern sale to household outsid the electr sector and export small amount and gradual rais domest coal price to almost the level of product cost the amount of wash coal produc and sold ha exceed the plan norm and increas as compar with 1992 the amount of wash coal produc reach 4 768 million ton which is 100 5 percent of the plan norm and

demand for electr power ha exceed the rate of growth in power output peak to vallei differenti have continu to grow and there is a shortag of peak regul power sourc these have result in extrem irrat phenomena of the grid restrict power at peak load and be forc to shut down gener dure vallei in cold reserv b main problem face the grid 1 insuffici power sourc start in the earli 1970s the pace of power construct in the northeast china grid ha consist lag behind the rate of growth of our nation economi dure the seventh 5 year plan it instal gener capac grew at an averag annual rate of 8 0 percent which wa 1 percent lower than our nation averag the grid ha seriou power shortag and an instal gener capac shortag of about 4 000mw it power output shortag is about 20 billion kwh in 1990 the averag daili restrict power load wa 1 708mw 2 insuffici electr power for peak regul rapid growth in the northeast china grid s power us load chang in the structur of electr us and signific chang in the characterist of system load have caus peak to vallei differenti to rise each year from 1 640mw in 1980 to 5 525mw in 1991 howev the proport of instal hydropow gener capac which ha primari respons for peak regul function ha declin each year from 44 percent in 1957 to 16 7 percent in 1991 at the end of 1991 the grid s total instal hydropow gener capac wa 3 920mw while the actual amount of hydropow involv in peak regul capac wa 2 500mw which is about 47 percent of the peak to vallei differenti so there is an addit 3 000mw in peak regul capac that must be born by thermal power gener project indic that the maximum peak to vallei differenti will reach 13 760mw in 2000 so there will be an even greater shortag of peak regul power 3 energi resourc shortag northeast china ha a heavi industri type econom structur in which the raw materi industri is the main factor in 1989 it energi resourc consumpt per 10 000 yuan in industri valu of output wa 82 62 ton which wa 13 56 ton higher than the nation averag the northeast china region s industri valu of output account for 15 percent of our nation total includ about 20 percent of our nation heavi industri valu of output but the region ha onli 63 7 billion ton of coal reserv just 9 percent of our nation total and thei ar develop slow northeast china also ha limit convent hydropow resourc just 2 3 percent of china s theoret reserv it ha 14 188mw of develop and usabl hydropow resourc just 2 percent of our nation total and it is develop slowli 4 capit shortag the main reason that the northeast china region s coal and electr power industri have develop slowli is a shortag of capit dure the seventh 5 year plan the state invest 4 14 billion yuan in capit in electr power construct in the northeast china grid just 8 9 percent of the nation total 46 3 billion yuan the invest in hydropow wa even smaller onli 750 million yuan equal to 5 9 percent of the region s total invest in electr power 12 7 billion yuan ii acceler hydropow develop fight to build 5 000mw the energi resourc shortag is the primari factor restrict china s nation econom develop and major effort to acceler hydropow construct ar an import part of northeast china s energi resourc develop strategi current the northeast china region s instal hydropow gener capac as a proport of the region s total instal gener capac ha been declin each year and is expect to fall to 13 percent by 1995 the develop and util rate of hydropow resourc is rather low about 27 percent growth in instal hydropow gener capac ha been slow averag 3 4 percent annual from 1986 to 1990 thi situat obvious cannot meet econom develop requir for thi reason electr power industri construct prior to 2000 and in the futur should take full advantag of hydropow resourc and make major effort to develop hydropow in particular we should seiz the great opportun at present to acceler and intensifi reform move hydropow construct in the northeast china region up to a new stage doubl the capac and fight to build 5 000mw in instal gener capac a the northeast china grid s need for hydropow 1 to solv the larg grid s peak regul frequenc regul and accid reserv problem ensur safe and econom oper and increas the number of util hour for thermal power gener it instal hydropow gener capac should compris 25 to 30 percent of it total instal gener capac base on thi estim the instal hydropow gener capac requir by northeast china region as a whole will be 10 000mw in 2000 and 25 000mw in 2020 2 hydropow ha primari respons for grid peak regul task and assum respons for peak load oper in daili load chart the grid will requir a peak regul capac of 13 760mw in 2000 and hydropow will have to be respons for 10 000mw the daili oper time for hydropow should be three to five hour prior to 2000 the northeast china grid will place a larg number of 300mw and 600mw thermal power gener and nuclear power plant into oper in success growth in household electr consumpt in it power us structur will continu to be greater than growth in industri electr us load rate will also drop and peak to vallei differenti will becom larger so it would be best for the number of util hour for hydropow gener to be 1 300 to 1 600 hour year b acceler construct of convent hydropow station base on the northeast china region s hydropow resourc distribut characterist develop condit and peak regul requir we should acceler the develop of convent hydropow station in the three provinc over the next decad and strive to complet 1 540mw of capac by 2000 the main project ar two medium size cascad power station at gaol and jinkeng in liaon provinc with a design total instal gener capac of 145mw i suggest 240mw in jilin provinc the songjiang he cascad power station with a total instal gener capac of 510mw where prepar to begin construct ar now in progress and liangjiang power station with a plan instal gener capac of 60mw i propos 120mw in heilongjiang provinc lianhua hydropow station with a total instal gener capac of 550mw where construct is now underwai and xin e power station with a plan instal gener capac of 100mw i propos 120mw c acceler construct of pump storag power station pump storag power station have dual role in peak regul and fill vallei thei can serv as fast emerg accid reserv in electr power system and improv the reliabl of grid power suppli and thei have becom a publicli acknowledg econom peak regul power sourc all over the world liaon and heilongjiang provinc have alreadi done pump storag power station plan and reliabl research work and jilin provinc plan to undertak plan work in an effort to complet 2 950mw of pump storag power station by the year 2000 the main project ar the first phase project at pushi he pump storag power station in liaon provinc which will have a total instal gener capac of 1 000mw and an ultim capac of 2 000mw and an effort will be made for a formal construct start in 1995 a second on is huanggou pump storag power station in heilongjiang provinc with a total instal gener capac of 1 200mw thi power station will us lianhua hydropow station as it lower pool so it would be best if it construct wa synchron with lianhua hydropow station i suggest that prepar for construct be made in 1994 and that construct be formal start in 1995 anoth project is baishan pump storag power station in jilin provinc where i propos a total instal gener capac of 750mw and a formal construct start in 1996 d acceler construct of expans project at old hydropow station becaus the northeast china region ha veri few hydropow resourc it should consid gradual expans of old hydropow station while it is build new hydropow station dure the 1970s we expand jingpo hu hydropow station expand capac 60mw and in the 1980s we also expand shuifeng power station on an intern river and ad 135mw of capac in 1992 the baishan second phase and fengman second phase expans project were place into oper with 600mw at baishan second phase and 170mw at fengman second phase which increas the northeast china region s total instal hydropow gener capac to 4 305mw includ an expans of 965mw by the year 2000 we will strive to make an addit expans of 670mw in instal gener capac which will mainli includ the fengman hydropow station third phase project with an instal gener capac of 280mw where a construct start is expect in 1993 and an effort will be made to place the first gener into oper to gener power by the end of 1995 anoth project is the second phase project at hongshi hydropow station which will have an instal gener capac of 120 to 140mw where we will strive to begin construct in 1995 and we should speed up preparatori work huilongshan hydropow station will have an instal gener capac of 120mw and i suggest that the preliminari design be complet in octob 1993 the project should be establish in 1994 and construct should begin in 1995 at the huanren hydropow station second phase project for histor reason the normal water impound level at huanren hydropow station ha been lower 32 m and the instal gener capac reduc by on half the most ideal program is to increas the height of the larg huanren dam and rais the normal water impound level which could increas the instal gener capac by 200 to 300mw howev becaus of the extrem difficulti involv in requisit the land and resettl the popul in the present stage we can onli do research on how to increas the instal gener capac without increas the height of the larg dam the preliminari research plan to util two middl open in the dam to increas the instal gener capac by 100 to 150mw and i propos that preparatori work be speed up e spur develop and construct of boundari river power station intern river account for about 25 percent of the northeast china region s hydropow resourc with about 3 000mw on the heilong jiang about 1 200mw on the yalu jiang and about 110mw on the tumen jiang thu we must think of wai to creat the condit to develop and util intern river at present linjiang hydropow station on the yalu jiang ha an instal gener capac of 400mw 2 and examin of the preliminari design ha been complet i suggest that the sino korean council focu on work with the korean side and try to complet it and foster it benefit by 2000 iii a strateg program for hydropow develop in northeast china for 2020 after 2000 as industri and agricultur develop the northeast china grid s instal gener capac will more than doubl which will also requir substanti develop of hydropow the overal develop principl is a combin focu on build convent hydropow station and pump storag power station convent power station will be focus on the heilong jiang and nen jiang while pump storag power station will be center mainli on liaon and heilongjiang provinc the main project ar in liaon provinc the pushi he pump storag hydropow station second phase project with an instal gener capac of 1 000mw buyunshan pump storag power station with 1 000mw and the qingshil pump storag first phase project with 1 760mw in jilin provinc thei ar linjiang hydropow station with 400mw 2 manjiang hydropow station with 150mw and hadashan kei water conserv facil hydropow station with 80mw in heilongjiang provinc thei ar erdaog hydropow station with 50mw changjiangtun hydropow station with 210mw mohe hydropow station with 2 000mw 2 lianjin hydropow station with 1 000mw 2 sanjianfang pump

station with 125mw and gugu he hydropow station with 175mw after 2000 these three provinc and on autonom region should first develop mohe and lianjin power station on the trunk of the heilongjiang and convent hydropow station on the songhua jiang and nen jing while at the same time acceler construct of buyunshan wuchang sanjianfang and other pump storag power station in liaon and heilongjiang provinc for a project total instal hydropow gener capac of 19 943mw by 2020 iv primari measur that should be adopt a acceler preparatori work increas design reserv on characterist of hydropow station construct is a long period of preparatori work and larg invest moreov do good preparatori work for hydropow is also the foundat for hydropow construct thu on a foundat of do good river basin plan and electr power plan we certainli must do design and optim work well and fulli foster the decis make role and flexibl role of design in hydropow construct to meet the requir for design document compil examin and approv and report of project establish start of construct and progress in project construct in order to attain the object of shorten construct schedul and conserv project invest at present capit shortag for hydropow preparatori work in the northeast china region have result in veri few design reserv project and serious inadequ reserv strength for thi reason i propos that we set asid 3 to 5 percent each year from the major overhaul and upgrad fund for hydropow station that ar alreadi gener electr about 4 to 6 million yuan for hydropow plan feasibl research and preliminari design work after a project is establish it can be repaid or continu to be us as preparatori work fund grid bureau provinci bureau should focu on preparatori work in a plan manner and strengthen their relationship with design depart and local govern in an effort to have more reserv project for select b establish stabl hydropow construct fund if we wish to acceler hydropow develop in the northeast china region a promin issu is provid the invest thi is onli possibl by reli on reform and polici in the futur the state cannot substanti increas it invest in hydropow so we can consid adopt the follow measur 1 first we must set asid 0 02 yuan per kwh from the power gener by hydropow and invest all of it in hydropow construct at present the northeast china grid is gener 7 to 10 billion kwh of hydropow annual so thi could rais 140 to 200 million yuan in capit the construct fund that ar set asid should be under unifi calcul and deduct and unifi control of the grid to chang from the method of turn them over to the local area for manag thi could reduc unnecessari function organ and guarante ration util of the capit 2 we must activ promot the rais of capit via multipl channel and from multipl area fulli foster the initi of central author and local area and undertak inter provinci and inter enterpris joint hydropow develop for exampl heilongjiang provinc and inner mongolia could jointli develop hydropow station on the nen jiang we must also increas the number of hydropow util hour and give hydropow s peak regul to a portion of thermal power s increas power output that is us to compens for newli built hydropow station to be abl to entic enterpris to invest in hydropow 3 we should rais it from exist hydropow station benefit repai the interest to bank for those case in which the origin invest wa in the form of bank loan repai the princip and then re borrow loan to be us for hydropow develop we should implement peak and vallei electr price and expand the differenti newli built hydropow station should implement new price for new electr sourc and adopt price equal to those of thermal power for electr suppli to the grid on thi basi calcul the power gener benefit of hydropow and us part of thi capit as invest in hydropow construct we can also implement continu develop of cascad power station by us the benefit from power gener from the previou power station for continu invest in build the next hydropow station establish fund engag in roll develop and do continu construct we can also studi issu bond repai the princip and interest after go into oper and other measur c intensifi reform of the hydropow construct system china s reform and open up have now enter a new develop stage northeast china s hydropow develop and construct should seiz thi favor opportun further liber ideolog transform concept acceler hydropow construct and strive to move up to a new stage 1 the grid bureau must strengthen unifi manag work over hydropow develop and construct improv
