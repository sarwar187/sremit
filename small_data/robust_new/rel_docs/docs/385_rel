matsushita batteri industri compani and sanyo electr compani howev batteri manufactur who cite the close type pb batteri as the best candid for the vehicl to be present in 1997 cite the high cost of the nickel hydrogen batteri as a problem sai a certain batteri manufactur it mai be almost doubl the weight energi densiti as the pb batteri but it is three to four time the cost it also ha problem

the close type pb batteri manufactur that see the nickel hydrogen batteri as promis also predict that the li base batteri will succe the nickel hydrogen batteri the attract of the li base batteri is it high energi densiti there is no other materi that can be us for a secondari batteri that would rais energi densiti higher than lithium it can rais weight energi densiti to about 180 wh kg calcul in term of distanc travel per charg thi is 340 km when realiz it can be expect to perform on a par with a gasolin vehicl it will be well into the futur befor actual us of the li base batteri it probabl

concept car that us gasolin substitut and which stress the singl point of practic among the latter were two car exhibit by toyota motor and nissan base on the absolut ident idea of have interior space rival that of a larg car but with the car size and fuel consumpt of a small car the pudgi appear could not be call attract even as an empti compliment but the two compani both insist that in the futur thi type of thoroughli ration car will becom mainstream howev the true feel of japanes automak do not welcom such a chang inexpens compact and practic were onc characterist of japanes car but that is no longer the case sinc size increas and everi conceiv type of new technolog continu to be pile on dure the bubbl period car ar no longer either inexpens or compact it is point out that thei ar excess

neon the focu of much attent into the north american market it is expect that the minimum price of thi small passeng car will be about 9 000 a passeng car with engin displac of 2 000 cc it price at

gener a surplu it is like produc it mere to maintain the plant s rate of oper fix cost such as personnel expens and repay expens which soar dure the bubbl period have becom encumbr and their constitut is such that thei cannot turn a profit just by the manufactur of inexpens car of cours thei ar desper try to cut cost by do thing like us part in common with other compani and valu analysi va but just try to reduc price by an accumul of small devic natur ha limit confront by the doubl punch of the strong yen and the sudden chang in the big three s wai of make car aggrav a feel of ineffect of effort to reduc cost in unit of sen 1 10 of a yen the drop in moral of the develop team is also a big problem recent most of the new car put on sale had to undergo a sudden price revis in the cours of develop thi is due to the need to hold down the sale price even a littl amid the strengthen cost orient of consum for thi reason at the time that develop work gain consider ground thei were order to us part in common with other model and elimin equip a technician at on manufactur sai becaus top manag sai thi thing or that thing is unnecessari or wast there is a great deal of dissatisfact in develop sale chang just by appear ar consum realli emphas practic compani ar also becom shock when unit sale drop radic onc the new car effect dissip sever month after the begin of sale and thi is amplifi the bewilder of develop team in august toyota did a minor chang to it luxuri passeng car crown but within the industri there were mani who describ it as virtual a full model chang ordinarili a minor chang is confin to small alter such as make improv to part the addit of variat etc howev the crown receiv major modif it receiv the major surgeri of have it front grill bumper and rear area remodel so that it round style wa return to a sharper corner version that is closer to the older type of crown the crown ha been on of toyota s moneymak rank right alongsid the mark ii howev go into thi year it sale perform drop to far less than the monthli target of 17 000 unit and continu to be extrem sluggish at a monthli averag of just over 9 000 unit the old angular style crown maintain a respect level of sale even when it wa at the end of it model period therefor toyota decid to bring it closer to the old style which had enjoi such a favor recept septemb sale had recov to just over 14 000 unit so the situat ha improv but the analysi of an execut at a rival maker is that thi is evid that even toyota which is hail as the repres of the market in type firm ha start have difficulti get

drop at on point to about 80 per month increas suddenli to 699 unit in septemb the infin ha been us the rare grilleless appear as a point of appeal to consum as a luxuri car howev with the extrem sluggish sale it chang it tune even though sale mai increas the distress will not diminish on compani offici complain that for sale to chang thi much just by chang the appear on lose confid in whether consum now ar realli valu practic sale of honda s domani the small passeng car it began sell in novemb 1992 ar also letharg at about half the monthli sale target of 3 000 unit the domani wa the first small car in japan to offer a driver s side air bag as standard equip in an appeal to safeti consider howev vice presid yoshino recogn the mistaken read of the market sai mani custom sai thei don t

portfolio nearli 50 billion cubic meter ar consum and thi cover 25 percent of the nation energi requir it hold a place of honor after petroleum that ha been won over 20 year of continu progress the demand ha in fact increas to it present level from 13 billion cubic meter in 1970 further leap ahead ar foreseen for the immedi futur accord to forecast made by snam nation ga pipelin compani at the turn of the centuri about 75 billion cubic meter should be avail to meet the domest requir the growth in the us of thi sourc of energi ha been determin by it characterist of flexibl and high effici it should not be forgotten that the environment variabl which ha becom ever more import ha been on of the factor that ha contribut to both the success and the multipl of us of natur ga in fact the combust of methan liber neither sulfur dioxid nor particl and assist in reduc for the same amount of energi us the emiss of carbon dioxid nitrogen oxid and volatil organ compound although three quarter of the consumpt of methan in itali is destin to civil and industri us the 10 year from 1980 to 1990 have seen the us of methan for the gener of electr triplic and thi is the sector where the environment advantag of the fuel should open up further new opportun for develop the opportun for the futur us of methan in the road transport sector should also be stress last juli fiat and snam sign

to the corpor that form part of the eni nation hydrocarbon corpor group the medium term goal of the oper is that a quota of vehicl for person and public transport should have methan engin in short there ar mani initi underwai that will lead to a further increas in the demand for ga l impresa ambient discuss these subject with snam manag director alberto meomartini pavesi let us start with the methan automobil the largest nation produc of automobil and the public corpor that essenti manag methan throughout itali have form an allianc to creat a revolutionari engin is the gasolin era come to an end meomartini no without a doubt there is no risk that gasolin will becom obsolet neither at present nor in the futur it would be better to sai that from now on methan power vehicl will no longer be confin to the realm of utopia thi is the real mean of the agreement that we have stipul with fiat it is the signal that there ar space in elect area in thi case urban traffic where the us of methan could provid an excel concret answer to environment problem in fact the combust of methan mean increas effici and therefor energi save and contain level of pollut emiss such as in the case of carbon monoxid or no emiss as for sulfur dioxid and particl pavesi is thi valid for all road vehicl meomartini theoret ye howev it is necessari to go ahead gradual it is clear that for automobil and privat transport in gener there ar some rigid element that ar not easi to overcom such as refuel and autonomi over a distanc the agreement with fiat focus on public transport start with taxi and compani fleet as far as automobil ar concern and also buse of cours iveco alreadi produc buse that ar exclus power by methan we do not think that it is as import to talk about larg number todai as it is to talk of the high symbol valu that is behind thi initi and even if we should quantifi the phenomena let us not forget that public transport ha noteworthi incid on the global level of pollut within the citi pavesi i suppos that the cost of these prototyp ar not competit meomartini the cost of the vehicl will initi be higher if howev we look into all the dynam of cost benefit we discov that thi is a half truth on the other side of the balanc we must put the high energi effici of the methan engin and the low cost of thi fuel as well as obvious the lower cost for the environ that we should all be take into account at last thei ar all posit variabl within the complet manag plan at ravenna where five methan power buse ar alreadi circul the verdict of the administr and the popul on thi first experi ar more than flatter pavesi ar you work on anyth els meomartini a seri of contact with the public administr ar underwai we ar think of an agreement between iveco and snam and the emilia romagna region on a signific substitut within a specifi time of the entir fleet of buse in circul the biggest mistak in thi case as in other case is to think that public opinion is the onli retard forc against the introduct of innov product onto the market such as methan power vehicl result ar onli obtain by start with a constant comparison in which the public sector parti who is the real manag of the initi is not left alon pavesi let us come to the tradit us of methan how much ha the environ contribut to the increas in consumpt of thi energi sourc meomartini if by the environ we do not onli mean minor pollut but also the save of resourc i would sai that thi variabl ha had a veri import influenc on the develop of it us in the past natur ga wa often consid and us onli as a substitut for other fossil sourc in the cours of the year research ha produc a great improv in effici and energi output and thi is a plu that ha been appreci more and more if we add to thi a combust process that produc level of pollut that ar lower than those of other energi sourc the circl is complet pavesi what form will the scene take in the year 2000 how will natur ga compar with other energi sourc meomartini itali ha reserv of over 300 billion cubic meter and produc between 16 and 17 billion cubic meter a year which form the basi thi quantiti not have vari for mani year we ar count on be abl to increas the flow of ga come from abroad that todai account for about 70 percent of the total requir thi thank to an increas in the avail of ga from algeria follow the instal of a second ga pipelin across the mediterranean that will allow an increas in the suppli from the present 13 14 billion cubic meter to 19 billion cubic meter in 1995 which becom 23 billion when the ga purchas directli by enel italian natini the develop of the consumpt of natur ga is a worldwid characterist howev we cannot imagin that our project can grow without limit the entir energi market must have it own equilibrium repres by balanc relationship between the variou sourc methan is to be us where it is econom and technolog more conveni in thi balanc view the greatest obstacl is that of fiscal polit which through the multipl of levi weigh heavili and therefor penal anoth problem that aris dure the lai of ga pipelin is that of the environment norm we ar still not formal subject to an evalu of the environment impact despit thi the network of norm in our countri is particularli complic and bureaucrat so much so that sometim it realli slow work down it is a piti becaus we in snam have a great and

FBIS3-60384: languag italian articl type bfn interview with alberto meomartini manag director of the italian nation ga corpor by fabio pavesi place and date not given methan candid itself as the sourcer for the year 2000 first six paragraph ar l impresa ambient introduct text sinc there ar abund resourc of natur ga and it is a versatil fuel it is now in first place in the italian energi portfolio nearli 50 billion cubic meter ar consum and thi cover 25 percent of the nation energi requir it hold a place of honor after petroleum that ha been won over 20 year of continu progress the demand ha in fact increas to it present level from 13 billion cubic meter in 1970 further leap ahead ar foreseen for the immedi futur accord to forecast made by snam nation ga pipelin compani at the turn of the centuri about 75 billion cubic meter should be avail to meet the domest requir the growth in the us of thi sourc of energi ha been determin by it characterist of flexibl and high effici it should not be forgotten that the environment variabl which ha becom ever more import ha been on of the factor that ha contribut to both the success and the multipl of us of natur ga in fact the combust of methan liber neither sulfur dioxid nor particl and assist in reduc for the same amount of energi us the emiss of carbon dioxid nitrogen oxid and volatil organ compound although three quarter of the consumpt of methan in itali is destin to civil and industri us the 10 year from 1980 to 1990 have seen the us of methan for the gener of electr triplic and thi is the sector where the environment advantag of the fuel should open up further new opportun for develop the opportun for the futur us of methan in the road transport sector should also be stress last juli fiat and snam sign an agreement for the perfect of an engin that is exclus power by methan the agreement which provid for an initi fund of 10 billion lire assign the definit of the logist and organiz aspect of the oper to the corpor that form part of the eni nation hydrocarbon corpor group the medium term goal of the oper is that a quota of vehicl for person and public transport should have methan engin in short there ar mani initi underwai that will lead to a further increas in the demand for ga l impresa ambient discuss these subject with snam manag director alberto meomartini pavesi let us start with the methan automobil the largest nation produc of automobil and the public corpor that essenti manag methan throughout itali have form an allianc to creat a revolutionari engin is the gasolin era come to an end meomartini no without a doubt there is no risk that gasolin will becom obsolet neither at present nor in the futur it would be better to sai that from now on methan power vehicl will no longer be confin to the realm of utopia thi is the real mean of the agreement that we have stipul with fiat it is the signal that there ar space in elect area in thi case urban traffic where the us of methan could provid an excel concret answer to environment problem in fact the combust of methan mean increas effici and therefor energi save and contain level of pollut emiss such as in the case of carbon monoxid or no emiss as for sulfur dioxid and particl pavesi is thi valid for all road vehicl meomartini theoret ye howev it is necessari to go ahead gradual it is clear that for automobil and privat transport in gener there ar some rigid element that ar not easi to overcom such as refuel and autonomi over a distanc the agreement with fiat focus on public transport start with taxi and compani fleet as far as automobil ar concern and also buse of cours iveco alreadi produc buse that ar exclus power by methan we do not think that it is as import to talk about larg number todai as it is to talk of the high symbol valu that is behind thi initi and even if we should quantifi the phenomena let us not forget that public transport ha noteworthi incid on the global level of pollut within the citi pavesi i suppos that the cost of these prototyp ar not competit meomartini the cost of the vehicl will initi be higher if howev we look into all the dynam of cost benefit we discov that thi is a half truth on the other side of the balanc we must put the high energi effici of the methan engin and the low cost of thi fuel as well as obvious the lower cost for the environ that we should all be take into account at last thei ar all posit variabl within the complet manag plan at ravenna where five methan power buse ar alreadi circul the verdict of the administr and the popul on thi first experi ar more than flatter pavesi ar you work on anyth els meomartini a seri of contact with the public administr ar underwai we ar think of an agreement between iveco and snam and the emilia romagna region on a signific substitut within a specifi time of the entir fleet of buse in circul the biggest mistak in thi case as in other case is to think that public opinion is the onli retard forc against the introduct of innov product onto the market such as methan power vehicl result ar onli obtain by start with a constant comparison in which the public sector parti who is the real manag of the initi is not left alon pavesi let us come to the tradit us of methan how much ha the environ contribut to the increas in consumpt of thi energi sourc meomartini if by the environ we do not onli mean minor pollut but also the save of resourc i would sai that thi variabl ha had a veri import influenc on the develop of it us in the past natur ga wa often consid and us onli as a substitut for other fossil sourc in the cours of the year research ha produc a great improv in effici and energi output and thi is a plu that ha been appreci more and more if we add to thi a combust process that produc level of pollut that ar lower than those of other energi sourc the circl is complet pavesi what form will the scene take in the year 2000 how will natur ga compar with other energi sourc meomartini itali ha reserv of over 300 billion cubic meter and produc between 16 and 17 billion cubic meter a year which form the basi thi quantiti not have vari for mani year we ar count on be abl to increas the flow of ga come from abroad that todai account for about 70 percent of the total requir thi thank to an increas in the avail of ga from algeria follow the instal of a second ga pipelin across the mediterranean that will allow an increas in the suppli from the present 13 14 billion cubic meter to 19 billion cubic meter in 1995 which becom 23 billion when the ga purchas directli by enel italian natini the develop of the consumpt of natur ga is a worldwid characterist howev we cannot imagin that our project can grow without limit the entir energi market must have it own equilibrium repres by balanc relationship between the variou sourc methan is to be us where it is econom and technolog more conveni in thi balanc view the greatest obstacl is that of fiscal polit which through the multipl of levi weigh heavili and therefor penal anoth problem that aris dure the lai of ga pipelin is that of the environment norm we ar still not formal subject to an evalu of the environment impact despit thi the network of norm in our countri is particularli complic and bureaucrat so much so that sometim it realli slow work down it is a piti becaus we in snam have a great and consolid tradit of environment conserv it is enough to think of the ga pipelin for import across countri such as austria the netherland germani and switzerland that as far as environment sever is

technic research center that mazda establish to concentr on new technolog wa in 1985 at it headquart in hiroshima and then in 1987 it ad the yokohama technic research center in yokohama the basic idea behind open the technic research center here in yokohama wa to us the slogan at the time build an automobil cultur what thi mean is not treat the car simpli as a mean of travel but treat it as on of the essenti element of societi and cultur that peopl need when the research center initi receiv word of thi new slogan the research center at mazda headquart in hiroshima decid to put it emphasi on new technolog that were directli relat to the develop of car type wherea the research center in yokohama decid it would focu on basic technolog in advanc field orient toward automobil technolog of the 21st centuri at present the two research center ar exchang idea and deepen ti with on anoth base on respect area of expertis and ar steadili plai more import role as the core place within mazda for develop new technolog next befor we get into specif research activ i would like to discuss my own view regard research 3 person view regard research research institut ar at the pinnacl of research and develop and have an import mission in develop and explor consum technolog for that reason i feel that research institut have to reflect the long term and medium term need of consum in their research with that in mind i would like to take the opportun here to state the direct i believ that consum trend ar go until now compani have stress high valu ad car that offer more in the wai of divers perform and function in the futur howev there will probabl be a shift from superfici enjoy need to more basic enjoy need the need for exampl to maintain respect for human life whether on s own or other is grow ever more stronger in term of both product safeti and the environ for exampl someth ha to be done about the more than 10 000 peopl a year that die in auto accid and the other problem that exist such as environment pollut caus by carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid and also find other energi altern to petroleum these problem ar an immedi and futur threat to ourselv our famili and our children and ar caus for concern these ar essenti problem that have to do with the car itself so if we ar to resolv these issu we must steadili stockpil those technolog with an ey toward the futur with that said i would now like to introduc some area of research to show the work we ar do in tackl some of these problem 4 research activ outlin in thi section i have divid the research activ into

contact corros problem of aluminum steel with aluminum steel clad the uniqu featur of nissan s aq x is the adopt of an iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur by us an aluminum alloi for certain structur compon and for the outer and inner panel for it door front hood front fender and trunk lid instead of the aluminum alloi that is not suitabl for deep draw mold steel sheet ar us for the outer and inner panel of the rear fender which ha a sever curv surfac as a result of adopt the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur the weight of the aq x is approxim 20 percent less than that of previou bodi made of steel outer panel thi drastic weight reduct seem to indic that the adopt of the hybrid structur is expect to meet futur auto specif sinc accord to on offici no matter how much a bodi structur is ration the weight of the exist steel bodi will be reduc onli by sever percent at best gener whenev sheet steel and aluminum alloi part ar us togeth the joint ar attack by corros that result from the contact of dissimilar metal the corros is commonli call galvan corros and such joint have to be avoid altogeth in auto bodi construct therefor auto bodi part in which aluminum alloi can be us ar limit to such part as front hood trunk lid and hing part that function as a lid such as quickli detach sun roof otherwis like the nsx sport car of honda motor co ltd all the bodi ha to be made with an aluminum alloi with onli the smallest area of contact with steel nissan solv the problem of contact corros between steel and aluminum alloi for the aq x by insert steel aluminum alloi clad piec in the joint the steel aluminum alloi clad piec ar insert between an aluminum alloi outer panel and a steel inner panel when thei ar to be spot weld to form a monocoqu bodi the aluminum alloi layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel and the steel layer of the clad piec is in direct contact with the steel inner panel befor the entir assembl is spot weld as a result aluminum is weld to aluminum and steel is weld to steel as a whole the aluminum outer panel and the steel inner panel ar bond to each other nissan is us the same cold roll steel panel spcd spce as

onli on spot weld voltag is requir for spot weld steel to steel as well as aluminum to aluminum yoshitaka kurihara chief research at the vehicular research laboratori of nissan s gener research institut sai thi we chose the ratio of the aluminum alloi to the steel in the clad materi in such a wai that on voltag can do both weld job simultan clad materi have two atom layer of dissimilar metal arrang tightli next to each other so no air can infiltr between the two layer thu neither oxid nor reduct take place as a result no potenti differ is gener between the steel and aluminum alloi layer and that prevent ani corros process from take place between the two dissimilar metal nissan improv the bodi rigid of the aq x through both design and materi and accord to kurihara both bend and twist rigid ar 20 percent higher than those of previou car of the same class nissan successfulli prevent ani loss of rigid despit the incorpor of aluminum the gaug of the aluminum alloi sheet like that of previou aluminum alloi part wa made 1 4 time that of the sheet steel to maintain the same tensil rigid as that of a sheet steel bodi the separ of steel from aluminum in an auto bodi the critic process in the recycl of car to be dispos of wa made technic possibl by nissan for the aq x by heat to approxim 500 c a brittl intermetal compound is form at the interfac of the steel and aluminum alloi layer of the clad materi which make it easi to separ the two layer with light impact nissan believ that the iron aluminum hybrid bodi structur is a weight reduct technolog with a high probabl of implement becaus the advantag of weight reduct can be balanc against the ad cost through the optim of the ratio of cheap sheet steel to lightweight aluminum alloi accord to kurihara as far as the cost problem is concern although it is difficult to make a thorough assess at thi time it appear that a certain cost increas is unavoid not onli doe the aluminum alloi cost approxim three time as much as the steel the ratio of the materi unit price x the ratio of the densiti but the product cost is also high for the aluminum alloi becaus the spot weld electrod s life is shorter for the alloi than for steel audi

thi asf model for the mass test product of the a8 which is to replac the current sold luxuri v8 the a8 is schedul to be introduc to the german market in mai 1994 although the price of the a8 ha not been announc it ha been rumor that the price will exce the price of the v8 of 11 4 million it is specul that the car could afford an all aluminum alloi bodi becaus of it high price statu and the moder product rate of approxim 2 400 vehicl per month most of todai s passeng car have a monocoqu bodi that function as the structur materi for outer and inner panel in contrast the frame alon of the space frame structur function as the structur compon for the bodi and outer panel ar primarili us as the exterior partit therefor the space frame structur ha the advantag of be abl to maintain rigid despit the adopt of materi less rigid than steel such as aluminum alloi and resin for the outer and inner panel anoth import advantag of the space frame structur is that it enabl the us of compar cheaper extrud materi for the frame structur compon extrud materi can be made with heavier gaug for us in spot that requir high rigid or thei can be made with thinner gaug for us in spot that requir low rigid furthermor even if section with insuffici rigid happen to be construct in a space frame structur made of extrud frame the weak can easili be compens for with stiffen rib for the space frame structur of the asf car exhibit at the show the lowest cost extrud materi wa us in the largest quantiti the next lowest cost die cast materi wa us in the next to largest quantiti and the highest cost roll materi wa us in the smallest quantiti howev base on the concept disclos in 1991 in which extrud frame materi were to be connect with a die cast bond materi for the asf concept model mani observ at the

auto driven 10 000 mile a year that is mainli becaus of the batteri rel short life an impact owner would need to replac the batteri pack everi 20 000 mile at a cost of roughli 1 500 the electr to run the car would cost about 5 to 12 a month smith ad expect improv in batteri design in the next three to four year could extend batteri life to 50 000 mile which would make monthli oper cost competit with those of convent auto smith ad unlik electr vehicl that us exot nickel iron or sodium sulfur batteri as power sourc the impact us lead acid batteri whose 870 pound account for about 30 of the car s total weight but improv in batteri design elimin the need to add water and also overcom some of the tradit drawback of electr vehicl low speed short rang and the rel long time it take to recharg the averag electr vehicl now ha a top speed of 50 to 70 m p h and a rang of 60 to 100 mile it typic take up to 12 hour to recharg an exist electr vehicl but gm said the impact can be charg halfwai in as littl as half an hour and almost fulli recharg in six simpli by plug the vehicl into a home circuit eventu smith said he forese recharg circuit be place around citi much as some canadian citi put outlet at park meter to power engin warmer becaus the impact is design as a consum car rather than as a fleet vehicl it would have a much broader market than electr van a necess for mass product of a

person would like to see the american manufactur back on top he said but mcgee s idea hasn t gotten out of the garag yet he s never put hi new engin into a car and driven it to prove it work in addit there ar hundr of other design for electr car which make the odd veri long that mcgee s invent will becom standard equip in mass produc car car maker research and garag inventor have been tinker with

public hi invent to basic cry bull here is the technolog let s see you gui hunker down roll up your sleev and give it to the american public recent develop electr car those power by electr onli suffer from sever flaw thei ar sluggish and have a rang usual limit to less than 100 mile befor the batteri need recharg recharg can take sever hour gm impact can acceler much like convent car but it ha a rang of onli 120 mile by contrast mcgee s plan is to power a car with a convent motorcycl engin connect to an electr turbin he ha develop there also would be a turbin in each wheel 200 pound of batteri in the trunk and a comput near the dashboard accord to mcgee s blueprint the 25 pound steel turbin draw electr from the batteri and start the motorcycl engin the engin then drive the turbin which send electr power to the smaller turbin that drive each wheel the comput govern the whole process and divert excess electr from the turbin back to the batteri so thei ar constantli be recharg that give the car a rang of 500 to 600 mile he said the combin of the engin and turbin also give the car the equival of about 150 in peak horsepow even though the motorcycl engin consum less fuel than convent auto engin he said becaus the comput turbin system appli power directli to the wheel it also elimin the need for a convent transmiss brake differenti and power steer system he said the upshot of the system is that the engin us less fuel emit on third of the smog produc hydrocarbon of a typic six cylind engin and weigh on third less than convent car he said the turbin system also easili adapt to an intern combust engin us altern fuel such as ethanol or grain alcohol which would further cut the car s emiss he said peter b bo presid of polydyn inc a san mateo research firm said that even though he doe not know the specif of mcgee s plan mcgee ha the right approach in develop a hybrid turbin combust engin format there is no technolog i know of anywher in which an all electr vehicl can achiev the rang of a convent vehicl mainli becaus there is no batteri right now that i know of that will be abl to store suffici energi for a 300 to 400 mile rang bo said a hybrid can do that an all electr vehicl cannot he said mcgee said hi idea for a turbin assist car engin goe back a decad in 1982 he start hi own firm magna motiv industri and move to fairfield iowa becaus the state provid 150 000 in seed monei he start two other compani magnet research intern and am to rais fund for specif project and now plan to merg the three and move hi oper to camarillo the three firm which onli do
