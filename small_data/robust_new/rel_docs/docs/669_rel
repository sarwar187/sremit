resourc our countri can attain great power and reach a higher growth 5 in connect with the implement of the direct of the grand leader concern decreas consumpt in my opinion the method of taxat on

work ha progress well in societi howev what ha perhap caus the discont of the peopl is the lack of control in societi also good and product ar not control as thei should be and the econom polici do not consid the welfar of the peopl continu he said the govern must find wai to prevent pressur on such strata other than elimin subsidi in order for them to be abl to carri the burden of the societi further becaus the burden of the perpetu of the revolut is also on the shoulder of these dear on at the present time foreign currenc in our societi is smuggl out of the countri by the wealth accumul smuggler all the foreign currenc taken abroad is not to import machineri or resourc to the countri therefor we should choos a mechan that goe through the bank he ad at the present time factori due to financi inabl the increas in the price of foreign currenc and the number of import that exist in the countri do not have the manpow thei need and face on problem after anoth the factori closur in addit to put pressur on the economi and the depriv work class caus social corrupt on wai to fight corrupt is to creat job in societi in connect with control he said there is no control in societi taxi ar place at the dispos of taxi owner at the govern rate but in tehran no on ha yet been abl to control taxi fare and the taxi driver from where he pick up a passeng to where he drop the passeng off is disrespect to all govern offici in order to justifi hi own violat peopl still cannot understand why water is 30 toman per kg as publish sugar is 100 toman per kg then how is it that pastri in thi countri ar 300 toman per kg suppli and demand alon cannot solv these problem state that the econom polici must be revis and the polici maker must revis their view he said it is unfortun that when mr hashemi rafsanjani came to esfahan on of the high rake offici in a meet ask how much the rate of foreign currenc would be by the end of 1372 21 march 1993 20 march 1994 he respond that it would be 110 toman which result in the laughter of those present i am astonish how an econom polici maker of our who is still influenti in polit issu can have such a viewpoint and hope to deal with the polit issu of the countri then refer to the self sacrific of the peopl of najafabad he said in continu the path of the revolut and in order to show their obedi to the grand leader and preserv the promin person in societi the peopl of najafabad contribut the highest percentag of vote in the presidenti elect in the provinc with a 5 percent increas and extend an unpreced welcom to mr hashemi rafsanjani thi show the loyalti of these peopl to a regim in which no on ha invest as much as thei have thei ar fond of the regim of the islam republ and the leadership but these dear peopl ar veri fond of the rever shi it sourc of emul grand ayatollah montazeri becaus in our societi emul of a particular person is not an offens a religi jurist is not elect and the peopl have been and ar as thei ar but becaus of thi issu todai some allow themselv to carri out their object mere by defend the religi guardian in that citi thi ha weaken the moral of the peopl a peopl who have prove in practic befor everyon els that thei ar the follow of the religi guardian the dear peopl of najafabad ar upset with journalist who for reason of expedi accus him and hi emul of whatev thei wish in their newspap a spokesman who mai not even be consid hi pupil allow himself to question hi emul himself and hi student and make ani kind of insult and injustic against him i propos to the promin peopl that thi action is neither in the interest of the regim nor the grand cleric nor is it good for the uniti of the peopl how can we benefit from such behavior toward a person about whom the imam said your view give heat to the seminari and the sacr islam regim we request of the promin peopl that such behavior be stop and that the heart of the peopl not be wound barat ali mohammadifar deputi from sanqez and kolia i the last

most of the majl committe will propos new tax to secur the revenu resourc some of which ar reason and some unreason and on the whole the result will be higher price for good and servic the collect of tax within the framework of the law is desir but to put tax on everyth will caus great problem the next issu is the failur to observ social justic in the 1373 21 march 1994 20 march 1995 budget distribut the budget must be distribut among the provinc in such a wai that justic and fair ar observ so that not the slightest right of ani of the provinc is violat continu he said justic in the distribut of the budget must be such that everyon enjoi the resourc equal in proport to the popul and the vast of the provinc but unfortun we see that welfar resourc in some provinc ar in abund and in some other depriv rule todai the serv govern must sincer and decis defend the right of the peopl of all provinc and the ministri must avoid addit expenditur refer to the trick of the oppressor in their hostil toward the islam republ of iran the speaker continu appar in our countri the best and most studi program be implement suffer from the most trivial administr and servic obstacl and ultim if thei ar save onli a useless and weak shell of them remain henc ani movement to suppress and reform thi structur will face the violent reaction and discont of a number of peopl but discont and the violat of the right of ten of million of peopl of our countri ar much more signific ani studi in regard to administr corrupt bureaucraci and red tape in our countri show that thi issu is at the root of most of the discont in our countri and a legaci of the corrupt monarch bureaucraci in fact reform of the administr system is the wish of the revolutionari societi and will result in increas nation wealth avoid luxuri and show respect for the peopl ar import duti of the offici the speaker then ad some offici act on promis concern the elimin of the problem but some of the offici onli do so at the level of slogan and do not act on their oblig henc the majl must make everi effort to elimin depriv he also said on of the slogan of the regim of the islam republ is support for the oppress social justic is a central issu that the grand leader determin for the second plan and must not be forgotten under the pretext of develop of social justic and support for the oppress and the downtrodden who ar the main support of the revolut it is expect that in econom plan the authent duti of the revolut will not be trampl and the reason why the statement of the grand leader have had an effect on the soul of the peopl must be kept in mind sinc hi rever is not inclin toward thi world and toward luxuri and he love islam and the next world it is hope that the same is true of all the offici in conclus the deputi of sanqez and kolia i ask the high rank offici of the provinc of kermanshah to disregard certain margin task that ar not list in their duti and ask the head of the judici branch to see that

posit and no power ha the abil to elimin it the world that oppos thi revolut s aspir ha spare noth in it enmiti it rancor it brutal and it attempt to overthrow thi chang from the econom embargo to domest assassin the impos war and other plot on of the wonder of the islam revolut is that it ha resist proudli and ha continu to make it wai through these obstacl on of the islam revolut s most import success is that it ha been abl to awaken the light of awar and wake in the heart and mind of a great mass of the world s oppress and depriv peopl it ha creat an intellectu and cultur wave

that the imperialist and idolat of our ag ar veri afraid of thi wave of awaken in the nation that adher to islam passag omit discuss the accomplish of the revolut in gener term 1 a danger diseas in the revolut is reactionari thought which is beset it like a plagu it will soon have the abil to convert ani proud movement to silenc or withdraw reactionari with their decept and appar concern appear initi attract to themselv the naiv and fear those with littl substanc and a superfici view and thei make them pessimist about the chang of the revolut thei gradual make the peopl lose enthusiasm about the affair of the revolut and bring the revolut up against problem it appear to be a simpl thing to deal with these peopl who have a handsom exterior becaus the nobl prophet peac be upon him said two

fundament of the revolut with inappropri and unaccept analys and thei draw the revolut into deviat by us the appeal of renew and the inner tendenc of human be toward divers 3 anoth diseas in the revolut is that it aspir and program do not go beyond slogan and talk to get more public support and to creat condit for it export everi revolut must get beyond slogan and into action as quickli as possibl and it must solv the problem of life to an accept extent a revolut that is unabl to correct malfunct will not succe an import mission for everi revolut is to set model in variou sector a good model is the best and most evoc evid of a revolut s capabl the model is the precis action and physic manifest of slogan and aspir therefor on of the import shortcom of the slogan is the nonconform of action to word 1 as publish anoth diseas in the revolut is disput and alien among the revolutionari forc opportunist and flatter benefit greatli wherev these disput exist thei have gain a foothold for themselv insid the structur of the govern by make us of the atmospher of conflict and thei have made the revolut deviat with their explan and justif mr taqavi said in answer to the third question sentenc as publish offici must serv and thei must work sincer and set their heart on solv the problem of the peopl and the peopl must also support the offici in view of the criteria mention the offici

peopl must realiz that our three govern power make their decis independ and there is no type of foreign dominion over them thi is the greatest sourc of pride in thi connect a point that must be note is the role of the posit of the vice regenc of the chief jurisconsult and the leadership in recent year as chang have occur with our neighbor to the north mean the soviet union thei have suffer impot caus domest war becaus of not have proper leadership and there have been continu problem for them the peopl must never forget the role of orthodox faith and leadership our nation take inspir from the

wish to emphas that point so that the view of the iranian nation becom clear for all to see the point is that we do not expect the bulli and thug of the world to be good and not to behav like tyrant we do howev expect fair and independ from the forum of the world the unit nation is so call becaus it is a place which belong to nation it doe not belong to govern let alon to certain bulli greedi govern of the world unfortun the realiti is someth els todai and that is the veri ugli point of cours we had alreadi seen how the secur council act the secur council which is the princip decisionmak bodi and the heart of the unit nation we had realiz how much that organ wa in the hand of the superpow in crucial moment becom their rather than belong to the nation that wa dure the impos war when the impos war came and iraq violat our border and enter sever of our countri s provinc we took our protest to the unit nation as is usual as usual the secur council should have issu a resolut condemn iraq as the aggressor it fail to do so i wait sever dai the iraqi armi take advantag of our unsettl situat at that time settl itself on our belov countri s soil our belov islam iran it seiz sever thousand kilomet and then and onli then did the secur council lift it head to utter a word it issu a resolut what wa the resolut did it sai that the aggressor must leav iranian soil not at all it issu a resolut to the effect that iran and iraq should declar a ceas fire what doe that mean it mean that the iraqi armi ha enter iranian soil and now that it is the iranian nation s turn for a heroic defens it hand must be ti no on is to defend the countri and the iraqi should not be thrown out that wa the secur council s resolut you know that for sever year thei said the same thing without condemn the aggressor of cours our combat in not too long a period within almost on and a half year took back most of the land themselv that wa the preced for us then a few year later iraq s invas of kuwait took place when iraq invad kuwait there wa no oppress nation involv there it wa a question of the interest of america and the superpow you all saw how a first resolut wa issu in a matter of hour sai iraq must get out of kuwait for year we had ask the secur council to issu such a resolut against as heard us in the impos war but it would not do so but within hour it issu that resolut on kuwait then the secur council issu sever resolut on immedi follow the other permit the american to enter the persian gulf wreck iraq and do what thei like the secur council resolut on the kuwaiti war ar still in effect and still be implement we have seen that in recent month onc in the case of bosnia the secur council should have been fair we saw that it wa not anoth time wa in the case of the holi shrine of abraham in occupi palestin the muslim nation said thei were prepar to send soldier as un troop as a buffer between the serb and bosnian muslim the secur council said muslim cannot go becaus thei ar muslim and mai support on side of cours it wa a wrong thing to sai the muslim were go to mediat and act as a buffer not to fight anywai thei said that but at the same time thei allow russian soldier who ar obvious on friendli term with the serb to go as un troop and act as a buffer what happen why did thei not consid that the russian soldier ar connect to the serb from a standpoint of religion and other ti the world s magazin print photograph of russian tank bear the un insignia enter the region while the serb were shout slogan cheer and clap for them that wa on case bosnian muslim ar still be sacrif the unit nation doe not care a bit and the secur council doe not do it duti the second issu concern thi bloodi tragedi at the shrine of abraham israel should have been categor condemn it should have been punish it should have been put on trial it should have been forc to accept punish the unit nation should have done thi but it did not the secur council ha not taken on it respons at all what is the reason for thi the reason is the influenc of big power led by america in the secur council and their influenc on the secretari gener himself let them know that thi is the view of the islam republ and the peopl of iran the secretari gener himself paus crowd chant god is great khamen i is the leader death to those who oppos the suprem jurisconsult death to

confront the campaign on islam threat constitut a challeng to whoever accept such a role becaus there ar two wai to approach the truth about islam on of them is the easi wai present islam as a histor enemi with a doctrin and agenda for natur hostil to the west the difficult approach is to move awai from readi made clich and delv into an in depth analysi of the actual situat adopt the second approach provid the evid for the shortcom of adopt the first approach becaus islam is not khomeyni or al qadhdhafi and those among the muslim leader who adopt terror ar not necessarili the on who portrai the real islam mani of those who now bear the banner of islam ar perform polit action their object is polit for them islam is the guarante method to attract the largest number of peopl to

respons of the minist of interior then the minist of interior respons everi phenomenon ha a crystal and manifest and ha a seri of standard and measur as our revolut is an islam revolut and islam is a part of the essenc of our revolut and insepar from the revolut itself fight injustic oppress and heathen is a part of the essenc of the islam revolut he ad becaus the crystal of so much oppress

FBIS3-53625: languag persian articl type bfn unattribut commentari in the margin of the interior minist s remark in majl text the esteem interior minist mr besharati s answer to a question by rasht deputi elya hazrati about why student of the uniti consolid bureau ucb were not allow to stage a ralli against the unit state on 2 novemb on the anniversari of the occup of the american embassi in tehran is worthi of discuss sinc as he himself state our islam revolut is a revolut against world blasphemi and oppress and it symbol the unit state in the world todai the need for a multifacet struggl in all it dimens against the unit state wa repeatedli point out by the founder of the islam republ imam khomeyni mai hi soul be sanctifi and by ayatollah khamen i leader of the islam revolut but neither of them said that thi struggl should be carri out at a specif time and specif place basic speak our revolut is a popular revolut and when the muslim peopl of iran and the revolutionari strata especi the combat student despit their tast and polit platform want to work toward thi object a popular revolut within the framework of the recogn law and regul of the countri no obstacl should be rais for them in hi remark mr besharati list sever reason why the student ralli wa ban but none of these reason ar justifi either from the legal or revolutionari aspect 1 he said we disagre with the ralli that the ucb student had propos becaus we ar in favor of a show of uniti by our nation which can becom a power phenomenon that can prevent and thwart ani aggress or overt or covert intervent in thi societi and thi uniti thi wa the main reason for our disagr first of all the ralli that wa propos by the student wa not to take place parallel with the offici march that had been plan but two dai befor the offici march but where doe it sai that permiss should be grant for an express of avers to the unit state on a specif dai at a specif time and in a specif wai also the ucb is a student organ that is allow to oper on the basi of our islam countri s law and ralli can be held under ani circumst on ani dai and in ani form by request permiss from the interior minist provid that the ralli will not impair public order and secur in the countri and if the interior ministri as the executor of law and order feel that such a request would disrupt nation order and secur it should clearli state why it believ so there is no doubt that coordin uniti of method uniti of tast and so on ar posit and ideal point but the respons that the interior ministri ha is a legal respons on what point did the student request for permiss conflict with the recogn law of the interior ministri should a march against the unit state be held onli on a specif dai and under the supervis of on specif institut then what is the mean of the freedom to express on s view to protest and the freedom to hold legal demonstr is the interior ministri a legisl or polici make bodi or is it an executor of law if such issu were to be dealt with through such channel then the majl should have approv a law sai that demonstr against oppress and despot america should be carri out onli in an offici manner and through the channel of offici institut 2 the second reason which the esteem interior minist gave refer to a circular issu by the repres of the religi leader and the islam public coordin council s secretari that state that on the basi of the attach copi of circular no ellipsi as publish of the esteem presid the islam propaganda coordin council is in charg of organ and direct all public and offici ceremoni and ralli the ralli which the student want to hold wa not of thi natur a number of student an associ and a legal student format want to march and to demonstr thi could not be categor as an offici and public march that fall under the jurisdict of the countri s offici institut therefor it wa not correct to refer to thi circular if the ucb student had appli for permiss to organ an offici ceremoni on the nation level then natur thi circular would have appli and whether it is correct or not the interior ministri could have oppos it but in the student applic to the interior ministri there wa no sign of the student intent to hold an offici ralli at the nation level 3 anoth reason given by the esteem interior minist wa that it is not our duti to safeguard each person under ani circumst and to grant permiss and extend facil for ralli first of all if the request is legal and within the framework of state regul then on the basi of law the interior ministri should grant permiss and extend the necessari facil whether the interior minist like it or not secondli in thi countri with it muslim revolutionari and anti american peopl anti american demonstr and by muslim and commit student at that ar not danger danger eman onli from pro us element those who struggl against america do not fear the mentor of arrog thi remark by the interior minist mean that had the interior ministri not ensur secur the demonstr might have been attack and would not have been safe but it is clear that the devot iranian peopl have noth to fear that if there is insecur it is creat by the support of america and that it is the duti of the interior ministri to make the support of america feel insecur our peopl our student and our offici ar so broadmind that thei ar unaffect when thei hear what those who explicitli do not consid america to be an enemi and who want relat with it contrari to the thought of imam khomeyni mai hi soul be sanctifi and what the leader of the revolut ha so explicitli state but not onli do those who utter such word not feel ani insecur thei even resort to variou mean to express so call expert view on the topic now how can on accept a situat where certain peopl who without doubt ar muslim revolutionari and commit person and follow of the leader cannot express their opposit to america as thei wish or accept for thi wish of their to be consid as an act that spread discord in the nation rank and that their legal right be ignor while peopl like the esteem majl deputi raja i khorasani ar allow to speak without consid their own remark as be discord just as we believ that ani person whether a majl deputi or anyon els can sai what he want within the framework of hi belief ethic and the law and order of thi islam countri as long as he doe not insult or act against the interest of islam and of the countri and that he should not feel insecur in the same wai other too should be abl to enjoi these right of cours there ar also other point in mr besharati s remark which we will discuss at anoth time but the main point is that we should act within the framework of the system and of it law to preserv the right of the member of thi societi and thi is onli possibl when we do not mix person tast and assess with execut decis

situat rowhani if we want to compar our current posit in the region and in the world with our past posit i should sai that the islam republ of iran is the manifest of a well establish and strong countri and that it can be count on sinc it is a countri that remain steadfast on it holi revolutionari islam and nation aspir at a time when some countri chang their face each dai each hour and each month but the islam republ of iran ha shown that throughout the past 14 to 15 year it ha been abl to withstand all vicissitud the world ha realiz that we ar steadfast in our holi principl and aspir also we ar faith to our promis and our friendship with countri toward which we have extend our hand probabl some countri ar unabl to act with the same sincer when thei ar a target of onslaught but the islam republ of iran ha shown that it doe not fear such tempest in their extens propaganda the enemi of the islam republ of iran portrai iran as a countri seek an opportun to commit aggress against other countri and a countri seek to interfer in the domest affair of other but incid dure the past few year have fulli proven how baseless thi propaganda is the islam republ of iran is neither an aggressor and opportunist nor is it seek expansionist object and it is steadfast in the principl that it ha declar iran s patient and friendli attitud toward the develop in afghanistan which ha recent achiev it independ mai have been probabl surpris for the world howev despit it extens border with afghanistan iran did not interven in ani wai onli the envoi of the islam republ of iran ran from on street to anoth amid fire and blood try to establish a ceasefir and not to allow the flame of war to engulf the parti and group in that countri some of our diplomat were wound in thi process and some even face the danger of be martyr even in the difficult dai when mani peopl left kabul the polit envoi of the islam republ of iran stai on the same situat is true in our neighbor countri to the north in the azerbaijani armenian incid and in tajikistan the islam republ of iran show that it doe what it sai in the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia the islam republ of iran ha alwai tri to be a good mediat and to extinguish the flame of the war it ha never tri to exploit the situat in the sens that it ha never pursu it own interest the iraqi case is a clearer exampl thi wa a case of a countri that had fought against us for eight year a countri that had perpetr a seri of crime against our nation and a countri that confront kuwait which had commit so much treason against our peopl dure the iran iraq war but iran accept refuge from both countri with open arm we accept about 1 2 or 1 3 million iraqi and ten of thousand of kuwaiti when all border delin had been upset there were no border and we had a free hand to do what we want but we did not enter iraq i think that the incid and develop that took place around us make all those in the world who ar clever and calcul despit the propaganda that thei dissemin against us realiz the truth i think that in recent year the islam republ of iran ha fulli proven it islam and humanitarian natur to the world i consid the posit of the islam republ of iran in the world to be extrem good all the hue and cry start by the american cannot convinc their friend to sever their relat with iran or to stop help iran thi is import and more import still we see how under such condit when all thi commot is go on against the islam republ of iran europ japan and other have healthi polit and econom relat with the islam republ of iran it is onli natur for them not to want to leav a countri that want to live independ under the current world condit and a third world countri in such a sensit area of the world at that to be in peac but fortun dure the past 14 to 15 year we have shown that we ar complet resist and that we ar veri us to plot and to thwart and confront such plot other too have come to know us veri well of cours i think that thi is the first time in histori that the world is see iran as it is todai befor thi iran wa alwai known as a countri that wa outwardli independ but inwardli under the domin of other and it wa either the british the russian or the american who domin it but the fulli independ face of the islam republ of iran is a face that wa seen after the victori of the islam revolut and it wa the face of uniti in the religi and polit manag of the countri until the victori of the islam revolut and especi dure the pahlavi dynasti these two manag were alwai in confront dure the qajar and safavid dynasti the situat wa differ in other word at some junctur in histori there ha been a close between these two manag but dure the pahlavi dynasti the polit manag wa in total confront with the religi manag the revolut wa the first time that the countri had wit the uniti of these two and thi is extrem import sinc we see that the same person who is the polit head of the countri is also the religi head in other word the issu of the suprem leader is an extrem signific issu that ha been stabil in our countri and that our peopl have wholeheartedli and sincer accept the west think that iranian accept imam khomeyni but that thei do not accept the suprem leader howev thing were later clarifi and the world saw that the iranian accept both imam khomeyni and the suprem leader todai therefor a suprem leader will alwai exist imam khomeyni mai hi soul be sanctifi stood out at on time in histori and we benefit from the light that he shed of cours we will alwai make us of the moral light that the late leader shed on us but hi physic presenc wa onli for a while howev a suprem leader will alwai exist therefor the unit manag in the islam countri ha given the islam world the opportun for the ruler to stand next to the peopl passag omit whether the world want it or not the islam republ of iran rule the heart of the peopl throughout the world thi is not like the alleg world leadership of america which accept onli itself the american alleg leadership but thei ar the onli on who accept thi it ha been prove that thei ar not the leader of the world but that the islam republ of iran is undoubtedli the leader of million throughout the world and it doe not make ani differ if these countri ar near us or not our influenc in countri far from us is bigger than our influenc on our neighbor countri the influenc that we have in algeria over the heart of the peopl in egypt despit their distanc from us and the influenc that we have on muslim in the far east in africa and in the american contin mai be greater than the influenc that we have on muslim in our neighbor countri therefor thi is a moral and genuin influenc thi is in answer to the first part of your question on how we should view the islam republ of iran at thi junctur in histori i think that iran should be regard as a power as an independ countri as a countri where religion and polit and peopl and offici ar in full coordin as a countri that doe not intend to commit aggress as a peac seek countri as a countri that doe not intend to occupi anoth countri as a countri that is fulli faith to it aspir and slogan and as a countri whose word can be trust todai there is no other countri but iran in the world that portrai such a pictur in answer to the second part of your question on how we see the world and the new world order i think that we should expect mani develop in the come year it mai seem that differ stem from the exist of two superpow in the world mai have end and that it is the era of a new order where there will no longer be a threat of war and where peac and justic will reign but thi is not so in other word we have not onli not seen a reduct in region war and clash but we have also seen the occup of on countri by anoth dure thi era of the new order in other word it wa dure the era of the new order that iraq attack devour and annex anoth countri if thi new order did not exist such thing might never have happen we mai not have had the war that we see in europ todai a clear exampl of which is bosnia herzegovina as well as the ethnic war that we have wit it is not as though we can sai that what we see todai is a world of peac of tranquil and of a unipolar system none of these have been fulfil and i think that thei will never be fulfil the incid in the soviet union as publish show the western that thei cannot make a clear judgment of what will happen in that countri in the recent elect there we saw how those who put forth extrem ultranationalist slogan and spoke about the peopl s nation pride got a higher number of vote even though their slogan ar danger the major of the peopl vote in favor of them the elect in the soviet union as publish were not a simpl issu it wa someth that mai have complet shaken the west and made them realiz that thei cannot be veri confid that the issu of a soviet superpow ha end onc and for all i think that new pole ar be form in the world we see that the thought that in the new world order there would be onli on pole where the american would be abl to act as the world leader and do as thei pleas ha not materi i think that in the come year and especi in the begin of the new centuri that you refer to we will wit mani rapid and import develop as to what element will plai a role in these develop i can list technolog as on of the most import element of cours refer can also be made to economi but econom develop mai also be the result of modern technolog the issu of technolog is extrem import in other word technolog develop mai make countri superior to the current power and mai lead to a complet chang in the world situat the world s militari situat mai also chang becaus of technolog develop of cours there ar other import element in the world i think that the most import element that can influenc the futur of the world is economi in it gener sens which also includ technolog and scienc and cultur which includ ideolog and religion other develop such as militari polit and social aspect will all be offshoot of these in todai s world technolog and scientif develop ar extrem rapid and aw inspir the same appli to cultur develop thi veri issu of the reviv of religi thought throughout the world is an extrem import issu the forecast in the world wa that by the end of the current centuri there would be no such thing as religion but todai we see how at the end of thi centuri religi thought ha been reviv and how the situat now cannot be compar even with the situat at the begin of the current centuri we will definit wit the further expans of such develop in the next centuri i think that the basi of the world s futur develop will be economi and cultur and the american will not have the first sai in either of these two field possibl as far as japan germani and so on ar concern we can sai that thei will plai the number on role in the futur economi but as far as cultur is concern we think that islam will be consid an extrem import and great cultur power becaus we ar now wit the dawn of islam the rai of islam will undoubtedli spread in the next few year and at the begin of the new centuri we will wit new cultur develop under the aegi of these rai majl va pazhuhesh your excel s refer to technolog and econom develop call for discuss the fact that energi ha been gradual plai a stronger role in geopolit develop for the past decad how do you assess thi element and how long do you think thi develop will last rowhani energi will plai an extrem import role of cours a special period start in the world after 1973 thi period concentr on wai to replac oil with other energi much work ha been done on thi and now 20 year later with the advanc technolog that man ha at hi dispos we should have wit mani rapid and profound develop but we have not moreov oil is now consid the commod that is the sourc of mani extens develop in the variou field now we even see that aircraft manufactur with composit preced word in english ar stronger than aircraft manufactur with special steel therefor in the futur of industri and economi oil will maintain it special place i think that the situat that the west head by america ha creat for oil todai is not onli treason against the oil export countri but treason against all mankind in other word we ar offer the world s most valuabl commod which is also veri limit at extrem low price we ar burn and destroi thi commod and thi is treason against the futur of mankind it is the american and the rest of the big western power who should be answer to histori for thi treason it is within the context of the signific of energi or of black gold that iran and basic speak the persian gulf find it special role it is becaus of thi role that in the come centuri mani of the countri that ar not oil export will not onli not be export thei will also have to becom import in the come decad it is possibl that there will not be a commod known as north sea oil of cours some opinion ar that the north sea oil reserv will end much sooner possibl in the first year of the next centuri we will reach a situat in which not onli will the persian gulf be the sole export of oil in the world but saudi arabia too will be an oil superpow follow by other countri such as iran iraq kuwait and so on and will be abl to export oil and ga the largest ga resourc ar in thi area perhap the increas presenc of foreign power and their arm in thi region is becaus of the energi issu but we should also be wise in preserv thi valuabl energi resourc the majl and the govern should make plan and not allow thi major asset to be wast we should have correct program at home the majl research center should studi wai that we can econom in energi consumpt as far as the world is concern the energi problem and especi the problem of oil will undoubtedli not lose it import for year to come majl va pazhuhesh the esteem leader s emphasi on relat with america show that the system strongli reject polit relat with america from the point of view of slogan what polit and ideolog logic do you have to offer in justif of thi polici rowhani becaus of it histor ideolog and religi root the issu of america is of special import to our countri first of all when we look at histori we see that from it outset the islam revolut wa a struggl against foreign and specif american coloni in tandem with a struggl against domest coloni passag omit therefor we see that the struggl against america from the veri first year of thi movement wa the pivot and major slogan on the other hand the american too plai a major role in crush the revolut we see how at the peak of the revolut the american gener huyser person came to iran in a bid to crush and to destroi the revolut of cours we knew all these thing at that time and the fact that the shah had plan engin by the american and especi aim at confront the revolut and islam ha becom clearer now in hi famou speech at the feyziyeh school which spark off the 1342 1963 movement and the 5 june 1963 incid hi emin the imam mai hi soul be sanctifi told the shah don t do whatev the american dictat to you at least think and see what thei ar dictat to you therefor we see that thi movement which wa a struggl against america from the veri start led to the victori of the revolut after which the american embassi s plot start thi wa follow by the occup of the nest of espionag and the revel of document for the world to see how from the veri outset the american were work toward defeat the revolut and overthrow the system now too wherev there is a plot against iran against the system of the islam republ against the revolut and against the islam movement in the world be it in algeria egypt or anywher els where an islam movement is seen we see how the american plai the main role in suppress it thu the issu of the peopl s enmiti with america is both a matter of histori and revolut and of slogan and religion the american have alwai oppos islam thought and islam movement thi opposit and confront continu todai too the imam mai hi soul be sanctifi veri clearli specifi the pivot slogan of struggl against america of cours it is true that we did not sever our polit relat with america and that it wa the american who sever their relat with us but the imam state hi satisfact at thi what did we need these relat for in other word even though the american start everyth both the imam and the peopl welcom it throughout thi period the american have not decreas their enmiti even for on dai thei have frozen our asset but what we ow them compar with our frozen asset wa minim therefor the american have resort to variou mean to express their overt hostil toward us and when thei have enter a war against us with such hostil feel what reason is there for us to propound the issu of relat with america in such an atmospher basic it is not correct to propound thi issu at all at thi junctur in histori i think that the esteem leader s remark on 4 novemb thi year the anniversari of the occup of the us embassi were extrem sagaci he clearli state all the reason and logic behind hi view reason why we should not establish relat with america have alwai been list but it wa necessari to clarifi them and to give the reason why our activ should be base on our nation and islam interest what benefit will our approach the unit state or our establish relat with it have it is extrem simplemind to think that our problem exist becaus we have no relat with america and that if we establish relat these problem would be solv undoubtedli in our relat with america we would suffer much harm and it cannot be proven that such relat would reap even on of the benefit that it is said thei would yield especi with america s current foreign polici in the clinton era basic speak america s foreign polici is veri sick becaus of their mani blatant mistak and extrem childish behavior the secretari of state and the nation secur council of america ar in a shaki posit the american do mani ridicul and childish thing and sai that thei want to behav with iran in the same wai that thei behav with the iraqi and that just as thei exert pressur on iraq thei will put pressur on iran sai such thing is extrem childish and thoughtless and show that basic speak american foreign polici is sick and unabl to analyz world issu therefor at a time when america is our enemi and doe not hide it enmiti and at a time when our peopl have alwai been harm and harass by america rapproch with america will definit be to our detriment the american violent treatment of a coupl of our navi offic on board iran ajr the down of the iranair airbu the destruct of the salman oil platform the taba incid and so on all speak of america s violent and pitiless action for us the american enmiti ha been obviou from the taba incid to the down of our plane and to it action todai i think that the american ar pitiless and illog enemi and that rapproch with them will definit be to our detriment moreov basic it is up to the esteem leader to delin and to determin the major and principl polici of the countri and the system and he ha veri explicitli state that we have noth to gain from relat with america and that such relat ar harm to us i should also add that some peopl think that the entir world is friend with america and that the onli countri in the world that is america s enemi is the islam republ of iran or that all countri in the world ar in love with america and that it is onli the islam republ of iran that detest it and with thi type of assess thei ask how can america which is love by everyon be detest by you but i think that thi is not so america ha extrem strong militari econom ideolog and cultur enemi in the world and of cours at the top of the list of america s militari enemi despit everyth that is be said and despit the express of friendship is russia there ar also china and franc from the econom aspect america confront japan and germani and from the ideolog and cultur aspect it is confront the islam republ of iran and revolutionari islam therefor we can sai that the american have mani enemi all the nation in the world ar the enemi of america the third world is america s enemi actual there ar sever superpow that ar confront america the militari superpow in the form of russia china and franc the econom superpow in the form of japan and germani and so on and the cultur superpow in the form of the islam republ therefor it is not as though everyon els except us is america s friend the tone that the other us mai be differ from our thei mai speak in a diplomat manner or hide some of their intent but our posit is clear and explicit majl va pazhuhesh the truth is that the islam republ s foreign polici ha not fluctuat so much after the format of the suprem nation secur council snsc pleas tell us about the process that led to the creation and to the continu exist of thi council what role it plai in variou develop and what it ha been abl to achiev rowhani i think that an institut known as the snsc is among the bless that were bestow on us with the latest direct that were issu by hi emin the imam mai hi soul be sanctifi and which wa creat with the revis of the constitut actual mani countri feel the need for a nation secur council after a period of war or militari conflict dure the war we had a suprem nation defens council but we had to rapidli form anoth council known as the suprem war support council so that it could fill the vacuum that exist with the absenc of a nation secur council after the war the need for a central institut in which politician and militari offici could sit next to each other and adopt or coordin militari and polit decis wa tangibl felt on the other hand it wa necessari for the head of the three power to sit down togeth and to coordin decis in the constitut befor it revis the presid wa the coordin of these three power howev no mechan on how to coordin the three had been envisag in the constitut but in the current constitut thi coordin ha been creat with the emerg of a new institut in the form of the snsc in short we can sai that in the snsc defens or polit decis or in other word militari and state decis on the on hand and the decis by the three power on the other ar coordin and import issu that ar connect with our nation secur be thei polit militari law enforc intellig econom cultur or other issu ar discuss and decid upon in the snsc the head of the three power two repres of the esteem leader and three polit secur minist such as the interior foreign affair and inform minist ar present also the command in chief who is the highest rank militari offici as well as the head of the plan and budget organ who is actual the coordin of the countri s economi ar also present occasion other minist ar invit to particip when the topic to be discuss requir their presenc thi council wa effect in end the differ between iran and iraq at that junctur and in free the prison of war as well as in settl the issu of the part of our border still under iraqi occup the famou letter that were exchang between the iranian presid and saddam husayn were letter that had been discuss by the snsc these letter were extrem effect and import the decis that the snsc adopt dure iraq s war against kuwait were extrem import also the decis that the snsc adopt vi a vi the disintegr of the soviet union were also veri import i should point out that the snsc had foreseen the disintegr of the soviet union at least two year befor it took place and had actual conclud how mani countri the soviet union would be split into and what stanc we should adopt toward it it had even foreseen the plot that the western and especi the american want to hatch in thi region as mani as three year befor and had foreseen that world arrog would on dai provok some in the area to confront iran s territori integr of cours it is necessari to explain that the snsc discuss and deliber becom valuabl when thei ar also endors by the esteem leader in which case thei ar implement as a compulsori decis i think that thi institut ha been veri favor for the islam republ of iran
