LA122490-0040: cancer and power line an uncertain connect health a 1979 studi link magnet field with childhood diseas but the issu is far from settl when a 1979 studi indic that childhood cancer rate were higher in famili live near high current electr power line scorn util offici and mani scientist insist that electromagnet field from power line couldn t possibl affect human health but a follow up studi support the find conclud that children live near high current line were 1 5 to 2 time more like than other to get cancer other studi have found that worker in electr job such as util linemen power station oper and electrician have higher rate for brain cancer leukemia and lymphoma the same cancer implic in the childhood studi still the issu is far from settl there ar ambigu in much of the research and other studi have found no link between ill and electr and magnet em field nor doe anyon know the mechan by which these field even weak on mai caus harm the controversi is especi perplex becaus few thing seem more benign or indispens than electr and it is hard for some scientist to envis demon lurk in electr wire robert adair a yale univers physic professor and lead doubter said investig the effect of em field is like look for werewolv when someon tell you a leaf fell on an eleph and broke hi back you re skeptic he said nevertheless a grow number of lawmak and even util execut ar call for more research on potenti health effect and wai to reduc exposur and what began as concern about power line now includ electr blanket and video displai termin which also expos user to em field amid the uncertainti some expert ar advoc prudent avoid or limit exposur to field in cheap and simpl wai the issu is creat concern in commun throughout the countri where the mere suggest

distribut station like the on the lo angel depart of water and power want to build in arleta in a draft report releas earlier thi month the us environment protect agenc describ field from power line and perhap other sourc in the home as a possibl but not proven caus of cancer in human the epa and other feder health agenc have been critic for invest too littl in em health research much of which is fund by util cite auster budget and other prioriti the epa drop it own research program a few year ago the situat is pathet said dr david o carpent dean of the school of public health at the state univers of new york at albani i think there realli ar some hazard here but the feder govern ha simpli not been a player of ani major import other expert sai that the risk if there is on seem small compar to hazard like cigarett alcohol and asbesto childhood cancer for exampl is mercifulli rare strike about on child in 10 000 per year if as some studi suggest the risk doubl for children live near high current line the risk climb to two chanc in 10 000 even with such slim odd howev em field could emerg as on of societi s more signific involuntari risk carpent former head of a new york state program of em field research ha estim that field could account for 20 to 30 of childhood cancer or up to 2 000 per year as well as 4 000 adult cancer annual in the unit state the stake ar realli high on thi ken henderson director of complianc for the california public util commiss recent told a meet of util offici if damag ar prove he said societi increasingli demand that someon pai and util ar seen as have the deepest pocket around util do not look forward to the prospect of retrofit the nation s electr power grid which some sai would reduc the problem at a cost in the billion of dollar i think in hindsight we should have come in with more research monei sooner said jack sahl senior research scientist with southern california edison but it s not like the health depart were sai that we ought to be realli push thi hard the press also paid less attent to thi than to other cancer scare a lot of thi inform isn t that new but the institut in societi that would normal warn you about thi haven t said loui slesin editor of the microwav new a newslett that provid steadi coverag of the issu human have alwai been expos to electromagnet energi from the earth s static magnet field to

affect live cell in onli two wai either by ioniz or heat tissu as microwav do sinc field induc in the bodi by power line and applianc ar weaker than field produc by the bodi itself thei were thought to have no biolog effect howev by the 1970s some scientist had demonstr chang in the function of cell expos to low frequenc field and from eastern europ came report of stress and sexual dysfunct among worker at electr power switchyard but the watersh wa the 1979 studi indic a higher rate of childhood cancer in home near high current power line the denver base studi wa done by nanci wertheim and ed leeper a pair of obscur research work with their own fund it wa a joke between us for quit a long time said wertheim ad that she and leeper spent two year befor we publish try to make the find go awai becaus we thought it wa an accid somehow nine year later a second denver studi led by epidemiologist david savitz found childhood cancer rate were 1 5 to 2 time abov averag for children live near high current line meanwhil em field were implic in variou occup studi for exampl a 1982 usc studi found that white male in lo angel counti with electr occup had leukemia rate 29 abov averag the same year a studi found that leukemia mortal in washington state from 1950 through 1979 wa 37 higher than averag among worker in electr occup a 1988 studi found that util worker in east texa were 13 time more like to develop brain tumor than other worker a 1989 studi in lo angel counti found rate of astrocytoma a type of brain cancer were 4 3 time greater for men with over five year in electr work and 10 time greater for those with more than 10 year of experi anoth studi ha found elev cancer rate in the children of worker in electr occup suggest that field mai affect the sperm mani applianc gener strong em field but in most case the us is sporad and field strength drop sharpli with distanc but electr blanket can expos user to high field for hour at a time a studi publish last mai found higher cancer rate among children whose mother us electr blanket dure pregnanc an earlier studi link electr blanket us dure pregnanc to higher risk of miscarriag two more studi found no link between electr blanket us and leukemia and testicular cancer respect anoth studi found no connect between em field and an acut form of leukemia the ubiquit video displai termin ha also stir concern becaus it expos user to field that ar weak yet of similar strength to those implic in the childhood cancer studi a 1988 studi found higher rate of miscarriag and birth defect among northern california women who us comput termin more than 20 hour per week dure their first trimest of pregnanc other studi conclud that vdt ar probabl safe to us dure pregnanc in the laboratori scientist have shown that em field alter basic cellular function like protein synthesi and product of hormon involv in immun respons some have theoriz that field creat weak current around cell membran that alter biochem signal possibl interf with the cancer fight function of the immun system there is a bodi of laboratori evid there is a bodi of epidemiolog evid and the two ar come togeth in a veri remark wai said dr w ross adei associ chief of staff at the petti memori veteran administr medic center in loma linda other sai that overst the case thei point to contradictori studi that found no elev cancer risk with em field as well as flaw in studi that suggest a link for exampl most of these studi includ few if ani measur to show that worker and children live near power line actual had higher exposur the savitz find in denver illustr some of the difficulti in interpret the research hi childhood cancer data not onli indic a link with power line but with matern smoke failur of mother to breast feed and higher auto traffic near the home if there is a hazard reduc it will be a daunt task in gener exposur from power line can be lessen by rais tower height and expand right of wai or by phase line arrai them in such a wai that field cancel each other howev field strength mai also depend on wire and the wai the power is ground in the home and it s uncertain what aspect of field should be control whether the risk would be in magnet or electr field or both and result from chronic exposur to weak field or transient peak in field strength consequ util offici and electron manufactur contend that regul ar prematur i understand we ar all under tremend pressur from our custom and our client to do someth even if it s wrong said kirbi c holt a consult scientist with southern california edison we simpli don t know what to regul and whatev we do we will probabl be wrong given all the opportun to be wrong current three state ar sponsor em field research includ a three year 2 million program in california no
