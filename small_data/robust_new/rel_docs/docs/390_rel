in order to quickli and appropri cope with the chang result from both these need and seed a convent central administr alon is inadequ in the fight against cancer cardiovascular diseas and incur diseas it is becom essenti for the mhw to implement it s t administr in a unitari and across the board fashion in order to cope with such a state of affair the mhw set up the health scienc divis which handl the overal coordin and effici execut of the mhw s t measur the fy93 budget need to promot these s t measur is 64 343 billion which is an increas of 3 005 billion 4 9 over the fy92 budget b health scienc confer in promot health scienc a basic strategi must be establish and studi must be conduct on set futur orient prioriti research topic that ar base on that strategi then becaus there ar also field of health scienc that involv bioethic safeti and other such delic problem the health scienc confer were set up in novemb 1986 as round tabl discuss with the minist of health and welfar at the

LA040990-0066: column on rethink prioriti on aid the infect that prei on those with damag immun system have been target of littl interest to research the emphasi ha been on find a cure for the syndrom a recent intern confer on the statu of aid drug research here drew an overflow crowd of hundr of medic profession but by the final morn s session on devot to the infect that prei on peopl with immun system laid wast by aid the hall wa virtual empti i expect it said john mcgowan associ director for basic research and develop for the aid divis of the nation institut for allergi and infecti diseas the lead feder agenc in aid research it didn t surpris me at all throughout the scientif commun there ha been littl in the wai of basic laboratori work or clinic studi toward find or test treatment for the opportunist infect that plagu and eventu kill most peopl with aid and attract research to the area ha been a continu problem the lack of activ reflect a belief held by most of those do major aid research that the greatest advanc will come from develop drug for the viru that caus acquir immun defici syndrom rather than from drug to treat each infect that accompani the underli condit thu there ha been a full court press to discov and studi antivir drug but far less interest in find treatment for the virul form of cancer mening pneumonia and other infect that strike aid patient but that attitud is reject by those who ar infect or ill for them the most press and immedi concern is to surviv with aid as long as possibl by defeat each infect that develop if you can give us two more year you ll have two more year where you can find your cure said mark harrington of the organ act up aid coalit to unleash power the situat also frustrat primari care physician who ar on the front line treat aid patient and the nation institut for allergi and infecti diseas niaid which recent initi a major push to ignit interest in the opportunist infect arena there is no question we need to do more said dr anthoni s fauci niaid director and the feder govern s director of aid research activ from a scientif viewpoint it s obvious much more interest and excit to do the antivir work fauci said but you also must address the problem of what you do for those peopl who ar alreadi infect and whose immun system have deterior thi is an issu of major public health import expert sai there ar mani reason work in thi field ha been move so slowli first thei sai few known drug ar effect against mani of these infect which ar rare in peopl with healthi immun system further too few basic laboratori scientist or pharmaceut compani ar interest in look for new drug the number of diseas involv complic the search and drug manufactur often perceiv the potenti market to be quit small and not worth the effort where do the new drug molecul come from thei come from laboratori or compani that get excit about thi kind of research said dr daniel hoth director of the aid divis of niaid hoth said research in academia will get excit about test these drug in human if thei sens the challeng is doabl but the major problem is that there aren t a lot of drug out there the fundament issu is that we need to find new molecul research also note that it would be discourag to conquer on infect with a drug that is avail now onli to have an infect of a differ natur strike in it stead we need to put peopl with aid into remiss by find a wai to restor their damag immun system said dr robert t schoolei an aid research at harvard univers and massachusett gener hospit until that happen schoolei said each successfulli treat infect will add a littl bit to life expect but in a lot of wai it s just exchang on caus of death for anoth i wish life were simpl enough to believ that treat the opportunist infect would make the diseas go awai but it isn t he liken the situat to leukemia year ago befor therapi were found to place that diseas into remiss those afflict with leukemia also were vulner to life threaten infect as the antibiot got better we were abl to keep peopl aliv longer he said but unless we were abl to put the leukemia into remiss and have the immun system return the patient would all die of infect anywai in aid the tempo is slower but the process is the same nevertheless there ha been at least on dramat instanc of a drug alreadi in us demonstr a signific abil to extend the live of aid patient that drug is pentamidin us to treat pneumocysti carinii pneumonia which wa kill aid patient with brutal swift a group of san francisco physician show that it can stave off even a first episod of pneumocysti carinii when it is taken in aerosol form as a prevent measur and now virtual all individu infect with the human immunodefici viru hiv whose immun system have begun to show sign of seriou deterior place them at great risk of develop pneumocysti ar advis to take aerosol pentamidin that wa a major breakthrough said harrington of act up it refut the whole argument that we can realli save live onli by treat primari hiv niaid recogn that too littl attent ha been paid to opportunist infect recent initi sever effort in the area the agenc plan to sponsor a drug discoveri group with the singl goal of look for new drug such group have been oper in the antivir area sinc 1986 typic a group involv a partnership of academia industri and govern draw upon the resourc of dozen of drug compani and about 100 differ institut the agenc ha slate 3 million thi year for the work on opportunist infect should we discov a compound that look promis then we will have the capabl to develop it and bring it into human trial mcgowan said and the agenc s commun base aid research program which involv primari care physician who treat aid patient within the next few month plan to begin trial of known drug to determin if thei could be us to prevent ani of the opportunist infect the physician ar eager to particip in thi overlook aspect of aid research said dr lawrenc deyton director of the program the most import thing on their mind is how do i keep my patient aliv longer deyton said unlik academ research who ar primarili concern with the behavior of the viru and how it affect the work of the immun system doctor in our program ar primari care provid deyton said the scientif question thei ar go to ask ar go to be of primari clinic concern thei re ask differ kind of question in a differ set he said these doc ar differ in their emot makeup deyton ad thei re not as interest in publish or in win the nobel prize for them the reward ar truli exhilar when thei can make these littl inroad deyton said that the first trial will seek to find a wai of prevent toxoplasmosi in the brain a life threaten parasit infect seen with increas frequenc in aid patient as with other opportunist infect mani peopl ar expos to the organ that caus toxoplasmosi but onli those with damag immun system becom ill other who have been expos to the parasit have develop antibodi to it the trial will seek to identifi those at risk and to administ them low dose of those drug usual us to treat the diseas after it develop if thi turn out to be effect we re go to be spare a lot of peopl a veri seriou infect deyton said similar trial will try to prevent mycobacterium avium or mai a tuberculosi like condit that frequent strike in the later stage of aid it is a frequent caus of death and disabl in aid patient and is difficult to treat there s a certain pessim about mai becaus we ve known about the organ for a long time but it ha so far resist effort to find a meaning therapi even befor hiv

thei point to sever recent instanc in which promis aid drug have appear safe in earli human test but prove more toxic after be given to larger number of peopl thei ar also concern about potenti
