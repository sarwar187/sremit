receiv mar 10 93 text the fate of the futur of everi peopl depend on their natur and social characterist and the total of extern effect the natur foundat of a popul is repres by the gene pool which is the basi of popul integr and stabil as well as of it function and develop the condit of the gene pool is determin both by intern law and extern effect of ecolog factor it is well known that a joint action of genet mechan and ecolog factor caus around 60 of the total amount of damag of popul condit and health howev in ukrain a certain asymmetri in attent given to these two compon ha form while wide circl of scientist and public have express steadfast and strong interest in the ecolog compon the genet compon is draw attent of veri few research profession so the real contribut of genet mechan to health condit of the popul ha not yet becom the subject of modern wide scale theoret and appli studi howev it is clear that the nearest futur of ukrain s popul depend to a larg extent on time and complex solut of the gene pool problem to make thi statement not just clear intuit but also well reason we shall turn now to well known fact 1 sinc 1989 the reproduct of ukrain s popul ha been decreas and there is a danger of it depopul mortal ha surpass the birth rate 1 2 accord to minstat the ministri of statist of ukrain the index of natur reduct of ukrain s popul wa 39147 peopl in 1991 and 96861 in 1992 at the same time the reproduct rate for the number of girl born per woman who have reach 15 year of ag and ha drop below on to 0 976 1 2 in the last decad the frequenc of hypotrophi among the newborn ha increas fivefold and the frequenc of genet disturb nativ development defect spontan miscarriag and psychic diseas ha also increas 46 of high school student suffer from variou chronic diseas and on out of two ha morpholog and function disturb onli 5 to 8 of high school graduat can be consid healthi 1 3 thu danger trend of increas reproduct loss of and genet load in ukrain s

five to twentyfold ground is be chemic poison and 3 billion cubic meter of pollut sewag ar dischargedt annual into the environ 4 the chemic load on the gene pool is increas due to the effect of the chernobyl catastroph in recent year the number of certain oncolog hematolog and endocrin diseas ha increas while the overal level of immun protect in peopl ha decreas especi in those who had been subject to the effect of chernobyl radiat factor 3 a number of infect especi such as chlamidios mycoplasmos ureoplasmos as well as gelmintos and viru carri have a neg effect on the gene pool 4 ukrain ha a rel high level of a number of hereditari diseas and nativ development defect and due to the extrem low avail of diagnost mean and medic thei have an especi high neg effect on the gene pool 5 the multin and multiethn charact of ukrain s popul is the result of the complic histori of the peopl who for mani centuri ha been divid among sever state and affect by intern and extern migrat of larg popul mass the 1932 1933 famin substanti loss dure wwii and other factor thi is why the gene pool of ukrain s popul and her region and ethnic format requir that a differenti popul genet research be conduct the abov circumst as well as other circumst that have not been list make it possibl to conclud that the question is not onli preserv but also protect of ukrain s gene pool appar it is necessari to have a thoroughli thought over and carefulli work out program of scientif studi and practic action the main idea in develop a program to protect the gene pool of ukrain s popul is the understand of it urgenc by a group of scientist and by the health ministri manag and take into account certain work perform in thi area and the avail personnel and materi and technic potenti a group of scientist had been develop the program in the 1980s but it onli becam possibl to develop a complet project in 1990 1991 the concept of the program is base on the fact that problem of legisl medic scientif personnel econom and organiz support must be solv in an integr manner with a clear definit of the work scope and stage the program ha been develop for a five year period and count on particip of research from variou field of biolog and medic scienc and medic genet servic practition all program provis were center around the follow conceptu compon 1 studi the statu of the gene pool of ukrain

breakthrough in the most advanc defens technolog 3 success develop of the nuclear power torpedo submarin the develop of the guid missil nuclear submarin wa approv by the central committe in june 1958 a 3 year effort produc some initi result in the hull design and in the nuclear power plant in march 1963 the central special committe decid to put the project on hold becaus of temporari difficulti in the nation economi and a lack of research resourc howev a portion of the research effort wa retain to work on technolog breakthrough in the mid 1960s the nation economi improv and the central special committe decid in march 1965 to reinstat the project as a nation project and to launch a full scale r d effort it also ask the second ministri of machin build to complet a land base reactor by 1970 as an intermedi step toward a nuclear power submarin the approach wa to verifi the nuclear reactor first on land and then to instal it on the submarin in order to shorten the develop time for the complic technolog of guid missil nuclear submarin the central special committe decid in august of the same year that there would be two phase in the develop the first step wa to develop a nuclear torpedo submarin and to solv major technolog problem of a nuclear power submarin and an anti submarin torpedo the second step would be to develop a guid missil nuclear submarin and to solv the kei technolog for a submarin to land guid missil and it launch system the central special committe further decid that the first nuclear torpedo submarin should have it maiden voyag in 1972 the submarin should meet all the major tactic requir so that it could be deliv to the navi as a warship the central special committe demand a cooper and coordin effort from the particip depart and committe of the state

establish nuclear scienc and technolog china also began a survei of uranium resourc under the leadership of deputi minist liu jie 0149 2638 of the ministri of geologi prepar for the mine of uranium began in februari 1954 from june to octob 1954 geologist gao zhizhang 7559 0037 2627 and other survei haicheng in liaon and fuzhong and shanmuchong in guangxi where uranium wa discov befor the new china thei brought back uranium or sampl from shanmuchong these find receiv the attent of mao zedong and zhou enlai who were quickli brief by liu jie mao said we ar veri hope there ar bound to be uranium mine we onli have to look for them after accomplish some preliminari achiev in nuclear technolog and make some discoveri in uranium mine the chines communist parti held an expand meet of it central secretariat on 15 januari 1955 in thi meet chair by mao zedong a polici wa formul to develop china s atom energi that decis mark the begin of china s nuclear industri and nuclear weapon develop on 20 januari an agreement wa sign by china and the soviet union to conduct a joint survei of uranium deposit in china in april the state council decid to establish a third bureau of the ministri of geologi under the third offic of the state council lei rongtian 7191 2837 1131 wa name bureau chief in charg of all geolog effort relat to uranium mine in china also uranium geolog survei team such as the hunan 309 team and the xinjiang 519 team were form with peopl draft from relev depart region and arm servic in china the draft order came from the parti central committe the state council and the central militari commiss under the organ of the third bureau of the ministri of geologi and the advic of the soviet expert the geolog survei team found a larg number of radiat anomali includ 11 site worthi of further investig the survei effort and industri evalu continu and the first uranium reserv data were report to the state by 1960 there were eight mine site for uranium and the first set of uranium mine requir wa satisfi as china wa plan it first batch of uranium mine process plant and nuclear fuel plant it wa face with a question how largeshould the nuclear industri be in earli 1957 zhou enlai point out that china should have it own nuclear industri system and it own nuclear forc howev the problem wa to go from have not to have so the scale should not be too larg base on thi the third ministri of machin build re evalu the plan in the china soviet agreement and felt that the scale of the plan wa too big after repeat studi and to satisfi the requir of maintain a complet set of nuclear industri thei propos a smaller but complet plan the size of the uranium concentr plant wa greatli reduc and invest wa reduc by 40 percent the new propos suit the chines situat better and wa approv by the parti central committe and the state council anoth import issu in china s nuclear industri develop wa how to implement the polici of mainli self reliant but strive for extern assist in the 1959 movement of technolog innov and revolut some peopl want to improv the technolog by revis the soviet plant design and the design of instrument and meter minist song renqiong 1345 01717 4522 report thi situat to mao zedong in a letter mao s comment wa let us learn how to walk befor we learn how to run base on thi the second ministri of machin build urg all the technic worker to patient learn from the soviet expert and to understand the soviet technolog it wa emphas that no revis were permit befor master the soviet technolog and equip and instrument suppli by the soviet union were not to be modifi or dismantl in case where the soviet technolog did not suit the chines situat necessari improv were made onli after experiment research and with the approv of the soviet expert the state council also decid that when equip and raw materi could be found in china thei should be suppli domest an effort wa made to produc special equip in china thu creat the abil to design and manufactur the need equip the construct of the atom energi institut wa acceler and special research organ for uranium mine geologi and uranium or refin were establish the initi of the research personnel wa fulli mobil and self relianc wa enhanc in the nationwid great leap forward movement there were instanc of push safeti and qualiti asid in the pursuit of product and construct schedul for such behavior the second ministri of machin build took a firm stand and clearli side with qualiti and safeti construct not meet qualiti standard had to be bulldoz and rebuilt deputi minist in charg of capit construct liu wei inde led the destruct of substandard build and start construct all over again thi rigor attitud got the attent of the construct unit and ensur the qualiti of construct in the build up of the nuclear industri china properli handl the issu of self relianc outsid assist construct scope and nation resourc the correct polici and practic led to veri good result in august 1960 uranium mine in chenxian counti and hengshan dapu in hunan and shengyao in jiangxi were near complet the uranium process plant in hengyang hunan began instal equip the lanzhou uranium enrich plant wa partial equip and the associ civil construct for the atom enterpris in qiuchuan gansu and the fuel element plant in baotou inner mongolia were also near complet the success build up of the nuclear industri made the develop of nuclear weapon possibl section 2 develop of the first atom bomb to speed up the pace of nuclear weapon develop china activ sought help from the soviet union the agreement on new defensetechnolog sign by china and the soviet union contain an articl state that the soviet union would help china develop it nuclear weapon the implement of thi agreement wa rel smooth in the begin and contribut to the construct of nuclear weapon develop base in northwest china howev as the split between the two parti and the two countri deepen the govern of the soviet union not onli ceas to provid teach model and graphic data for the atom bomb but also unilater void the agreement in august 1960 the soviet union withdrew all 233 expert assist china s develop of the nuclear industri and carri awai import graph and data the suppli of equip and materi stop shortli thereaft the unilater action by the soviet union to tear up the agreement caus sever difficulti and great loss in china s nuclear industri and nuclear weapon develop at thi kei moment the parti central committe decid to develop the atom bomb with china s own resourc thi import polici stimul the patriot fervor and nation pride of the develop personnel thei were determin to develop the atom bomb with their own intellig and skill thei were determin to break the hegemoni nuclear monopoli and bring glori to china and it peopl 1 tackl kei problem in atom bomb develop at the end of the 1950s china s nuclear base in the northwest were still under construct and not readi to begin r d work the second ministri of machin build decid to begin the research and design of the atom bomb in the nuclear weapon institut establish in beij in juli 1958 effort were put in three area the first area wa

commerc set up special second level wholesal station in lanzhou gansu these step stimul the confid and courag of the worker stabil the rank and ensur the normal progress of the project at the end of 1962 the explos pour plant and two small test site were complet and the base began to look like a develop base howev the deton test site and main build like the assembl plant were yet to be built in the meantim larg scale deton test and atom bomb assembl had to be move from beij to the base these project requir anoth 100 000 squar meter of capit construct the complex and qualiti requir of the construct togeth with the short frost free period on the qinghai plateau and under strength work forc made the base construct exceedingli difficult in earli decemb 1962 the central special committe review and approv the 2 year plan for atom bomb develop propos by the second ministri of machin build the committe also investig the construct progress of the northwest nuclear weapon base and decid to take some action to speed up the pace of construct on 7 decemb deputi director zheng hantao 6774 3352 3447 of the central special committe offic met with 13 depart includ the ministri of construct transport water conserv and electr power telecommun and the armi corp of engin railwai and commun it wa decid that a 15 000 man construct team with 500 piec of construct equip and 300 motor vehicl should be sent to the construct site for a crash build effort under the joint command head by li jue the major construct task werecomplet in april 1964 which made the breakthrough in atom bomb technolog possibl with the complet of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base the develop of the atom bomb wa gradual shift from beij to the northwest prior to 1969 the ninth bureau of the second ministri of machin build the beij nuclear weapon institut and the northwest nuclear weapon develop base were three name of the same institut the research design and product of nuclear weapon were done by the same organ in 1969 the new base wa complet and wa given the job of nuclear weapon research and design it wa call the nuclear weapon design institut the northwest nuclear weapon develop base wa then respons onli for the product of nuclear weapon the research design and product of the nuclear weapon have sinc been separ 3 product of enrich uranium and develop of nuclear compon a product of enrich uranium china s first atom bomb wa load with enrich uranium the time product of accept uranium wa therefor kei to the success develop of the atom bomb plan of the lanzhou enrich uranium plant began in 1956 and construct began in 1958 under the organ of plant director wang jiefu 3769 0094 4395 and with help from the no 101 construct compani the second engin offic of the no 103 instal compani and the atom energi institut the princip civil engin wa basic complet in 1960 in 1961 the diffus unit were in place and fluorid howev product and stabl oper of the plant still requir uranium

and synchron devic test result show that the nuclear compon and control system could stand the transport environ and their structur were reliabl us a self develop subcrit devic lai zuwu 6351 4371 2976 successfulli perform a subcrit test on the nuclear devic hi test result show that all the step in the assembl procedur of the atom bomb had suffici subcrit safeti safeti would be ensur even under the least favor condit us crude test method song guangzhou 1345 0342 3166 and other led the worker through a seri of test and solv technic problem in the machin and assembl process machin qualiti of the part wa assur in juli and august technic staff and worker at the northwest nuclear weapon base complet the assembl of three accept nuclear devic thi wa accomplish with strong support from variou depart and the oper wa perform strictli accord to the procedur the work wa led by cai baozhen 5591 2128 4176 in mid and late august the devic were ship via special train to the nuclear test base in the northwest follow the instruct from zhou enlai the movementwa kept under strict secreci and secur befor the train start detail transport procedur were formul specif requir were set for the stop along the wai and for transfer team and secur procedur the train wa escort by arm polic and the rout wa guard by public secur polic at the border of two provinc the train wa escort across the border by the public secur chief of the two provinc and the secur duti wa transfer from on to the other all the steel hammer for rail inspect were replac with brass hammer to avoid spark all the coal us by the train wa sift to detect the presenc of explos high voltag power wa temporarili cut off in region where the train wa pass under tight secur and plan the nuclear devic were safe deliv to the intend station in xinjiang the devic were then transport by truck to the northwest nuclear test site enrich uranium compon were flown directli to the test site on 16 octob 1964 china s first atom bomb wa successfulli deton at the northwest nuclear test site after the explos the atom energi institut conduct radiat chemistri analysi and the nuclear weapon institut and the northwest nuclear technolog institut conduct optic and mechan measur to determin the power of the explos the power wa equival to 20 000 ton of tnt close to the theoret valu the test result show that the research design experiment fabric and test of china s first atom bomb had met the design requir and a solid foundat wa establish for the develop of nuclear weapon section 3 breakthrough in hydrogen bomb technolog as a nuclear weapon the hydrogen bomb make us of the enorm amount of energi releas at the instanc of the fusion reaction thermonuclear reaction of deuterium and tritium isotop of hydrogen the power of a hydrogen bomb is much greater than that of an atom bomb there is a qualit jump from the atom bomb to the hydrogen bomb all countri engag in nuclear weapon develop have strive to develop the hydrogen bomb as quickli as possibl after thei succeed in develop the atom bomb china also began it explor of the hydrogen bomb and obtain some result while it wa develop the atom bomb in februari 1965 the central special committe approv the report on the acceler develop of nuclear weapon submit by the second ministri of machin build and decid to conduct a nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb devic in 1968 thi goal stimul all the worker in nuclear scienc and technolog to reach a new high 1 explor the theori of h bomb design the success stori in china s develop of the atom bomb wa the attent to design research and the basic principl it wa also an import approach to the h bomb technolog breakthrough the second ministri and the nuclear weapon institut took some effect action in basic research a in decemb 1960 base on the plan made by liu jie qian sanqiong and organ by huang zuchia 7806 4371 3174 and yu min 0060 2404 of the atom energi institut and form the lepton nuclear theori group the group began to explor h bomb principl and the differ physic process and viabl structur in 4 year the group ha submit 69 research result report and gain in depth understand of mani basic phenomena in septemb 1963 some of the scientist of the nuclear weapon institut began the theoret explor of the h bomb by design an atom bomb that contain thermonuclear materi after the success of the first nuclear test the institut quickli shift most of the theoret research to h bomb research in order tostrengthen the theoret effort on the h bomb the second ministri of machin build decid to move huang zuqia yu min and anoth 29 peopl from the atom energi institut to the nuclear weapon institut in januari 1965 after these chang the theoret group becam a strong forc in h bomb research b formul design principl in februari 1965 under the supervis of zhu guangya and peng huanwu deng jiaxian and zhou guangzhao led the scientist in consolid the experi of the previou stage of research and formul a work plan to achiev the h bomb technolog breakthrough the second step wa to complet the theoret design of the thermonuclear warhead to meet requir in weight power and the deploy of nuclear weapon c prepar accur and complet nuclear data accur and complet nuclear data ar import to the design of nuclear devic scientist at the nuclear weapon institut discov mani inconsist in nuclear data in the literatur in februari 1965 he zehui of the atom energi institut led 30 research staff to conduct nuclear reaction cross section measur for thermonuclear materi thei us the research result obtain by ding dazhao and other and obtain reliabl experiment data after half a year of experiment research d conduct exploratori h bomb test to understand thermonuclear reaction and to obtain first hand inform as need in the h bomb design the central special committe approv the test of an enhanc atom bomb the design of the enhanc atom bomb wa base on the first experiment atom bomb but contain a certain amount of thermonuclear materi the structur wa modifi correspondingli theoret design proceed quickli and us onli about half a year sinc the new test us compon of the deton system that wa emploi in the two previou atom bomb test the fabric process also progress quickli from septemb 1965 to april 1966 deton subcrit and environment test were complet on 9 mai 1966 an atmospher test of the enhanc atom bomb wa successfulli conduct thi test provid real data for the theoret studi of the h bomb e break through the h bomb design after a year of investig scientist clearli recogn that in order to break through the h bomb design principl thei must pursu mani approach and understand the princip factor that affect the burn of the thermonuclear materi and the rule of energi releas from februari to juli 1965 the theoret depart of the nuclear weapon institut concentr on sever structur propos and conduct repeat calcul the result were not satisfactori face an impass scientist consolid experi and conduct variou special topic symposia and discuss so that everyon could think about the problem and come up with new concept new idea and new propos the main direct for pursu the h bomb theori wa determin thi wai in the summer of 1965 scientist at the nuclear weapon institut learn from foreign new media that franc plan to conduct a test of their first thermonuclear devic in 1968 to win on for china and the chines peopl thei propos to realiz china s first h bomb befor the french deputi director yu min of the theoret depart of the institut led staff member to the huadong comput institut in shanghai befor nation dai and spent all the holidai calcul model after analysi thei obtain import result in the burn rule of thermonuclear materi howev the model wa too heavi and the specif power and specif fusion were low and did not meet the criterion of 1 million ton of tnt for everi ton yu min summar the result and made a seri of report staff member calcul some more ideal model and discov the kei in sustain burn of thermonuclear materi thi import issu in the h bomb principl wa thu resolv 2 speed up the product of thermonuclear materi and the develop of thermonuclear compon anoth import step in the develop of the h bomb wa the product of thermonuclear materi and thermonuclear compon just as china wa about to instal it first lithium deuterid 6 product line the soviet union cut off aid to china the second ministri of machin build immedi transfer the scientist engag in light isotop separ in the atom energi institut to the baotou nuclear fuel element plant to solv technic problem with assist from the atom energi institut beij univers and qinghua univers plant personnel tackl 95 topic center on the product of thermonuclear materi and solv the problem of the exchang tower enrich process and the product rate of the chemic exchang system meanwhil the first ministri of machin build activ sought out product equip like the reagent pump of the shenyang water pump plant and electrolysi trough and satisfi the need of the lithium deuterid 6 product line instal the instal personnel activ develop instal tool modifi the instal method and complet the instal of the main unit in earli 1963 in spring 1963 the lithium deuterid 6 product line wa readi for a test run the intermedi test for heavi water the materi for produc deuterium had basic been accept but industri scale product of heavi water wa still not possibl the central special committe request the ministri of chemic industri to includ the project at an earlier date in juli the committe again studi the heavi water problem and decid that the ministri of chemic industri should give top prioriti to small shop for produc heavi water the ministri then organ dalian greas chemic plant and shanghai institut of chemic engin and acceler the process of produc heavi water by electrolyt exchang accept heavi water wa produc in decemb 1963 and in mai 1964 there wa therefor a technolog base for build a heavi water plant subsequ the jilin chemic industri compani quickli built a small heavi water product shop and produc the first batch of accept heavi water with strong support from the beij institut of chemic design the first ministri of machin build and other depart in thi period the test run of the lithium deuterid 6 product line succeed on the first try and produc it first batch of product the plant then acquir the abil to produc lithium chlorid and metal lithium and produc deuterium by electrolyt decompos heavi water on 11 septemb 1965 the plant synthes it first charg of lithium deuterid 6 the northwest nuclear weapon develop base wa respons for machin lithium deuterid 6 into thermonuclear materi compon for the h bomb accord to the design shape and size in earli 1965 song jiashu 1345 1367 2885 and other scientist began the r d of thermonuclear compon the first problem thei encount wa the machin of the thermonuclear materi thei took a three prongedapproach to break through the technolog after repeat test thei settl on a fabric method that could yield near theoret densiti blank with fewer defect at a lower pressur scientist and worker were veri consciou about safeti in their work thei properli handl the possibl ignit problem of the thermonuclear materi dure mechan process thei also test dozen of coat and final found on coat that help the short term storag problem of thermonuclear compon after almost a year of develop the first set of accept lithium deuterid 6 compon wa produc and the fuel problem for the enhanc atom bomb and h bomb test wa solv these result were veri crucial for the success develop of the h bomb 3 the first hydrogen bomb successfulli develop in decemb 1965 expert of the northwest nuclear weapon institut conduct a seri of studi these studi were chair by deputi director wu jilin 0702 7139 7207 and particip in by deputi minist leu xiyao 0149 6007 1031 and li jue of the second ministri of machin build and second bureau chief hu ruexia 5170 5387 3838 of the defens scienc commiss after these studi it wa determin that the theoret propos of trigger the h bomb with the atom bomb wa reason and feasibl accord to the basic principl base on thi analysi it wa possibl to have a smaller and lighter 1 megaton h bomb with a higher specif fusion at the end of 1967 or the first half of 1968 the emphasi for break through the h bomb technolog wa therefor place on the new propos howev the new propos wa onli a concept and it success wa not ensur on the other hand the origin plan h bomb although larger heavier and have a smaller specif fusion ratio wa more like to succe base on theoret consider for thi reason research and test of the origin design wa not abandon either with the two prong approach as the guid concept the second ministri of machin build formul the 1966 and 1967 plan for nuclear weapon develop the plan were approv by the central special committe after that the committe approv the specif step to implement the 2 year plan and the request by the relev depart to cooper the new arrang for break through the h bomb technolog develop quickli in the new plan the difficult task of trigger the thermonuclear devic with the atom bomb had to be overcom after hundr of deton simul experi and mani in depth academ discuss a clever method emploi by chen changyi and tao zucong 7118 4371 5115 solv thi technic problem and provid experiment data for the theoret design of the deton to design the bodi of the h bomb physicist and mechan research studi the physic pictur and mechan in the explos process of the thermonuclear devic investig the effect of the explos of the deton bomb on the main h bomb and master the layout of the compon and the relationship of energi releas the theoret design of the h bomb bodi wa thu formul howev by the time the theoret design plan for the entir experiment devic wa hand to the design and manufactur depart it wa alreadi mid octob 1966 the design and manufactur depart had veri littl time to complet the engin design and to fabric the devic furthermor the devic wa veri complex with mani odd shape compon which were hard to make to ensur qualiti and schedul theorist design and manufactur work togeth exchang idea discuss problem and move the design and manufactur prepar forward after the complet of the theoreticaldesign plan the design and manufactur move forward togeth to save time by decemb 1966 all the design and manufactur task had been complet howev when scientist inspect the h bomb experiment devic on 10 octob a major compon wa found to have qualiti problem when zhou enlai learn of thi he sent lie jie to fly in on a special plane on the next dai to inspect the problem on site inspect show a crack that wa visibl onli with a magnifi glass liu studi with the scientist and determin that the compon wa usabl and the crack would not affect the explos test thu the experiment devic wa ship to the northwest test site as schedul to ensur the success of the test theoret design and test personnel ad mani monitor for differ part of the thermonuclear devic eight addit near field physic measur were ad and each measur involv mani item under the guidanc of wang ganchang and deputi director hu renyu of the experiment depart test personnel carefulli formul measur procedur and repeatedli calibr and tune the detector transmiss system and record all measur prepar were readi on time on 28 decemb 1966 the design principl test pass with fly color the result show that china had master the kei technolog of h bomb develop howev the thermonuclear reaction of thi test wa incomplet becaus of the small quantiti of thermonuclear fuel us in the test and becaus of the field limit of the equival in order to understand the paramet of a fulli develop thermonuclear reaction and to further evalu the design principl and it futur prospect the second ministri obtain permiss from the central special committe to conduct a direct full equival air drop h bomb test prepar for thi test were to be complet by 20 june 1967 to thi end mao zedong sign a telegram author the nuclear weapon base to temporarili halt the big four activ of the great cultur revolut the decis by mao and by the central special committe

pilot in the great hall of the peopl on 30 mai section 4 test of missil with nuclear warhead to test a missil with a nuclear warhead the missil serv as the carrier and a nuclear warhead is deliv to a target locat to caus a nuclear explos on 27 octob 1966 china successfulli deliv an atom bomb with a medium to short rang missil and conduct a nuclear explos test it mark the possess of practic missil warhead weapon by china 1 a care decis on 5 decemb 1963 the central special committe made a decis that china s nuclear weapon develop should be base mainli on missil deliv warhead supplement by aircraft deliv warhead to link up the atom bomb technolog with the missil technolog technic discuss and coordin were held by scientist and engin from the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build and the fifth academi of the ministri of defens these activ were organ by the central special committe the defens industri offic and the defens scienc commiss r d effort were initi accord to technic topic sinc china had no experi in thi area it had to go through a learn process in evalu the perform of the missil s atom warhead initi the nuclear weapon institut believ that an atom bomb would be readi for instal on a medium to short rang missil after ground simul test for missil flight environ deton test full rang flight test of the deton control system and underground test of the perform of the nuclear warhead for thi reason the third nuclear test arrang by the defens scienc commiss wa an underground test the purpos wa to determin the power and perform paramet of the medium to short rang missil with an atom warhead in novemb 1965 the defens scienc commiss and the second ministri of machin build did some in depth analysi and decid that the underground test could not test whether the atom bomb would satisfi the actual flight condit in order to develop nuclear warhead that could surviv the flight test the underground test wa temporarili put on hold instead a cold test under flight condit would be conduct onc there wa strong confid a hot flight test would be made in term of actual need the hot flight test would be best conduct at full equival and full rang so as to test the combin of the atom bomb and missil technolog on 13 decemb the second ministri made such a suggest to the central special committe at the end of decemb zhou enlai chair the central special committe meet and carefulli studi the suggest zhou ask the defens scienc commiss to make up sever scenario and make some comparison for the committe to evalu in februari 1966 the defens scienc commiss invit leader from the second and seventh ministri of machin build the gener staff the equip plan depart the northwest gener missil test base and the nuclear test base to studi the test propos of the modifi medium to short rang surfac to surfac missil with nuclear warhead the meet decid that neither ground simul test nor underground explos test could truli simul the actual fight condit to test the combin of the missil and the atom bomb a cold flight test could not evalu the actual condit of the atom bomb dure flight a full rang full power hot test with a normal trajectori and a low altitud explos would not onli achiev the test goal but would also conform to actual war condit in term of reliabl and test safeti the modifi medium to short rang missil had it own self destruct devic if a malfunct occur dure the power part of the flight a signal could be sent from the ground to destroi the missil the nuclear warhead had a safeti switch and the switch would not open if the warhead fell off dure flight the bomb bodi would be destroi upon impact the ground but there would not be a nuclear fission reaction so the hot test wa feasibl from a safeti point of view it wa therefor decid that a cold test would be made as a practic run follow by a hot test in the meet specif studi were also made for the launch site the target zone the rang the explos altitud the test item and the divis of task on 26 februari the defens scienc commiss report the studi result to the central special committe on 11 march zhou enlai chair a central special committe meet and carefulli studi the defens scienc commiss report base on the technolog level at the time and the desir to quickli develop and test a missil warhead the central special committe agre to the test plan propos by the defens scienc commiss the committe ask the scienc commiss to organ the second and seventh ministri and conduct more preparatori test so that the test could be guarante absolut safe the commiss also set a date of the end of august for complet all preparatori test 2 care prepar in order to guarante the absolut safeti of the hot flight test of the nuclear warhead missil the defens scienc commiss the offic of defens industri and the second and seventh ministri of machin build made care prepar in march and june 1966 the defens scienc commiss twice review the technic plan launch plan measur plan and accid handl plan and set a progress schedul for field engin weather commun aviat and logist task meanwhil special topic studi and arrang were also made for the polit work of the test mission the offic of defens industri also call a number of meet of the second and seventh ministri to studi the develop and test of the missil and warhead problem that aros in the coordin were resolv in a time manner the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build conduct a seri of test for the nuclear devic and the deton control system it also revisit the reliabl of the deton system and the self

practic ensur the success of the first nuclear test and have been strictli adher to and improv upon in the follow test when high power nuclear explos test were conduct in the atmospher the nuclear test base sent personnel to nearbi settlement point to organ safeti protect and to conduct dosag measur sinc all the test were conduct with westerli wind near the earth surfac of the test site the live quarter and assembl area west of the test site and up wind region nearbi were basic not contamin investig were made to ascertain whether the radioact materi releas in the nuclear test had caus local environment contamin and whether thei pose a health hazard to local resid from 1982 to 1987 a 6 year studi wa made in residenti region near the test site and in control region these studi were made by 40 scientist from the follow unit the health and protect station of the xinjiang radiat medicin offic the hami region immunolog station the altai region immunolog station and the nuclear weapon institut the region of investig near the nuclear test site refer to the nearest villag from the lop nur test site in differ direct the nearest on wa 120 km and the farthest on wa 400 km the rest of them were about 200 km awai the control region were locat at about 700 to 1 000 km from the test site the environ of the investig region and the control region were basic the same except for the degre of contamin by the nuclear test after comprehens care and exhaust investig the follow conclus were reach the nuclear test did not caus notic local contamin of residenti area and the test had no detriment effect on the health of the resid the radioact level of foodstuff produc in the region near the test site wa within safe limit 2 safeti and protect downwind from test site while pai attent to safeti in the test site and the surround area china also paid great attent to the safeti area in the downwind direct outsid the test area in china s first nuclear test on a tower in octob 1964 the explos time wa chosen to be in the afternoon so that it would be deep into the night when the radioact cloud drift over settl area downwind from the test site thi wai direct contact with the radioact dust particl by personnel and anim could be avoid aerial sampl and surfac monitor of the radioact after the explos show that there wa slight radioact fallout in area under the radioact cloud but the valu wa still within the safeti threshold and no harm wa done to local resid even so zhou enlai wa still concern on 2 novemb 1964 after hear the report of the first nuclear test zhou order an escal of the monitor of radioact fallout outsid the test site he also point out that there should be more surfac sampl point for radioact fallout between 20 degre north latitud and 60 degre north latitud monitor station should be place at lhasa chengdu wuhan guangzhou and shanghai in the south urumqi yumen hami lanzhou baotou hohhot chengd jin zhangjiak baichengzi harbin manzhouli hailar and mishan in the north liaodong peninsula shandong peninsula and along the yalu river in the middl in the air sampl should be taken along three line in the east the southeast and northeast other sampl should be taken for fresh water sea water veget plant and fruit the defens scienc commiss thoroughli implement zhou s instruct to ascertain the direct of cloud movement develop trend and radioact dosag the defens scienc commiss detect sampl and measur the radioact cloud outsid the test zone with aircraft equip with self record micro roentgen meter and with radiat monitor weather balloon thi monitor wa done with the particip of the gener staff weather bureau the gener staff chemic troop the air forc and the atom energi institut in each of the nuclear test thei follow the forecast of radioact cloud movement and acquir sampl along three line in the east southeast and northeast sampl were taken at three altitud in the 23 atmospher nuclear test china conduct the air forc flew a total of 485 sorti us 283 aircraft of six differ model begin in 1967 weather station in region pass by the radioact cloud deploi radiat weather balloon accord to the direct and speed of the cloud to reduc the radioact fallout in region downwind from the test site the defens scienc commiss also agre to have the gener staff weather bureau enhanc the forecast of cloud movement and made precipit in region pass by the cloud on of the consider in decid a test date for exampl the larg atmospher nuclear explos that took place on 29 septemb 1969 wa origin schedul for 26 septemb howev in the morn of the 26th the weather chang forecast had the radioact cloud move along the border and into a neighbor countri as it move in the downwind direct at 6 am zhou enlai heard the report of leader of the defens scienc commiss and decid to conduct the test on a differ date in order to assur the safeti of resid in a neighbor countri the decis wa first report to mao zedong and hi approv wa obtain to assess the dust fallout situat in china after the nuclear test the ministri of health establish the industri hygien institut as a nation center and built 46 environment radiat monitor station around the countri in each nuclear test these station measur the amount of dust fallout radioact concentr in near surfac air radioact in rain water and water sourc the degre of contamin of veget and gamma rai dosag at the ground surfac to studi the long term effect of radioact contamin the ministri of health made two larg scale survei in 1975 and 1977 respect on the radiat exposur and health situat of resid in dunhuan and jiuquan the survei were conduct by the industri hygien institut of the ministri of health the industri hygien institut of gansu and chemic troop in the lanzhou militari region in june 1979 these unit made a comprehens analysi of the monitor data and resid health data collect in the variou nuclear test the conclus wa that radiat exposur of the resid wa minor it wa less than the natur radiat background of the region and also less than the limit set in the radiat protect regul in comparison studi there wa also no evid that the resid health had been affect by the dust fallout of the nuclear test china ha acquir a great amount of data on aerial radioact cloud and radioact dust fallout outsid the test zone in it mani atmospher nuclear test it ha learn the movement behavior of radioact cloud and the characterist of radioact fallout it ha also found empir calcul method for forecast the path and concentr of radioact cloud and the contamin of ground air and rain water by fallout these find were crucial for the protect of troop movement and resid safeti base on the measur data and analysi of radiat dosag in downwind area it wa conclud that china s nuclear test pose no danger to the popul of neighbor countri in the downwind direct becaus china paid so much attent to the health and safeti of the popul within and without china and work so hard on safeti and protect all it 23 nuclear test were conduct safe section 8 underground nuclear test in underground nuclear test the nuclear devic is buri at a certain depth underground and then deton gener there ar two type of underground test tunnel nuclear test and shaft nuclear test compar to atmospher nuclear test underground test requir a higher degre of technolog more construct work and a higher cost howev thei have certain uniqu advantag such test not onli contain the radioact product underground which is desir in term of environment protect and secreci but also facilit the collect of radioact product sampl in particular physic diagnost measur mai be carri out veri close to the nuclear devic result of underground test ar us for improv nuclear weapon design and for studi the linear destruct effect of radiat these data ar indispens in the theoret research and design of nuclear weapon the move from atmospher test to underground test wa necessit by the object need of nuclear weapon develop 1 tunnel test in a tunnel test a special design long tunnel is dug into a mountain the nuclear devic and variou probe ar instal in the tunnel after the tunnel is fill and seal in a special wai the nuclear devic is deton follow instruct from zhou enlai the second ministri of machin build and the defens scienc commiss made a preliminari investig of the underground nuclear test problem later the defens scienc commiss follow the decis of the central special committe and organ the nuclear test base to formul a plan for nuclear test in tunnel and in shaft to thi end zhang yunyu zhang zhishang and zhang ying did a care site select for underground nuclear test and propos that the site for the tunnel test be chosen at nanshan in the nuclear test base the propos wa approv by zhou enlai in earli 1965 an extens studi wa organ by the defens scienc commiss and the site of the nanshan underground test wa final the studi wa conduct by the defens engin design institut of the engin the geologi institut of the chines academi of scienc the ministri of petroleum and the ministri of geologi the studi investig the geologi the hydrogeolog the rock chemistri and the mechan properti of rock later the nuclear weapon institut conduct theoret calcul for the propag of shock wave in rock and for the self seal mechan of the tunnel simul test were perform for chemic explos and the theoret paramet were unifi and revis these activ were the technic prepar for the underground nuclear test china origin plan to conduct it first underground test us a tunnel in mai 1966 later the plan wa temporarili halt by the central special committe becaus china want to come up with a flight test warhead as soon as possibl and to concentr resourc on the technolog breakthrough of the hydrogen bomb after the first success air burst test of china s hydrogen bomb in 1967 the defens scienc commiss held detail discuss with expert includ wang ganchang and cheng kaijia in octob and novemb regard the object test item and engin requir for china s first underground test it wa decid that the princip object of china s first tunnel nuclear test wa to explor the characterist of china s underground nuclear test and to conduct near field physic measur of the nuclear bomb in order to provid data for improv nuclear bomb design in mai 1965 the construct and progress of the variou task were coordin at the nuclear test base after redefin the task the construct for the underground test continu in the spring of 1969 becaus of technic requir there were a number of modif the tunnel construct involv extens engin complex technolog limit work surfac and high risk in view of these characterist the nuclear test base organ an engin command a technic guidanc command and a tool and materi suppli command and establish a sound construct procedur worker were fearless and work around the clock in the hot and stuffi tunnel togeth thei improv the technolog and complet 54 experiment engin project in june accord to plan and meet qualiti standard test and scientif experiment were arrang by the nuclear weapon design academi and the nuclear weapon institut after 2 month thei complet the instal and test of 400 piec of equip in earli septemb to assur safeti the defens scienc commiss met at the test site in april 1969 and work on technic measur that would prevent mishap in the test such as blow the top jump the gun misfir and dud in the even of 10 august the central special committe heard the report of deputi command zhang ying of the nuclear test base regard the prepar of the test site zhou enlai stress that the test must be done safe so that accid such as blow the top and leak of radioact materi could be avoid the nuclear test base again calcul the resist and wave absorpt in the tunnel and analyz the variou extern environ factor and thei were sure that the prevent measur taken would prevent jump the gun on 15 septemb the nuclear devic wa place in the explos chamber and the tunnel wa subsequ seal at 0015 on 23 septemb china successfulli deton it first tunnel nuclear test the tunnel s self seal mechan work and there were no blow the top or jump the gun incid the yield of the nuclear explos wa basic in agreement with the design to understand the characterist of tunnel nuclear test and to verifi the agreement between the theoret design and the actual explos the tunnel and explos chamber were excav from 1970 to 1971 the height and the size of the chimnei caus by the explos were measur and the effect of the self seal and fill function were investig three core were drill to collect the radioact materi gener by the explos first hand data of these investig show that the self seal technolog and the specimen core technolog were success the theoret understand of the fluid mechan of an underground nuclear explos wa basic in agreement with realiti diagnost measur made near the nuclear bomb yield import data and point to new direct in the develop of near field physic measur through thi test understand of underground nuclear test wa valid and enhanc and major interfer problem were reveal in the near field physic measur becaus the test wa conduct in limeston it gener a great amount of carbon monoxid and carbon dioxid which were detriment to the safeti of radiat chemistri analysi it wa not desir to conduct underground nuclear test in limeston the nuclear test base therefor move the test site to the granit beishan north mountain underground test site to gain more experi in underground nuclear test to improv the weapon design and to test new nuclear principl five more test were conduct from 1975 to the end of 1988 at the nanshan and beishan test site in the second tunnel nuclear test on 27 decemb 1975 import data were obtain in the near field physic diagnost measur these data help solv the technic problem in tunnel self seal rapid sampl acquisit and electromagnet interfer in near field physic measur in the third tunnel nuclear test on 17 octob 1976 new advanc were made in rapid sampl acquisit and new understand were gain in nuclear explos in granit and anti interfer technolog in the fourth nuclear tunnel test on 4 mai 1983 rapid sampl core wa achiev for the first time abund high qualiti solid sampl of radioact materi for chemic analysi were obtain in the first drill meanwhil major advanc were made in near field physic measur technolog on 19 decemb 1984 the fifth nuclear tunnel test wa conduct the test wa made for a new principl in nuclear weapon and the experi wa a success china had made a major breakthrough in new nuclear weapon technolog 2 shaft nuclear test in a shaft test the nuclear devic and variou sensor ar lower to the bottom of a larg diamet well the well is then fill and the nuclear devic deton due to the depth limit of a tunnel test most mountain cannot satisfi the experiment requir thi is particularli true for high power explos in a shaft test there is usual no limit to explos power as long as the underground rock ar suitabl for test a shaft can be drill to the depth need for the particular explos power for thi reason the shaft test mode ha becom the princip method for underground nuclear test in april 1967 china chose the xing er region northwest of lop nur for the shaft test site after year of effort a complet experiment facil and live quarter were establish and variou equip develop the necessari condit for conduct the test were basic provid a shaft nuclear test requir a well with a larg diamet and a certain depth drill such a shaft requir a larg drill rig in octob 1966 the nuclear test base the nuclear weapon institut and engin depart survei coal mine oil field and machineri depart and submit a propos to the defens scienc commiss to develop a larg diamet hard rock drill machin on 9 mai the central special

first ministri of machin build other particip unit includ the nuclear test base the coal institut the lanzhou petrochem plant the luoyang institut of mine machineri the shanghai institut of coal mine machineri and the beij institut of mine in octob 1967 work began on design plan in 1971 the drill machin wa assembl at the lanzhou petrochem plant and move to the nuclear test base the develop of the larg drill machin wa the kei to shaft test of nuclear weapon in 1973 the drill began at the test base by april 1975 the first granit shaft 300 meter deep and 2 5 meter in diamet wa drill later sever other shaft were drill and drill techniqu gradual improv in april 1975 the nuclear test base submit the propos for the underground shaft nuclear test to the defens scienc commiss extens discuss and deliber were then made by the nuclear test base the nuclear weapon design institut and the engin design institut of the defens scienc commiss in march and april 1977 the defens scienc commiss review the gener plan for conduct the first underground shaft nuclear test and coordin the technic task of engin test and nuclear devic a 200 meter deep granit shaft wa chosen for the test the main goal of the test wa to learn the skill for shaft test and to gain experi in adopt engin techniqu test safeti and nuclear devic test techniqu to the underground shaft environ the engin design and the design of nonstandard equip were assum by the engin design institut of the defens scienc commiss the nuclear weapon institut wa respons for the design and develop of the enclosur for the nuclear devic and the seal of the explos chamber the construct of the shaft began in april 1977 sinc the flood rate of the shaft wa 9 3 ton per hour the seal of the nuclear devic and test safeti were jeopard to counter thi problem the flood wa reduc by seal and reinforc the shaft wall the daqe oil field on more than on occas sent peopl to the test site to advis the pump of water the technolog team of the test base seal the water by sprai grout and by grout inject after 15 month of tireless work the shaft construct wa complet the flood rate wa reduc to 2 5 ton per hour basic satisfi the test requir in juli 1978 hoist and instal began to be fail safe a test hoist wa done first after gain some experi in hoist the offici hoist wa done in late septemb when the offici hoist wa perform the nuclear devic wa place in a special seal contain measur probe and the seal nuclear devic were then place in a special seal explos chamber tube were us to connect the contain the probe and the cabl into an integr whole which wa slowli lower to the bottom of the shaft the hoist of the assembl wa tricki and it procedur need rigor control the instal personnel of the test base adher to a posit respons system and safe lower the devic to the bottom of the shaft the shaft tube back fill began on 2 octob back fill wa perform while the water wa be pump after 12 dai of hard work 1 400 cubic meter of space wa back fill and the qualiti wa complet in keep with requir the difficult task of construct and fill the shaft wa done by the 1st compani 6th battalion of the technolog team of the nuclear test base thi courag compani wa award the titl of new long march commando by the central committe of the chines communist youth leagu to ensur a safe and success test the work to elimin error and dud wa firmli grasp the nuclear
