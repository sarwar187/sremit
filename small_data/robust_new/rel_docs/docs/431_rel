mass layoff occur in the aerospac industri these ar the job of the futur if thei ar lost there will be a sever problem he sai in thi welt interview the public doe not yet realiz that both kei technolog and the mean for secur our veri exist ar at stake norbert lossau spoke to walter kroell lossau mass layoff ar occur in the german aerospac industri what do you see as the caus of thi trend kroell the aerospac industri is in fact in a veri critic situat in the aviat sector thi is a result of excess capac a ruthless price war is be wage contract ar be cancel and capac is thu not fulli taken up even in success firm such as the european airbu a second factor is the drastic cut in militari contract as a result of worldwid detent which from all other point of view can onli be welcom the critic situat in the space sector result larg from the fact that pursuant to esa european space agenc council of minist decis capac built up over a fairli long period must now be significantli cut back the develop program for the european herm space plane wa cancel in 1993 the free flier plan under the columbu program had been given up even befor that all we ar left with is the debat on the role of a dock on laboratori modul for an intern space station the financi polit and program framework lack stabil and continu lossau so first and foremost you identifi the instabl of polit condit as the root caus of the german space industri s weak kroell it is true that the polit situat is difficult prioriti have to be set in the ultim analysi howev the issu is what prioriti is to be assign to research and technolog in gener and to aerospac research and technolog in particular with a view to safeguard the german economi lossau how import is the aerospac industri to the german economi kroell if you look at the unit state japan or even south korea taiwan or indonesia you will see that these countri state program pronounc aerospac research and technolog to be kei technolog of the futur and draw the logic conclus nasa aviat research budget for instanc rose by 30 percent from 1992 to 1994 lossau why is space a futur technolog kroell becaus mani problem can onli be solv with help from the aerospac sector aerospac s contribut to solv traffic environ climat and energi problem will be indispens satellit ar need for weather forecast and intern crisi manag the develop of satellit commun will continu satellit base navig and mobil telephoni ar area whose signific is constantli increas lossau so ar we miss out on a major technolog while other countri ar invest in it kroell we ar inde run the risk of lose our abil to compet and collabor in these major field other european countri too itali and spain for instanc face particular financi problem that ar have repercuss on their space sector commit but gener speak space is regard as a particularli signific area of technolog in europ lossau why is it that aerospac enjoi particularli high statu in franc kroell germani current spend about 1 8 billion german mark dm a year on space wherea franc spend nearli dm3 2 billion it enjoi higher statu in franc becaus aviat and space ar wide recogn there as technolog of the futur moreov the french regard aviat and space as matter of nation ident an attitud complet alien to germani here the tendenc is rather to set thing in motion to reach a high standard mayb even a lead posit and then to keep cast doubt on them perhap thi is a featur of the german mental lossau ar we more hostil to technolog than the french kroell no i believ that the valu that german public opinion set on aerospac is at the crux of the matter the gener public doe not yet realiz that both kei technolog and the mean for secur our veri exist ar at stake if we want to withstand intern competit in the aerospac sector we need continu persist and stabl long term framework condit financi condit includ rather more modest figur if necessari provid thei remain stabl in the longer term lossau is germani lose job with futur prospect while other countri such as franc ar set long term safeguard on them kroell job in the aerospac sector ar job with a high technolog orient and prospect for the futur if we cut them back while other countri primarili the unit state and countri in southeast asia ar creat them we shall face seriou problem in the futur gener speak i believ it can be said that we shall onli render the crisi more acut in the futur if we cut back on research and technolog post in the present situat know how for american and russian lossau the reaction to everi fund cut ha alwai been in that case we shall onli do so much even that is still good research have the space sector s prestig and effect suffer from thi attitud too kroell it undoubtedli detract from the space sector s imag both the man in the street and the technic expert look for tangibl result thei rightli expect that onc thing have been initi in a climat of consensu thei should be brought to a proper and speedi conclus constantli adjust or revis plan give a bad impress of cours the space commun can onli spend the monei that it actual receiv if monei that is promis for develop herm for instanc is subsequ not forthcom the blame should not be laid at the door of the space sector lossau ar there area of aerospac in which germani enjoi a technolog lead kroell ye sever the dlr and it german partner ar the undisput world leader in space robot we have receiv interest offer for the us of our know how in futur american and russian project the dlr is also a leader and an internation sought after partner in teleoper and telemanipul anoth of our strong point li in sensor camera and radar scanner develop a concret exampl be the mar camera to be us on a russian mission to mar the american too acknowledg the lead that thi technolog ha gain lossau you mention robot ar we actual so far ahead of the american in thi field that thei would have prefer to prevent the german rotex robot from fly the d2 mission by set particularli high requir for it in term of spaceworthi kroell rotex ha not onli caus a sensat but ha given rise to some concern in both the unit state and japan there is no question about it the american themselv admit to concern that germani manifestli ha it nose out in front in thi import field of technolog the us of autom and robot in space lossau henc the attempt to prevent space trial with the german robot kroell i can confirm that the american set extrem high spaceworthi requir for rotex and that it wa difficult to demonstr that it met them but we succeed i cannot sai that the american set greater hurdl on purpos lossau when the german d2 astronaut visit houston i had the feel that thei were mere regard as the american junior partner kroell the american and russian ar undoubtedli the lead space nation nasa ha an incompar greater wealth of experi than we do inde it spend on quit a differ scale to thi extent i find it understand that the dlr wa regard as a junior partner on the shuttl flight but the lesser partner s achiev have earn the american high regard not onli for our astronaut compet and profession but for the dlr space center s oper handl in oberpfaffenhofen howev it would not be realist for us to claim to be a partner of equal weight and equal import to the american and russian especi as far as man mission ar concern new task wait for arian 5 lossau in 1993 the european and consequ the german as well were taken by surpris by an agreement between the american and russian to oper a space station togeth wherea there had been plan for year previous for a joint space station with the european how do you see thi turn of event kroell it would undoubtedli have been desir and proper to give the european earlier notic of these discuss but on never know when agreement of thi type mai come about dure discuss at top polit level in the midst of mani other perhap weightier topic at the moment it inde look as though we shall arriv at a joint european american and russian project thi joint space effort can onli be welcom and inde it is what germani ha alwai been call for so although the approach itself mai leav someth to be desir everyth point to europ and germani have a share in the space station lossau esa latest plan envisag a man space capsul to be launch into space with an arian rocket is thi the first step toward independ from the american kroell i believ europ must make a major point of incorpor the arian rocket into the overal concept of a space station of the type we have mention and us it as a transport vehicl howev if we want to do thi we must consid whether the transfer vehicl should be man or unman i think it would therefor be us at thi point to carri out studi to examin whether and with what modif arian 5 can be us to serv the space station the man capsul is on of the option that we can studi in term of ani advantag that it might offer it technic feasibl and it financ lossau when is the earliest we can expect a decis kroell not befor the end of 1995 lossau how much less than herm will it cost to develop thi capsul kroell that i do not know thi is on of the aspect that the plan studi set out to clarifi what should a capsul of thi type look like in detail what would it cost how doe it fit into the intern scenario these ar question that requir intens studi in ani case the capsul would have to cost substanti less than herm otherwis it would not be a realist altern lossau the politician ar the on who set your financ framework kroell correct as i have said the import thing is medium term stabil even if the financ framework turn out to be more modest than origin anticip then we shall have to see which prioriti can be met within that framework on thing is clear with significantli less monei we cannot achiev the initi target otherwis it would mean that the target had not been defin in seriou term data from space slumber in archiv lossau back to arian whose imag emerg from the spectacular fals start somewhat batter how serious do you take the danger of it success be complet undermin by cheaper competit from russia china or japan kroell the risk is real especi in the absenc of fair intern competit condit if there were a real open market with all the competitor enjoi equal opportun without polit price i should not be worri about arian lossau but rocket just like cd player can be produc more cheapli in countri with low wage level kroell there is no mass product for low wage countri to date in the aerospac industri russia is a low wage countri but just look at the host of peopl who i grant you work for low individu wage but taken togeth make for high overal cost cd player ar a differ matter the intern market and competit ar open there is no open market in rocket technolog nor do i see how on could come into be in the near futur if the russian or chines sai whatev the western price is we shall deliv rocket 20 or 30 percent more cheapli the price is not the result of low payrol cost but of polit calcul lossau but the unit state ha alreadi purchas some cheap flight from the russian and even from the chines kroell not onli the unit state if thing ar allow to continu much further in thi direct with transport capac be purchas wherev it is cheapest just think of the russian massiv excess capac arian will find it difficult to compet lossau can thi issu onli be settl at the polit level kroell ye framework agreement on the subject and quota arrang ar be negoti lossau apart from rotex can you give other exampl to illustr the signific of the man d2 mission kroell anoth outstand exampl is the dlr design mom camera dure the mission over 7 million squar kilomet of the earth were photograph in except qualiti most of the materi and life scienc experi perform dure the mission ar still be evalu but a number of excel result ar emerg here too lossau what will the mom photograph be us for kroell thei ar stereoscop imag with high resolut to just a few meter first and foremost these imag ar immens us for cartographi especi for part of the world that ar not readili access or ar complet inaccess thei also show veget cover veri clearli distinguish between bush grassland and cereal farm area and thei identifi the water collect area in karstic region thei ar also us when undertak three dimension terrain reconstruct lossau a practic unmeasur amount of data ha been beam to earth by satellit or brought back by man space mission the vast bulk of thi data is slumber unus on magnet tape doe thi not rather shake the credibl of claim that there is a constant need to collect more data kroell the problem and the challeng here is to broaden the base us the wealth of inform from space the fact that thi data ha not yet been us to the desir extent by no mean render it worthless it rather call for greater effort to organ us of the data more effect lossau is the fact that most of thi data is ly unus in the archiv attribut to lack of monei or lack of interest on the part of research kroell there ar potenti user who do not have the monei and there ar other who have not yet realiz that there is massiv potenti to be tap here what we need to do is activ and organ the user commun the dlr receiv the data collect by all the main and in the futur eastern civil satellit and can process it accord to user requir the problem is the end us of thi data monei is need to solv thi problem it would be danger to break the thread lossau in germani we do not hear much about the us of satellit for verif purpos is there not major work to be done in thi field in the futur kroell undoubtedli our defens ministri ha not yet gone in for space activ but i am convinc that the potenti for peacekeep and crisi manag from space will acquir increas import and that we too cannot afford to deni ourselv access to thi potenti in a context of intern cooper lossau in futur there will be less monei avail for man space mission do you mere put thi down to straighten financ or ha the need for research capac in space declin as well kroell straighten financ primarili and also a reset of prioriti within thi financi framework there will be no nation man space project in the forese futur and thi is fulli in line with the desir for internation we must therefor adjust our capabl in thi area accordingli i believ it is a good thing to set space prioriti in the environ and earth observ sphere and in particular technolog such as robot and telecommun regardless of budget size howev i would also regard complet discontinu work on man space flight as fatal

scienc and technolog have been respons for social and econom progress and for advanc in the standard of live for mankind howev while we have been enjoi thi progress these advanc have impos burden on the earth particularli in the degrad of the environ and in the deplet of energi and resourc two decad ago the club of rome propos in the limit to growth that there should be an overal zero growth to avoid the mankind s crisi anticip in the middl of the 21st centuri and to prevent continu environment degrad of the earth due to industri activ although it predict about the earth mai be valid we have been enjoi an affluent life we have thu come to realiz given the aspir of peopl toward a more affluent life and the orient of develop nation toward modern that zero econom growth is not practic at the present the world popul stand at about 5 5 billion accord to the unit nation white paper thi popul will exce 10 billion by the year 2050 and will continu even further should human activ continu to expand accompani such popul increas and econom growth the support system provid by the earth such an suppli of food resourc and restor of natur mai be destroi it is thu import to control the increas of popul to reduc consumpt and to recycl resourc howev i think that we ar approach to the point where we cannot overcom the foreseen crisi by such passiv measur alon sinc the earth is finit we must look beyond the earth to the infin of space the new frontier with everi effect mean for develop space in order to overcom such obstacl and problem and achiev a sustain develop for mankind in the past columbu in hi endeavor to locat the golden countri japan discov a new contin by coincid five hundr year later we with a firm percept of expand a frontier for human activ ar at the dawn of the second ag of the great voyag the immin challeng of the present space develop in the mission to planet earth which is also the major topic of intern space year isi 1992 i think that in the 21st centuri we will enter the era of mission from planet earth when we ar go to expand our live sphere beyond the confin of the earth and to pursu new discoveri it is inevit and natur for space to becom our theater ever sinc the launch of sputnik space develop worldwid ha undergon major advanc varieti of satellit us for commun broadcast and earth observ man on the moon planet explor man space activ with those tremend advanc dream of mankind have been realiz on after anoth base on our accomplish in space hitherto the concept to expand the human frontier into space might never be castl in the air in order to explor a new frontier in space for mankind the global scale cooper is essenti under reconcili between east and west we will need to organ a new comprehens mechan in the 21st centuri in order to achiev our common target of mankind we will also need to establish a more harmoni system of rule and law what is most essenti howev is to achiev the understand of peopl to rais nation will and to establish an intern consensu therefor it is to sai that the kei is the resolut of mankind to what extent he is will to make the crucial effort hereaft i will focu on what ar technic challeng and to what extent thei ar feasibl in order to expand the new frontier for human activ i will not touch upon the topic of a new comprehens mechan or idea for a system of rule and law speak about the futur space activ in the 21st centuri the content and substanc differ depend on the time horizon i will defin the year 2030 when the current space activ will be termin as the time horizon that i am speak about man in near space if we expect the frontier of human activ in the middl of the 21st centuri the theater will be limit at most to our solar system furthermor i don t think that mercuri or venu will becom the frontier for mankind by the middl of the 21st centuri becaus their temperatur exce 400 c it would also be imposs to includ the planet beyond jupit in thi frontier becaus it take more than a thousand dai to reach from the earth meanwhil mar is somewhat under the similar environ to that of the earth a graviti of 0 38g surfac temperatur from 140 c to 20 c a thin layer of atmospher and it onli take about 240 dai to reach therefor mar can be consid as on frontier for mankind in the middl of the 21st centuri in the middl of the 21st centuri it is conceiv that the artifici celesti bodi near the earth space station spaceport the moon and mar would be the frontier the area in which mankind would be conduct their activ i will call the frontier encompass these bodi near space technolog challeng and respons what technolog challeng must be met for mankind to advanc into near space what respons ar need to overcom such technolog challeng 1 environ for life in space in near space the graviti radiat and thermal environ ar remark differ from those on the earth men have stai in space aboard mir station for up to on year we have learn that man can return to daili life with rehabilit after stai in space for sever dai howev such experi doe not enabl us to fulli understand the impact that long stai in space will have upon the human bodi we must hereaft demonstr how long mankind can stai in space assess long term physic respons to low micro graviti establish the method to maintain health in space the method mai includ provid artifici graviti physic train and rehabilit after return to the earth if these challeng could be resolv through variou experi and test on space station human can stai about on year under micrograv on an artifici celesti bodi and sever year under low graviti on the moon 0 17g and mar 0 38g theoret it s possibl to make 1g graviti by rotat an artifici celesti bodi howev thi is econom infeas becaus it structur and weight becom too enorm as for the radiat environ man can protect himself by the suffici heavi block insul of water metal or other materi thu the challeng is to develop method of block radiat at minimum cost the thermal environ on an artifici celesti bodi can be easili control by the current technolog which ha been appli to most artifici satellit control would also be feasibl if residenti area were construct underground on the moon and mar 2 oxygen water and food oxygen water and food ar indispens commod for man s surviv there ar two wai to provid these in near space transport from the ground or produc them in space it is simpl to transport them from the earth howev transport cost becom too much to support mani peopl live in space for long period it will be imper to obtain materi as much as possibl in near space and to recycl what is us oxygen can be reproduc from exhal carbon dioxid co sup 2 on an artifici celesti bodi oxygen could be obtain through the two process hydrogen reduct of co sup 2 to h sub 2 0 and then electrolysi of h sup 2 0 thi technolog of oxygen plant ha alreadi been establish on the ground the futur challeng ar to improv effici through improv catalyst to reduc size and to develop easili maintain system in addit oxygen could be produc from the oxid metal which constitut 42 of the soil of the surfac on the moon and by us carbon dioxid co sup 2 which constitut 95 of the atmospher on mar research and develop of produc oxygen with similar compound on the ground ha been initi thi technolog will almost certainli be of practic us in the middl of the 21st centuri water can be reproduc by recycl wast hygien water and urin the technolog to recycl water by mean of film filter and distil ha been under develop for space station freedom an advanc system could be util by the middl 21st centuri water can also be produc from lunar soil and from the atmospher or permafrost of mar the product technolog could be of practic us for suppli water in the middl of the 21st centuri food is basic suppli by a comprehens organ recycl system which produc and decompos organ matter a part of thi recycl system with plant onli ha alreadi been verifi on the ground the challeng is to improv thi system for us in space advanc comprehens organ recycl system includ anim ar exceedingli difficult to control so thi system will not be realiz by the middl of the 21st centuri thu astronaut could not enjoi beef but might eat veget and artifici meat produc in near space 3 transport for the transport to the moon or mar two phase method will be probabl emploi rather than the direct transport method like apollo program in thi two phase method two differ type of space vehicl will be develop and us on from ground to the spaceport in low earth orbit and from spaceport to the moon or mar the advantag of thi method is that varieti of space transport system can be flexibl assembl at the spaceport and thu it is not necessari to develop and launch a huge space transport system from the earth to low earth orbit the exist largest launch vehicl ha payload capabl of 100 ton into low earth orbit develop of larger scale launch vehicl for the first phase whose payload capabl is 200 to 300 ton mai be consid econom in the long run becaus we can reduc the amount of launch for the second phase of the transport from earth orbit to the moon mar mission orient system will be assembl at the spaceport if the exist chemic propuls is to be us the propel in particular oxygen will occupi most of the mass the net mass transport will amount to onli on sixth of the total mass for the moon and onli on tenth for mar it will therefor becom necessari to produc propel from resourc on the moon and mar higher perform system such as nuclear power must also be sought the technolog challeng for the futur transport system ar summar in four thrust develop a larg econom rocket with 200 to 300 ton capabl to low earth orbit establish the technolog to assembl larg structur in earth orbit produc propel on the moon and mar pursu nuclear propel system with safeti consider by the middl of the 21st centuri i suppos most of these task will have been definit achiev robot when man advanc into near space robot will plai import role sinc robot do not requir the same safeti and life support system as much as man and thei ar econom advantag it is inde natur to us robot as much as possibl therefor the extent of activ a man can do will depend upon how robot can be develop and us for human activ robot will probabl have made remark progress by the middl of the 21st centuri robot will be abl to receiv verbal command in the languag we us in daili life on receiv such command robot will be abl to think of the procedur to choos the tool and to implement the task when a man on the earth order a robot on mar the modul ha someth wrong pleas repair it the robot will do it the challeng in robot is to develop advanc element and compon electron precis machineri inform process control system and commun system natur languag comprehens imag recognit understand of the surround environ select of the solut and oper plan will also be the challeng for robot these element and kei technolog for robot ar now tremend progress and will be like to make the greatest progress in the 21st centuri after realiz of these technic challeng hitherto mention mankind will be abl to stai for limit period in near space by the middl of the 21st centuri regard man s perman stai in near space we need further effort to studi the long term effect of graviti and radiat on the human bodi befor we can determin whether mankind will be abl to live in near space perman therefor i see that the perman stai in near space will still be the big challeng for mankind even in the middl of the 21st centuri space activ in the 21st centuri base on the preciou observ i would like to show you my concept for space activ around the middl of the 21st centuri 1 on artifici celesti bodi artifici celesti bodi such as a spaceport a space factori solar power satellit space experi observ laboratori will be orbit around the earth for regular mainten of these bodi servic robot will be oper around them a spaceport will be a transfer station for the moon and mar propel suppli and food will be brought to the spaceport from earth to the moon there thei will be load on a vehicl to be transport to the moon to mar or to other artifici celesti bodi the spacecraft is to dock at the spaceport and will be maintain and check there in the space factori materi and pharmaceut with the highest util valu will have to be produc base upon select of variou micrograv experi these factori will have to be maintain by as few peopl as possibl and so will be highli autom energi requir for manufactur and live is to be transmit either by microwav from the solar power satellit or from the solar power plant construct at each space factori sever experi will be conduct in the space laboratori to investig the long term effect of low graviti upon anim and plant short term live in near space will becom easier and eventu tourist will visit for space sight see 2 on the moon on the moon there will be habit area lunarport mine site factori experi laboratori and observatori the lunarport in addit to launch and land facil of vehicl will have a mass driver us a catapult for cargo transport after the initi phase of resourc explor industri mine of resourc will have start by thi time a few peopl will be regularli station at each mine site if nuclear fusion power plant is oper on the earth then mine of helium 3 on the lunar surfac is probabl on a larg scale some lunar factori which will be instal after the verif of the pilot plant stage will be oper a limit number of worker and a lot of robot will be work there product made on the moon will includ oxygen and water structur materi such as brick glass cement steel aluminum and other metal comprehens organ recycl system plant will produc bread veget and artifici meat it mai be possibl by thi time to rais chicken and fish there is no atmospher on the moon to caus flicker which degrad observ from the earth the moon is thu veri suitabl for instal of optic and electr observatori station tourist from the earth mai eventu have vacat on the moon 3 on mar an outpost base will be establish on mar in the middl of the 21st centuri as it take 240 dai to reach mar and the flight opportun is onc everi two year the whole itinerari of on person would take 3 to 5 year therefor the personnel at thi outpost must includ doctor civil engin architect expert on the heat environment control and the life support system and so forth over ten peopl compris variou expert and specialist as well as appropri facil will be requir to support the outpost on mar at the outpost on mar the first stage of the research will be complet and pilot plant will be oper to conduct resourc explor experiment grow veget and breed anim and produc oxygen and water it is wide recogn that mar mai have been inhabit by live creatur by studi the caus of their extinct from mar we mai get import inform about global environment chang the research in thi area will advanc on mar conclus the primari goal of the space activ in the 21st centuri might be the mission from planet earth the concept i present to you is not onli my perspect of the futur but also reflect on my aspir and will as the head of a space agenc i should drive forward to realiz the concept just mention to expand new frontier into space as i mention earlier the space develop of the 21st centuri is go to be grand project which far exce the scale of current space activ it cannot be done sole by on countri but rather should be collabor by joint effort of mani countri space develop in the 21st centuri is not for the nation interest of on countri alon it is an undertak for all mankind and trasncend nation border i hope that thi asia pacif isi confer in commemor of the intern space year will give us the momentum to further strengthen cooper among countri worldwid i wish we would go side by side and jointli challeng toward the futur of expand a frontier for human activ in space

chaser spacecraft rendezv with and link up with that target spacecraft the process in which the chaser approach the target is call the rendezv and the process of link up is call dock rvd technolog also includ a seri of process in which after separ from the target the chaser either leav the target and return to earth or to a fix orbit posit or is jettison that is allow to enter the earth s atmospher and burn up henc rvd technolog could be call a type of complex technolog or system technolog that span a wide rang of activ 2 trend in rendezv dock technolog there ar onli two countri in the

the sfu will be equip with a navig guidanc and control system that can control the spacecraft for up to 44 hour and will be us to take it from an oper orbit to the space shuttl recoveri point under it

uniqu method of preserv the submarin komsomolet which sank 7 april 1989 in the norwegian sea approxim 180 mile southeast of bear island studi have been go on for sever year expedit have been organ and hundr of option have been examin as a result on option ha been select the best on it involv the construct of a sort of sarcophagu the committe for carri out special purpos underwat oper ha been task with coordin the project it chairman tengiz borisov familiar the editori offic with thi unusu project the nuclear submarin komsomolet ha now been ly on the bottom of the norwegian sea for almost five year todai we can sai that it wa the pride of the former soviet union s arm forc it wa the onli submarin of it kind in the world the most up to date and most deep water the komsomolet could dive to 1 000 meter wherea an ordinari submarin could onli go as far as 400 to 600 meter the vessel had a multipurpos design to us the languag of militari pilot it could be deploi as a fighter and a ground attack aircraft the komsomolet wa to have destroi missil arm submarin and carrier strike group compos of aircraft carrier and escort ship and it could also direct long rang fire against onshor target thi supersubmarin cost our state over 1 billion rubl at old price in present dai price thi is approxim 1 trillion howev the komsomolet wa in fact unabl to serv the motherland dure a routin patrol it caught fire and sank a total of 20 convent torpedo and two fit with nuclear warhead went down with it the latter gave caus for concern becaus there wa a danger thei would contamin the environ with radioact substanc the veri first expedit to the accid site confirm the specialist fear the radiat situat in the vicin wa not good a second set of studi back up the previou find with new inform in the final analysi the situat at the site of the komsomol wreck wa such that all permiss norm had been exceed mani time over thi provok a neg reaction from a number of countri the decis wa then made to rais the komsomol a number of countri offer to help in formul a plan to rais the submarin from the bottom of the norwegian sea thei includ state such as the unit state franc itali and sweden dozen of propos were also put forward by our own scientist and design the special commiss receiv plenti of interest and promis option for exampl some specialist suggest us cryogen technolog that is to sai thei plan to freez the submarin and lift it in the form of a block of ic other insist on dismemb the komsomolet with a view to coax each part out of the wateri depth separ still other sought a wai out of the problem by us an enorm overhead crane there were also to put it mildli on or two quit unrealist plan thu some peopl tri to demonstr that the vessel could be pump full of a special foam materi which would turn into foam rubber and ensur the buoyanc of the submarin which would then float to the surfac of it own accord anoth veri simpl method would be to latch onto the komsomolet with a kind of lasso and tow it toward the shore meanwhil the former ussr parti leadership issu a decre task the appropri organ and depart with carri out the work necessari to rais the sunken submarin the aim wa to establish the real reason for the wreck of the komsomolet and to remov the torpedo with nuclear charg but there wa a hitch becaus the state lack the fund to carri out an oper of thi sort at the time about 300 million were need howev expedit to the bottom of the norwegian sea show that it ha also becom imposs to rais the submarin from the technic point of view thi is why us the man deep sea submers mir 1 and mir 2 it ha prove possibl to descend to the site of the sunken submarin here at a depth of 1 700 meter it is pitch black the searchlight shine out of the porthol pick out a wall of snow it seem as if a blizzard wa rage at the bottom of the norwegian sea appar there is a larg accumul of plankton in precis thi area it hamper attempt to follow the plan rout the submers encount a number of small and medium size fish along the wai the specialist were abl to determin the exact posit of the submarin it is ly atop a 40 meter thick silt inclin further on there is a precipic and an increas in depth the komsomolet is ly level on an even keel the submarin s posit encourag the specialist to think that thei could execut their plan to rais the vessel after a thorough examin of the submarin it becam appar that the inner hull wa badli damag it ha practic been blown in two in the vicin of the forward compart even though the fire occur in the stern a studi of video materi and a comparison of inform obtain dure the expedit show that a power explos had occur on the vessel thi could have happen dure the depressur and flood of the submarin or at the moment when it hit the bottom thi explos damag the submarin for the first time our specialist were abl to go insid the komsomolet us remot control robot a terribl pictur unfold befor the investig smash floor deck and all sort of structur had form massiv obstruct the submarin s system instrument and equip had been transform into scrap metal thei were unabl to find the bodi of ani sailor robot the size of larg vacuum cleaner enter the komsomolet through gap in the hull and two open porthol thei reach the torpedo apparatu thei not onli examin the forward cover assembl enclos the warhead but also the tail section of the torpedo the conclus drawn by the specialist were veri sorri inde the beryllium screen the neutron deflector which ar a design featur of the warhead and which prevent the plutonium from spread were heavili corrod and partial destroi in the scientist opinion these screen will onli last until the end of thi year or the middl of 1995 thei will no longer be in ani state to hold back the radioact materi insid as a result a total of 400 curi an extrem danger dose will leak into the environ for the purpos of comparison a total of 0 38 curi wa discharg into the water in the far east thi led to an intern outcri here howev we ar talk about a discharg 1 200 time more potent basic with everi dai that pass the nuclear warhead aboard the sunken submarin ar be destroi as a result of electrochem corros on a larg scale while the komsomolet wa ablaz on the surfac militari pilot photograph it from the air these photograph show that the water around the submarin wa liter boil these high temperatur caus the submarin s special coat to peel off and ow to the differ in temperatur between the insid and outsid of the submarin the vessel basic explod natur it is quit imposs to disturb or manipul a heavi cumbersom object weigh almost 10 000 tonn and measur 117 meter in length with a diamet of approxim 10 meter in such a condit otherwis the hull would split in two and the protect structur of the torpedo apparatu would fall apart it is imposs to guess in advanc what the consequ of such an environment disast might be thi is why specialist have start to look for a wai of neutral the komsomolet that avoid have to bring it to the surfac of all the suggest thei have receiv the specialist from arzama 16 the rubin central design bureau and the committe for carri out special purpos underwat oper under the russian feder govern have pick the safest construct a kind of sarcophagu in the submarin s nose section work on thi project ha been complet it ha been coordin with a dozen ministri and depart and hand over to the state environment expert committe the initi plan wa to construct an extern sarcophagu in other word the intent is to cover the submarin s nose cone with concret at a depth of 1 700 meter but calcul have shown that on soft ground with a densiti of just 1 8 the komsomolet could break up it wa then decid to construct an intern sarcophagu but in thi case it wa assum that special substanc would be us sorbent capabl of absorb ani plutonium that escap eight such sealant were approv in a test dure the latest expedit thei perform well but specialist have chosen the veri best at the moment thei ar run them through yet more test thi summer a new expedit will set off for the sunken komsomolet some 100 kg of sorbent will be pump into the interior mezhbortnoy prostranstvo after thi all the hatch and cabin will be seal constant environment monitor will be organ in the area the oper to construct the sarcophagu at the site of the accid and the

have drop due to the strong yen from gain market share in japan the report argu that becaus of such barrier the commonli understood logic that yen appreci will lead to increas import which in turn

the ceo valu as the basi for select equip equip manufactur have respond to the strong demand for cost reduct from lsi manufactur by us the ceo index to quantifi their equip divid the cost by throughput and avail thi trend wa visibl at semicon japan figur 3 through 6 the us of the ceo index aim at the american lsi manufactur market which is move toward ceo as a basi for select equip for purchas at the same time thi also should set up a common ground for competit in japan where evalu standard have been less rigor in fact it ha even been said that intel ha not made purchas becaus the ceo valu wa not provid the equip with higher product to be introduc start at the end of 1993 and into 1994 fall mainli into two type the first type is equip to improv product by a factor from 1 3 to 2 for 16m which will receiv real fund in 1994 in other word the ceo valu will decreas 25 to 50 percent compar to earlier equip the second type is experiment equip preced the complet of 64m product equip here the product will increas by a factor from 1 5 to 2 mean that the ceo valu will decreas 30 to 50 percent in the 16m case size reduct is not be provid so the equip price will be stabl thi equip improv throughput and avail for exampl the wafer conveyor time which constitut more than half of tact time will be cut in half in order to improv throughput by a factor of 1 3 and avail will be improv by decreas the number of part so that period mainten will need to be perform less frequent in the 64m case the hope is for a breakthrough that will improv product while provid size reduct for exampl stepper have appear with 2 to 1 size reduct and doubl the throughput unlik the case of 5 to 1 stepper a great improv is expect just by loosen the design rule etcher robot wait time cut by a factor of three on of the three worst etcher have now appear for 16m that reduc the ceo valu by 30 percent from 520 per wafer for previou equip to 400 per wafer sematech show coo and ceo valu as dollar per wafer but here we have convert thi to yen per wafer for japanes manufactur appli materi amat of america is sell the p 5000 mark ii j etch mxp which lower the ceo valu by keep the price the same improv avail 10 percent and improv throughput 20 percent figur 3 the price is about 200 million and sale began in japan in octob the improv in avail wa achiev by reduc the gener particl by an order of

with attach round us the most appropri blow hole for the ga suppli and switch to a hot wall method the improv in avail also includ a 12 5 percent improv in mtbf mean time between failur thi is the averag time from the occurr of on failur to the occurr of the next failur over earlier equip and an improv in mttr mean time to repair by 22 percent thi is the averag time from the occurr of a failur until it is repair mtbf improv becaus the number of part within the chamber decreas throughput wa increas by decreas the convei time which is more than half of the tact time the conveyor speed wa increas by a factor of three when not wait for a wafer in the futur robot will be us that can hold two wafer simultan and the convei speed will be made even faster graphic capt figur 3 an etcher with

as previou machin while the avail ha been increas 10 percent and the throughput 50 percent the improv in avail wa achiev by reduc the hundr of move part by about 50 the improv in throughput wa achiev by shorten the vacuum exhaust time which accord to lsi manufactur took up between 40 and 50 percent of the tact time the exhaust time wa cut in half by perform load and unload simultan thi wa achiev by develop robot that could hold two wafer simultan previou robot were improv rather than develop new on the z 1000 sputter introduc by nihon shinku reduc the ceo valu from 660 to 330 per wafer while slightli reduc the price to 170 million the avail wa improv 40 percent and the throughput wa improv 50 percent the improv in avail wa achiev by cut in half the number of part which had been 4500 site of particl gener were reduc and the area of the nonstick board within the chamber wa reduc by an order of magnitud the improv in throughput wa due to a 40 percent reduct in convei time nihon shinku accomplish thi by chang from the previou belt drive method to a frog leg method graphic capt figur 4 product is higher for a low pressur method than for a collim on product cannot be maintain with a

cvd atp 5800 reduc the ceo valu to 400 per wafer thei found it difficult to improv avail so thei increas the throughput by 60 percent the price of about 200 million is the same as befor thei investig improv in avail by in situ clean but gave up on that idea becaus thei felt that the price increas of 10 million wa not worth the small improv in the ceo throughput went up 25 point by increas the number of process chamber from four to five and 30 point more by chang the convei method the rectangular shape of prior equip wa chang to a polygon form without much increas in the area occupi by the equip the convei speed wa increas while chang from linear motion to circular motion vertic furnac first realiz an increas in the number of charg kokusai electr ha announc two new 16m vertic furnac on with sale begin in januari 1994 and the other in the second quarter of 1994 these reduc the ceo valu over previou equip by 30 percent and 50 percent respect for the case of field oxid unfortun howev it is the polici of kokusai electr not to announc the absolut number for the ceo valu the vertic furnac v iiie with a 30 percent lower ceo valu increas throughput by increas the number of charg thei said that the avail wa alreadi so good that it could have littl effect on improv the ceo valu the vertic furnac v iiif with a 50 percent lower ceo valu decreas the tact time of the v iiie kokusai electr plan to invest most heavili in thi product for 16m the v iiie is avail for user who need an earlier deliveri date both the v iiie and v iiif increas the number of charg from 100 to 150 the convei time increas but thi convei time is still onli 10 minut as compar with the four hour requir for the field oxid process so there realli is littl effect on the tact time the larger number of charg is achiev by increas the length of the heater from 1200mm to 1350mm and the height of the equip from 2800mm to 3100mm the v iiif plan to decreas the tact time by reduc the process time from 4

nihon shinku will market the idz 8800 ion implant equip that cut the ceo in half from 500 per wafer to 250 per wafer thei have given up the parallel method of vertic implant ion in the wafer surfac and return to the previou scan method thei return to the scan method to lower the cost becaus half the cost of the equip wa in the part need for parallel the price is 200 million nihon shinku develop the new equip after investig perform togeth with lsi manufactur had shown that the parallel equip is onli need 10 to 20 percent of the time howev lsi factori usual have a tendenc to purchas sever of the same type of equip so that an equip failur doe not stop the entir line a question is whether thi will continu to be the case even without the parallel equip the throughput ha increas to 280 wafer per hour on wafer is alreadi be convei while anoth on is be process in the futur the convei time should not be a factor at all and it should be possibl to have 360 wafer per hour dainippon screen

product line that invest in bubbl technolog went exclus to 5 to 1 stepper the appear of 2 to 1 stepper now is for the purpos of reduc the cost of the exposur process of cours the ceo valu is much lower for magnifi expos than for stepper therefor some lsi manufactur ar look for stepper that can be us as magnifi expos in process that have flexibl design rule such as ion implant process or bond

FBIS4-67574: bfn viktor litovkin report the sunken komsomolet put out so signal text sergei khetagurov deputi minist for emerg situat ha told an interfax correspond that 15 june thi year the ministri will mount an expedit to the site of the disast involv the russian nuclear power submarin komsomolet which sank in the norwegian sea in april 1989 the purpos of the two month expedit aboard the research ship akademik keldysh is to seal the torpedo tube hatch the submarin ha two torpedo on board with nuclear warhead and these fill specialist with the greatest apprehens the deputi minist said it is imposs to rule out in principl a possibl spread of radioact as a result of corros of their case he believ at the veri same time academician vladimir zuyev depart head at the russian academi of scienc institut of oceanolog ha sent a letter to the russian presid s staff he report that despit the real possibl of a vollei discharg of weapon grade plutonium into the marin environ from the sunken komsomolet the expedit to it and the actual seal of the vessel ar in jeopardi lead specialist with rich experi of underwat work have been taken off it the necessari ecolog expert apprais ha not been carri out there is no feder program for the reliabl corros proof of an increas sourc of radioact danger and the necessari financi resourc have not yet been alloc to thi what is the problem here why doe the situat with regard to the sunken komsomolet elicit such increas attent and such contradictori assess sever nuclear power ship have sunk in recent year and so much radioact wast ha been dump in the ocean that the possibl of a leak of plutonium from two torpedo appear a mere trifl compar with the constant discharg of radiat from these graveyard dr of technic scienc tengiz borisov former chairman of the committe for carri out special purpos underwat work whose function have now been transfer to the ministri for emerg situat believ that thi is not quit the case the question of ensur the komsomolet radiat safeti is far more seriou than other similar tragic instanc there ar sever reason first the submarin li off the coast of norwai in norwai s tradit fish ground the discharg of plutonium into the water and trace of it were alreadi detect last year although thei do not yet exce the background valu could depriv that countri of fisheri for hundr of year destroi the modern fish process industri depriv ten of thousand of peopl of their livelihood and as a consequ drastic undermin russia s prestig and forc it to pai compens run into mani million in foreign currenc second russia it leadership and it specialist still have the technic and econom possibl of prevent the radiat pollut of the ocean corros proof the sunken vessel and deliv europ from the threat of an ecolog disast but preciou time must not be lost here we ar left with virtual the last chanc of carri out the work thi summer there will not be anoth opportun the torpedo beryllium case ar bound to break up within the next few month and then all effort will be in vain true not all the specialist familiar with the situat on the submarin share the anxieti of tengiz borisov hi colleagu at the institut of oceanolog or other scientist and practic underwat worker some of them mainli employe of the ministri for emerg situat maintain that fish is not conduct at a depth of 1 700 meter where the komsomolet li and so there is simpli no threat that plutonium will get into the fish diet and thenc onto peopl s tabl in addit thei sai in the opinion of nuclear scientist at the scientif research institut of experiment physic at arzama 16 where the torpedo nuclear warhead were creat the discharg of plutonium follow the destruct of the torpedo case will not have appreci radiat consequ either for the popul or for the fauna if a 100 percent discharg doe occur all the materi will settl in a compact stain between 30 and 400 km long at the same time the radiat dose will be virtual insignific at the far limit of the seat of radiat the izvestiya editori offic ha a copi of thi opinion of the scientif research institut of experiment physic approv by academician yurii trutnev and stanislav voronin of the russian academi of scienc the chief design of nuclear warhead it conclus do not coincid with those reach at the ministri for emerg situat it is not yet clear the scientist write whether the uncertainti that exist at the present time in the estim of seab pollut by the fission product of plutonium corros can affect the global conclus that the escap of plutonium from the nuclear weapon as their insul case is destroi ha no appreci radioact consequ further it is necessari to make a more detail assess of the possibl movement of plutonium from the bed to surfac layer as a consequ of the season migrat of plankton which winter on the bed and the compet process of spread of the plankton patch on the lift of plutonium build up from seab deposit if we translat the scientist word into simpl languag understand to everyon it becom clear that larg area of plankton plaster with the decomposit product of nuclear warhead or rather precis plutonium have zero buoyanc thei can be move by underwat current ani distanc from the scene of the tragedi and thu end up ultim in the food of someon live thousand of kilomet from the norwegian sea the academician believ that it would be prematur to conclud that in work with the nuclear power submarin komsomolet it is possibl to confin ourselv just to radiat monitor everyth must be done to make naval weapon system safe bear the possibl of accid in mind a similar conclus wa reach by the russian secur council interdepartment commiss on ecolog safeti which discuss thi problem at the end of last year what then is prevent thi from be done todai particularli as the ministri for emerg situat as sergei khetagurov declar is readi and ha plan to carri out the special expedit to seal the stricken submarin in the opinion of mani specialist with whom i have spoken about thi work on corros proof the sunken submarin is be hinder by department differ and by ambit which no less than the actual corros ar eat awai at formerli amic and unit collect the peopl who last year organ and carri out the uniqu deep water experi in the norwegian sea who ascertain and analyz the actual condit of the sunken vessel and it system and who us uniqu

europ s share will rise from 15 to 20 per cent the us will mark time at about 6 per cent and the rest of the world will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent the biggest growth area is asia which is good new for the japanes produc but europ sai mr demark is also veri interest and the compani s home base f s see the european market rise from dollar 330m in 1990 to dollar 687m in 1996 with

best sale penetr abb is probabl justifi in claim that it offer more servic and support to european buyer than the more product base approach of the japanes but dr clark wonder whether thi will still be true in two year time on the other hand europ he sai is probabl not on of the japanes produc prioriti given the better growth prospect in the asia pacif region as for the balanc of power in the industri both abb and the japanes ar grow stronger the big produc ar get bigger and the smaller robot compani particularli in the us and uk ar concentr on nich and ancillari servic if the big produc

such rule there ar two view on safeti sai davi on is that it s accept to start out with an industri robot provid you put in a top level softwar system to bring the thing to a halt in the event of some failur but in my view that s not safe enough i think you need to re develop the robot from the basic servo level upward build in safeti at everi level that mean give the surgic robot the equival of a metal cage with duplic softwar and hardwar constraint to prevent it move beyond pre defin limit and it must move slowli enough for the supervis surgeon s hand to hit the stop button in time to avoid damag if all the safeti system fail demonstr safeti is not enough though grow concern about the financi cost of medic care ar forc both public health author and privat hospit to demand evid that new

over as manag of thi small plant is continu the tradit of hi predecessor robert thompson who took it upon himself without ani goad from upper manag to work a shift on the line at least onc a month probabl more manag at gm should do thi sai rucker clad in a sweat soak blue t shirt and blue jean as he take a short break from hi job in the plant s bodi shop hang door and weld metal panel on buick s new luxuri two seat model if you don t understand what s go on out here on the floor you can make the wrong decis and you also might develop a fear about not know what s realli go on thi wai you come to understand that the peopl on the line ar regular gui just like you show of interest after some initi misgiv most of the plant s union offici and hourli worker now eagerli await the boss time on the shop floor while a few worker grumbl that the plant manag s time on the floor is littl more than a public stunt most sai it show that manag realli care about them by have the plant manag come

ar you and you knew thei didn t mean it but now when thei talk about teamwork in the plant thi prove thei mean it local union leader like the arrang becaus thei get to choos where the boss work each time thei have tri to give thompson and rucker some of the toughest job in the plant job that worker have been complain about so the manag can get firsthand experi with the most troublesom problem that reatta worker face each dai you get much faster feedback on problem when he s out there like that sai ross sherman presid of unit auto worker local 1618 which repres the reatta plant s 630 hourli worker now the peopl beg us to send him to them so that thei can get their problem fix but rucker s time on the floor is just on of the mani innov labor practic that the reatta plant is now pioneer todai it is the onli auto plant in the nation that ha done awai with mani aspect of the tradit assembl line becaus buick onli plan to sell a few thousand reatta each year the plant ha been design to build onli about six car an hour compar to 60 per hour in a typic auto factori as a result gm ha been abl to take a slow craft approach to car product here the bodi shop where rucker work hi shift is on of the few area of the plant that still run on a tradit assembl line much of the assembl work is instead conduct at 14 craft center where team of worker perform a wide varieti of task when thei ar finish worker signal a robot cart carri the car bodi to take it to the next craft station so rather than handl just on or two highli repetit and monoton function the wai worker on a typic assembl line do mani reatta worker get the sens that thei ar actual hand build car in fact thi is the onli plant in gm where the offici job descript for an assembl worker is that of craftsman gm offici credit the craft center approach with help the reatta plant gain some of the best qualiti grade of ani gm assembl plant over the past year in fact the reatta plant ha been run neck and neck on qualiti with the gm toyota joint ventur plant in fremont for first place in gm intern qualiti audit of it plant the onli problem the reatta hasn t been sell as well as expect mani insid gm blame a poor advertis and market effort by buick for the fact that reatta sale have been far below the compani s initi forecast although buick offici sai thei ar now pleas with reatta sale which ar expect to total between 7 000 and 8 000 in the 1989 model year 97 worker were laid off at the reatta plant in januari when product wa cut back from 56 car per dai to 42 slow the line still gm seem commit to the reatta and to the experiment approach be follow on the factori floor here so rucker plan to come back each month for hi shift on the floor but hi supervisor can onli hope that he get the hang of the intric

peopl actual came to rest on the bottom of the ocean their shoe ar still there shoe all over the bismarck boot all over the place anim won t eat process leather thei eat the bodi and the cloth but thei won t eat the leather oceanograph ballard in lo angel to announc that he will host a televis seri about underwat explor and other scientif ventur is somewher in the middl of a long explan about why he pursu the sunken past with such avid partli he conced it s for the sensat that onli discoveri can provid the moment of discoveri i think the thrill of explor is to see someth to be the first to set ey on someth that ha never been seen befor he sai the first time i saw the titan wow there it wa thi monstrou ship just came out of the gloom and there it wa for ballard the moment of discoveri is intellectu kinet an instant when he connect palpabl with histori the best experi that i can give that s sort of an analog is like go to custer s last stand he sai to go and stand where custer stood and imagin you know bad dai to be in the cavalri that s the sens it s your hallow ground you sens crazi hors there and you just realiz the hopeless of the situat well when you re out at the titan and all of a sudden it happen right here it s no longer abstract unknown territori scientif and histor ha been ballard s countri for more than two decad perhap even as far back as hi childhood in southern california when he wa smitten by account of african explor and becam captiv by the pacif ocean now four year after the discoveri of the titan catapult him from mere well known scientist to global fame the 47 year old seem to be in the throe of anoth transform thi time around he appar is eager to shape both the futur and the past with the technolog that he develop in more than a decad of underwat explor furthermor he plan to us hi new tool as the new host of nation geograph explor a weekli two hour program produc by nation geograph and turner broadcast system inc it is the kind of popular of scienc that ballard ha been critic for in the past by hi peer but ballard sai he see hi metamorphosi into tv person as an educ mission that mai help convinc children that scienc is a contact sport discuss the search for the bismarck ballard obvious savor the contact with histori and scienc becaus the bismarck wa engag in a run battl hundr of mile from land when it sank neither the british nor the german were abl or much interest in keep precis record of their locat so ballard s expedit had to search about 150 squar mile of ocean floor initi with sonar and then with remot control computer robot sensor and camera control from a surfac ship befor locat the wreck june 8 thi kind of explor isn t cheap ballard note joke that we had 100 000 pound of equip and 10 van and six robot and a partridg in a pear tree you have to understand that the bismarck battl wa wage in a forc 8 sea 50 knot wind 15 foot wave with overcast and no celesti navig ballard sai the search for the bismarck which like the titan sank on it maiden voyag wa further complic by the natur of the atlant ocean the battleship wa in 16 000 feet of water and it wa in a mountain rang ballard sai not without enthusiasm it wa in an aw place and it wa in the northern latitud up at 48 degre north latitud which is not a nice stretch of ocean ever even in the summer despit the difficulti ballard wa drawn to the wreck becaus like the titan it is on of the most famou lost chunk of histori to litter the ocean floor i do it becaus of the challeng to do it he sai but i m also interest in the fact that thi ship is well preserv there is probabl more histori preserv in the deep ocean of the world than in all the museum of the world although it ha lost it gun turret and wa hit by numer shell and torpedo the bismarck still ha touch of fresh ballard add cite the huge paint swastika on the ship s bow and stern in it dai the 50 000 ton bismarck with heavi armor eight 15 inch gun capabl of fire on ton shell 24 mile and high perform diesel engin wa on of the most power warship afloat and briefli it prove to be just that slip out of it home port of danzig now gdynia on mai 18 1941 to attack alli convoi the bismarck soon had much of the british royal navi look for it at the time england face a victori germani alon and wa depend on convoi from america for most of it food and war materi discov by two british heavi cruiser on mai 23 the bismarck wa engag the next dai by two other british warship from a distanc of 25 000 yard the bismarck s huge shell hit the hood start a fire in an ammunit locker within minut the hood explod kill all but three of the ship s 1 400 crew member the princ of wale wa also damag of the bismarck the british were lucki to get it to the bottom ballard claim in the climact battl a freak hit by a torpedo launch from a vintag world war i biplan knock out the bismarck s steer forc the crippl battleship to wait for the british to come and get it of cours the british came and the bismarck wa sunk in the atlant about 600 mile west of franc sinc the discoveri of the bismarck ballard sai there ha been curios about what actual caus the ship to sink british firepow or scuttl by her own crew but ballard believ the evid make the point moot the british warship had order to sink the bismarck not captur it and the german were under order not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war prize he sai at 10 a m on mai 27 the captain of the bismarck order hi crew to open the seacock on hi disabl ship thu flood the hull ballard recount about 10 30 a m the bismarck wa hit by three torpedo from the british cruiser dorsetshir and sank three minut later bismarck s survivor so it wa on it wai down and the torpedo help but it wa on it wai down ballard sai if thei hadn t open the seacock i m convinc the british would have sat there and plunk torpedo into it until it sank so it s sort of academ who sank it onli about 100 of the bismarck s crew surviv nearli 2 300 perish includ sever hundr who were swim in the water after their ship disappear it is that moment that seem to galvan ballard when the bismarck sank approxim 800 live soul went into the water and were aliv after the ship went under he sai lean forward in hi chair and the dorsetshir came in and began pick up survivor and then someon thought thei saw a periscop and thei took off and thei left 700 peopl in the water aliv can you imagin the aw the hopeless the despair of the sailor who s just had a ship blown out from underneath him he s paddl and freez to death in thi water and salvat is right there and he s grab hold of the hull and the ship take off ballard ha said he will not reveal the exact locat of the bismarck except to german author as a ship of war the battleship belong to germani he sai although there might be some debat about which half of that divid countri would have the more legitim claim as with the titan ballard sai he strongli believ that such rel recent wreck should be left undisturb memori to those who perish as for wreck from the dim reach of the past ballard argu that thei should be explor onli by qualifi archeologist intent on broaden histor knowledg in fact he still becom visibl angri that privat expedit to the titan took some artifact from the wreck develop deep sea robot but ballard seem to be chiefli an enthusiast not a critic in particular he is a propon of machin especi robot ballard ha head up the develop of a system of deep sea unman robot call the argo jason system equip with camera and other sens devic the robot ar now capabl of plumb the world s deep water faster and more safe than the tini slow man submarin that previous were the cut edg of ocean research and explor he sai while an unman robot name jason jr wa us in a 1986 expedit to the titan it wa onli within the last few month that the leap wa made to fulli robot explor ballard sai mean that robot can now be direct from a surfac ship rather than from a man submarin via a control cabl it s a relief that he and other won t have to spend five or more hour per dai commut to the ocean floor which averag 12 000 feet in depth he sai even though he ha spent a lot of time in cramp research submarin and probabl will spend more ballard is mif by the ineffici of the romant littl gui refer to the small submarin he explain you re spend five hour a dai freez to death in thi littl sphere our averag dive time on the titan wa three hour a dai three hour out of 24 and you ve got 50 peopl and you ve got on gui look out of a window more interest in scienc ballard ha been talk about the potenti of thi technolog for year but recent advanc have made him more convinc than ever that the concept of telepres will revolution not onli undersea explor but the wai mani peopl travel more import he see the technolog as capabl of rekindl interest in scienc among american schoolchildren we re now reach a point in technolog in imag devic both acoust and visual fiber optic

where i don t feel profession inconvenienc by live in montana how much time he actual will spend in northern montana is an open question though given the demand of the explor televis seri with the seri includ a program on the bismarck to be broadcast in late octob ballard assert that he can do hi bit to instil a respect for the past and take million on magic mysteri tour of the kingdom under the sea 70 of the planet s under water we ve seen less than 1 of 1 i mean we know more about the mountain rang on mar than the mountain rang of our own planet he sai the vast unknown it is thi sens of

have inherit a rock solid busi rocketdyn s order backlog thi year alon jump 500 million to 3 billion and it 1989 sale top 1 billion for the first time the divis which first set up shop in the san fernando vallei in the earli 1950s and is now base in canoga park count 9 500 employe and expect to add 500 worker next year all thi come at a time when other aerospac compani ar slash their work forc rocketdyn s advantag is that 75 of it busi is so call commerci work such as the nasa oper shuttl and ha been exempt thu far from the defens spend slowdown that is forc other compani to cut employ we re not in the tank busi we re in the busi of space system said paster who becam presid in octob while feder spend for some defens program is be cut spend for space program jump 16 in the fiscal year that began oct 1 to 12 4 billion but paster 49 feel pressur anywai he can t count on similar spend gain for space in the futur becaus budget deficit problem could pare fund for rocketdyn s pet project for instanc rocketdyn ha built engin for everi space shuttl but even that could chang on dai three year ago nasa award a 198 million contract to pratt whitnei to develop a new turbopump for the shuttl s main engin that is a pump that would outperform the current on built by rocketdyn the pump forc fuel through the engin at high speed pratt whitnei a unit of unit technolog is about to begin test it version of the product the contract signal that rocketdyn could not take the shuttl engin program for grant said wolfgang h demisch an aerospac analyst for ub secur in new york clearli there will be more competit he said also rocketdyn is not total exempt from defens spend cutback becaus the militari is a major user of the rocket that rocketdyn design engin for said paul h nisbet an aerospac analyst with prudenti bach secur in new york the commerci program as thei ar call ar larg support by the militari he said so paster s task is to secur more new project and keep those it alreadi ha so that rocketdyn maintain it momentum we mai not grow as fast as we want to grow but i don t see us go into a decai unless someth unforeseen happen he said to land contract he must deliv current order as promis correctli built on time and within budget otherwis rocketdyn risk jeopard the willing of congress and the public to continu pai for the project for exampl on of rocketdyn s new project is a

govern award which ar paid depend on how well rocketdyn doe it job in a good year the award can total in the million of dollar to keep program as effici as possibl rocketdyn and nasa togeth have spent 100 million in recent year to instal robot and otherwis modern the compani s plant to cut rocketdyn s product cost rocketdyn produc a shuttl engin that cost nasa 34 million down from 45 million origin and paster want each engin to sell for 25 million in 1992 93 the robot reduct in the hundr of weld need to assembl the engin and other improv enabl rocketdyn to cut the engin s cost a project rocketdyn would like to win is to build the engin for a propos advanc launch system or al the system would be an unman expend rocket capabl of launch up to 200 000 pound worth of cargo compar with the 55 000 pound limit of the shuttl paster said the al is meant to be built at much lower cost than the power rocket engin that sent astronaut to the moon the govern want the cost for the al to be between 300 and 500 per pound launch compar with more than 2 000 per pound on current unman rocket todai rocketdyn is compet against pratt whitnei and a third compani aerojet gener a unit of gencorp

compani mcdonnel dougla gener dynam and martin marietta corp ar expect to domin the commerci busi that rocketdyn make engin for two of the big three compani is on reason for it gain in backlog and employ but paster also can t sit back and wait for the govern to send monei if he want to foster rocketdyn s growth he s got to keep hustl for contract consid rocketdyn wa not origin ask to bid on develop engin for the propos nation aerospac plane or nasp a hyperson jet that would be capabl of fly from washington to tokyo in two hour rocketdyn went ahead and spent million of dollar design nasp engin concept that caught the attent of feder offici and it s now vy with pratt whitnei to build engin for that plane as well there s no guarante that the govern will want to build more than the on experiment nasp model it ha order for 3 3 billion even if work continu scientist have said a commerci version of the plane could not be built until at least the year 2020 still paster had to act or

will go on as the us govern sort out which space program it can afford and rocketdyn tri to win a bigger share of the space market we ve been veri success the last sever year he said i m not go to come in here and turn rocketdyn insid out
