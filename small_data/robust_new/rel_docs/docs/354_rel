sinc that time been fight for the creation of a unifi and independ state thi struggl is be conduct by the nation liber front under the leadership of the kurdistan worker parti pkk mikhaylov doe the liber movement adher to a common strategi and tactic in all four area kadyr no in iraqi kurdistan the struggl began in 1960 but unfortun it wa conduct not for freedom and independ but for the right of autonomi when thi autonomi wa promis therefor the iraqi kurd came to trust the countri s leadership as a result baghdad need have no fear of them and wa abl to concentr fulli on the war with iran when the war wa over howev the iraqi armi like the iranian armi also for that matter struck at the kurd 1 400 villag were destroi and 600 000 refuge left their home and the rest were herd into strateg

the polic not do their duti of maintain law and order bishop thei were told about the mandela interrupt whether we want the polic to be with us or not is irrelev the polic should not allow ani peopl

whatev we sai must be influenc by the idea of build a new south africa and unit our peopl bishop have you got anyth to give us tonight about stop the violenc i mean if you had the opportun to put it in a nutshel and fix it what would you do mandela well we ar not the govern you must understand the task of maintain law and order is that of the govern not of the anc we have no state power we have no arm we have no caspir and violenc can onli be effect address by peopl who have these mean but within our capac we have tri to the best of our abil as an organ to support the effort which ar made by a wide varieti of organ for peac we will continu to do so and that is why we ar talk to all polit parti those insid the negoti process and those who stand outsid becaus we want to avoid ani danger of a civil war in thi countri bishop well that s taken as is but it s also said by some of your critic that some of the sdu self defens unit some of those young men have run out of control you see in the headlin mafia group maverick young men sdu out of the control of the anc comment mandela the problem about the sdu onli occur within the last six month peopl have been dy long befor that you must rememb that we ar deal with a govern which ha a cultur of intoler freedom fighter have been dy sinc the earli 60s there ar no less than about 200 peopl who have di in polic custodi from the 60s and a statement which wa made by the late dr gluckman who had the opportun to deal with these case a number of other freedom fighter like neil argot and richard turner the goniw all these were kill long befor we had ani complaint about the sdu the complaint against the sdu is made primarili by the govern and the nation parti in order to divert attent from their own crimin neglig bishop but not entir haven t you come and said at least the anc came out and said and admit that some of those sdu ar out of control mandela no you must put the matter in proper context we have had the courag and honesti to sai to the public that we have problem with sdu but you must understand that the sdu ar a commun base organ to protect the mass of the peopl after the govern ha fail to do it duti and after the peopl have lost their belong thei have come out in order to provid some measur of protect to the commun bishop i think that s gener known but it s been suggest that now you should instruct if that s the word some of your veri senior men perhap in umkhonto we sizw spear of the nation anc militari wing who have high profil to go in there and sort it out mandela we have been there sort thing out last tuesdai we had that 10 hour meet with the sdu in that area involv not onli the anc but the south african communist parti cosatu congress of south african trade union the mass democrat movement and i ask you what ha the govern done to address the question of violenc bishop befor we move awai from thi violenc the heidelberg massacr the continu attack on civilian the ever rise crime rate again i ask what can we do text mandela we ar against ani form of terror and what ha happen recent in connect with the tavern attack is a matter that is go to be discuss by the transit execut council tec we ar against ani form of thuggeri and we have condemn it publicli in the strongest term bishop the tec now ha some muscl if i can us that paus i mean it is an establish organ and you ve been address the question of violenc i think we ar talk about a nation peacekeep forc we ar talk about an integr sap sadf south african polic south african defens forc umkhonto we sizw and other group how far off ar we from that becaus it strike me mandela interrupt befor i deal with that let me just tell you about the report which wa made by the commission of polic from natal a report which ha been tabl befor the tec in that report he mention that befor the festiv season he drew the attent of the govern to the instabl in natal and felt that becaus the migrant were go back to natal thi might creat problem and aggrav the whole question of violenc he also got a legal opinion from senior council which show that the south african polic can go into natal and into the homeland without ani restrict thei ar free to do so bishop legal mandela legal and he also went further and identifi area where the ifp inkatha freedom parti and the kwazulu polic were respons for thi violenc and he mention that there wa a self defens unit in on area which wa alleg also to be involv in violenc but he wa honest and he said that there wa no concret evid to support thi alleg now that is a statement from a commission of polic in natal and you must therefor look at the whole question of the sdu from the point of view that we ar face an extraordinari situat where the govern is work with crimin in order to destabil the peopl in that region bishop let s leav that now but stai in that region and ask you when ar you and chief minist mangosuthu buthelezi go to fix thing up mandela well i have met chief buthelezi on three differ occas i have done everyth in my power to persuad him to come back and negoti with us but it is a fals premis to think that thi violenc can be address by two peopl meet in no govern in a countri anywher in the world will a govern refrain from take step to maintain law and order and reli on two individu you don t find that anywher it is the task of the govern to ensur that violenc is stop and that the slaughter of innoc peopl is immedi address by the govern and settl bishop do you still sai that you will go ahead with the elect regardless of whether the freedom allianc is on board mandela we will persuad the freedom allianc to join in negoti and to take part in the elect bishop can you do that mandela i am discuss with the ultra right i have met gener viljoen dr ferdi hartzenberg mr dri bruwer and i am discuss the whole question of the violenc their demand for a separ volkstaat nation state and their particip in the elect i do so becaus it is absolut necessari for all section of our popul for all nation group to speak with on voic on the major nation issu face the countri bishop just seven minut left i have so much to ask you mr mandela let s talk about the possibl that your parti will probabl might whatev the express is win the elect let s make the presumpt that you do what kind of a south africa as far as the economi will we have you have done awai with the idea of nation but we hear a lot of talk about redistribut of wealth a wealth tax and so forth so what can be expect in that area mandela we ar not concern with label our primari object is to address the social econom problem face our peopl the question of unemploy which is 50 percent of the econom activ popul of the countri lack of hous lack of educ and medic facil and that is our object that must be done by ensur that the resourc of the countri ar equal avail to all south african irrespect of color or creed and that is what we intend do bishop but that requir monei doesn t it and some economist ar sai it requir free market style gener monei no more talk of a marxist lenin command economi comment mandela we have never talk about a marxist economi as the african nation congress the peopl who sai that we were onc commit to a marxist economi ar either sai so becaus of ignor or out of malic our concern is not to adopt ani pattern from ani other countri it is to address the real problem face our countri and these ar the problem i have refer to we ar alreadi as a polit organ far advanc in see organ like the intern monetari fund with whose presid i met in septemb thi year as heard we have met the world bank on sever occas to discuss the question of resourc to be abl to address thi problem i have met presid like mr bill clinton prime minist major presid mitterand and all of them i m discuss question among other of resourc so that we can address the problem i have refer to bishop what ar the assur you ar give these top peopl about the economi ar you sai don t worri invest in profit out no problem mandela we ar brief them on the step that we have taken to attract invest i have point out to them that in mai 1992 we issu an invest guid in which we guarante all investor against the confisc of their properti secondli that thei will be entitl to repatri their profit and dividend and that if an investor sold hi busi activ in the countri he will be entitl to repatri them bishop sorri i ve got to rush everyth up so much to ask quickli the question of freedom of express and in particular the control of the sabc south african broadcast corpor it s been said in certain quarter that the anc now control the sabc that the nation parti control it befor now it s the anc doe it control the sabc mandela i don t think so thi is a board that wa set up by an independ select panel compos of south african of the highest integr thei ar not member of the anc and thei could not set up a board which is compos of member of the anc bishop but thei ar point to three promin and highli profession peopl who ar close connect to the anc and who ve just join the sabc comment mandela well i think that as far as i m awar if you ar talk about the three person that i know thei have been select becaus of their merit not becaus of associ with ani polit organ bishop to cut it short you wouldn t chang thought let s sai you were the leader of the countri in three or four month you wouldn t lift the phone and tell new editor and other peopl what to do mandela the democrat cultur is veri much entrench in the african nation congress we believ in an independ media becaus we would like to look at the media as a mirror to see how we ar function and to control the media would be contrari to the fundament principl of democraci and it is for that that we have attack the nation parti s control of the sabc bishop move to anoth matter veri quickli in the time left the afrikan what is wrong if a group of afrikan sincer want to move awai and live on their own mandela we ar against ethnic solut bishop why mandela we have fought the bantustan system and we have now overthrown that system even the nationalist govern which wa the onli govern which recogn the bantustan ha now agre and a claus ha been entrench in our constitut that all the bantustan all the homeland self govern and independ must now be reincorpor into south africa if we made an except and gave in to the demand of the afrikan for a volkstaat nation state we would be reopen the same thing all the bantustan would put forward similar claim and you will break up south africa into a number of differ polit entiti which would destroi our economi bishop just a few second left what kind of messag would you send now at thi point in our histori mandela we would like the spirit of reconcili to be accept by all south african bishop not reveng mandela no we have made the point veri clearli that we ar not here for retribut we ar here to try and contribut to the build of a new south africa bishop mr

last week not to anger him on the ground that he would not forgiv chang the subject the fact is that the state secur court have been establish to prevent crime against the state in the word of presid suleyman demirel the aim of creat these court wa to take swift action against crimin who had target the state the normal court were in a bottleneck he explain in a recent interview crimin were just walk out then on can assum that the dgm state secur court ar not normal court and that thei have been creat to prevent crimin from walk out in other word although offici argu that the dgm ar as imparti as other court thei also confess that thei have a special duti to keep the crimin in and sinc the crime of opinion exist in turkei and the peopl themselv have littl toler to other with differ opinion such court have been extrem success in keep opinion crimin insid such crime technic can be commit in onli two form and at that turkei ha someth to be proud of for instanc on cannot be charg or imprison for onli think of someth without express it thu the crime can be commit in the verbal and written form put such opinion into write can be a crime voic such opinion can also be a crime mehdi zana a former mayor for diyarbakir is in jail for speak at the european parliament in 1992 two turkish mp of kurdish origin face possibl capit punish for speak befor the helsinki commiss and so on demir himself explain last week in anoth hurriyet interview when ask whether he read book that thei mostli read obscen book accord to him the dgm prosecutor read the book word by word to see whether the opinion behind those word constitut a crime that is when the charg ar brought up charg at a state secur court establish mainli to prevent crime against the state the author of dgm is inde too vast and widespread it can be exploit in everi wai depend on the individu in charg of the prosecut meanwhil speak of independ justic on need to note that at least on of ankara dgk chief prosecutor is a militari offic with all personnel record attach to the chief of staff and there ar polit demir for instanc make it no secret that he person believ the turkish race come from the grei wolv a symbol us by the extrem rightist and so on polit speak on ha also to ask how the constitut court took last thursdai s decis and under which circumst why for instanc did everyon in the tdn turkish daili new alreadi know hour in advanc on thursdai morn that the decis for closur would be pass that dai and that the court wa under pressur to do so as soon as possibl how did we know thi how come the inform which reach us seem to be true how imparti is such a decis which carefulli maintain the parliamentari statu of four deputi thu close the door for a by elect the coincid ar too great it is not veri long sinc parliament act in a similar hast and although it had the file for on and a half year lift the immun of eight deputi in a matter of hour it is worth rememb that the action wa taken onli after gen dogan gure point the finger at parliament and said why should we look for the bandit on the mountain while thei ar in parliament never befor asid from militari coup regim ha the credibl and respect of the turkish parliament been erod so much by state offici think of a countri where an armi gener can publicli go on the record accus an elect parliament of banditri where a polic chief can order a besieg of thi almost holi compound and where a prosecutor can call member of parliament who still maintain their mp statu as terrorist and ban their exit from turkei moreov think of thi countri where secur forc have evacu and burn down over 900 villag where at least 50 journalist ar in prison where writer publish and newsmen ar arrest almost everi week where economist and academician ar place behind bar onli for express their view and where death squad roam the street to abduct tortur and kill kurdish origin businessmen and activist the nation s assembl is the turkish express we us to describ our parliament an assembl where the peopl send their elect repres to speak on their behalf an assembl in which when we hear thing we don t want said we move against those peopl these dai it appear that through some peopl s action turkei s credibl abroad is at stake and their movement ar a black mark against the whole nation meanwhil parliament itself is lose it remain influenc recent remark made by some veri high level state offici impli that thei have lost all faith in parliamentari democraci themselv that thei neither respect nor give ani valu to parliament more import though is that the behaviour of some of these offici is hurt turkei abroad overshadow it credibl and help the terrorist under normal circumst these could be regard as seriou crime as well for year i have argu that turkei s polici in the southeast ha help recruit for the terrorist and that the pkk strength is ow mainli to polici mistak more than anyth els for year i have argu with dep politician and those on the legal platform that their withdraw from polit would hurt turkei that the onli legal altern to the pkk should be given the chanc to surviv and that thi histor opportun should not be wast now there is no need to argu anymor these dai it appear that a new step is be taken on which is not onli incred serv to give legitimaci to illeg but on which in a crucial post august era where turkei s overal fate is attach will further boost the crisi turkei face look at the recent develop the onli hope on can have is for two separ polit effort continu outsid of the dep to gain momentum and at least be toler current former minist serafettin elci is try to establish a conserv parti anoth kurdish activist turn poet kemal burkai is also try to set up an independ polit parti the dep closur mai have given wai to further argument on turkish democraci but whatev ha happen thi doe not mean all door ar close everyon is awar of how provoc the dep ha been and how much it ha fan turkish anger against the kurdish movement in gener even sedat yurtta spoke of these mistak over the weekend now howev there is a chanc for those peopl without mistak to make an appear on the polit scene and thi ha to be regard as a last minut chanc for turkei as much as the activist in thi field what fate these new and extrem moder activist will have is anoth issu and on which appear to close depend on intern reaction to the dep case if those rule turkei behind the scene ar given the correct messag thi could at least creat the begin of an atmospher of toler the hard liner for some time have argu that the dep brought troubl on itself and that it wa the prefer of a major of turk to punish the parti which had not onli fail to condemn pkk terror but gave the impress that it actual support it the same argument cannot have ani ground where elci and burkai ar concern to be more clear there could be a chanc for a fresh start despit all of the pain which ha been wit and despit the pkk own threat to ani movement it cannot control the question is whether turkei can be made to toler thi fresh start for it own benefit at the cost of amend it constitut and law it appear to me that such a chanc exist and that turkei s alli will be plai a vital role on what happen in the futur no on should be expect to accept a countri claim to be democrat continu to judg and punish opinion as no on should expect human right violat of ani sort commit by either side of the conflict to be forgotten onli thi wai can turkei truli argu against what will be portrai as the legitimaci of illeg thu action must be taken immedi action must be taken to insur the safeti of new politician who will appear on the scene of legal activ both against the pkk and their persecutor action also ha to be taken to voic concern on the freedom of express in turkei there appear to be no ground whatsoev to the argument that thi issu is onli turkei s domest in hous affair for through the effort of certain individu who current exploit power in the absenc of a strong civilian regim the affair ha been turn into an intern on with veri seriou humanitarian interest also unfortun for those behind the intoler campaign we now wit turkei ha sign intern accord and is oblig to meet certain intern criteria if we cannot meet these term regul mainli by the intern declar of human right pari charter and the helsinki final act and if
