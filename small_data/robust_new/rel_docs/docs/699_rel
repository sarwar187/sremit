without it lester thurow dean of the sloan school of manag at massachusett institut of technolog under gramm rudman holl as pass we re alreadi suppos to have balanc the budget and in fact the budget deficit in 1992 even with a budget packag is go to be bigger than it wa in 1991 it s like cano veri rapidli up a river that s run veri fast so that you re actual go backward even though you re paddl like crazi i think the event that make the budget negoti more seriou thi time is that the german and japanes have basic been fund the deficit and the german have notifi the world that thei re not go to be lend monei to the rest of the world thei re go to be borrow monei and put their monei plu the borrow monei into east germani becaus of the event in the tokyo stock market as well as the interest

limit statewid elect offici to two consecut four year term state legisl to 12 consecut year in offic proposit 140 would hold assembl member to six year in offic state senat and statewid elect offici

legisl and legisl specialist richard l mountjoi member of the state assembl r monrovia first elect in 1978 a former gener contractor who ha serv as mayor and citi councilman of monrovia 1968 76 by 1996 there would be all new face the argument that the lobbyist would take advantag of them i believ is not valid term limit would give the peopl of california more control over the legislatur and the legislatur would be less prone to special interest becaus legisl would know thei ar go to be there for six year and thei re out term limit would stop polit from be a profession occup for mani member that s all thei ve ever done be in the legislatur legisl staff i think it will return the legislatur to more of a citizen type legisl the legislatur right now is control by those peopl who have a vest interest in legisl i came to the legislatur after eight year on the monrovia citi council i knew the system there pretti well i knew how to get thing done i think that the legisl committe hear ar noth more than citi council meet on differ subject matter i think that what would happen in the legislatur is more expertis come out of the citizenri i think there would be peopl from all walk of life i think the ag bracket would creep up a littl more get peopl who have been in busi folk who want to do it as a public servic at least it would not be domin by profession robert preslei state senat d riversid sinc 1974 formerli a member of the riversid counti sheriff s depart for 24 year 12 of them as undersheriff my guess is that in about 20 year there would be anoth initi to chang term limit becaus we will have found that thei didn t work the lobbyist ar there for a veri long time and thei becom veri expert in their field and will be even more influenti more power thei ar not realli account to anyon except their employ it would becom clear rather quickli that you have a bunch of elect amateur try to run a veri complex complic system of state govern we ar not a littl backwat state anymor we have a popul of about 30 million peopl we ar grow at the rate of three quarter of a million peopl a year and that alon is hard for peopl to comprehend it is not just the number it is the ethnic mix the cultur divers all of those thing have to be crank in so govern the state of california is not as easi and simpl as a lot of peopl would think and the other thing a lot of peopl seem to think is that you the governor or you the legisl can get up there and solv these problem tomorrow well there ar some of them that ar almost not solvabl you have to keep try karl t kurtz director of state servic nation confer of state legislatur the most neg and pernici impact of term limit will be on the leadership of the legislatur thei need leader who have a great deal of experi skill and abil to lead and to get thing done so that thei avoid the kind of stalem we have had in congress in recent year but legislatur also need strong committe chairmen and term limit mean that rel inexperienc peopl ar go to be in leadership and that thei ar by definit lame duck from the veri begin that is probabl the most neg impact there ha been a nation movement that start in california 25 year ago to realli strengthen the role of legislatur and to make them co equal branch of govern thing like term limit which would restrict the power and author of legislatur ar a step backward in that movement it would mean that in rel term the legislatur would cede more power and author to the execut branch to lobbyist and to legisl staff mark p petracca assist professor of polit and societi uc irvin the nation effect would be veri impress becaus unlik oklahoma where voter recent approv a 12 year limit on legisl which doe not have a reput for be in the vanguard of polit chang in america california doe becaus it is the largest polit state in the countri a success for either proposit here is like to have spinoff move around the countri sinc state do have the power to amend the constitut on their own although it is much harder to do it that wai it could veri well be that the groundswel of support for thi movement in some kei industri state would lead to not onli initi in those state to restrict their own state legisl term but also a demand for a constitut amend to do the same as to what ar the implic of term limit in the state of california a lot of peopl think that thi is a partisan issu i have tri to make the argument that it is not realli partisan at all the parti could be help by thi peopl would have to becom more depend on the parti for fund and for guidanc and less depend on the special interest the big problem is that nation or local we do not have a cultur that encourag and reward public servic for short period of time democraci requir that and yet we do not have it that is why we creat what in effect is a profession elit to govern us represent doe not occur well then antonia hernandez presid of the mexican american legal defens fund the schabarum initi proposit 140 back by lo angel counti supervisor pete schabarum with a six year limit for assembl member would have an advers effect on the latino commun we have begun to look at whether it would violat the vote right act run for elect is a veri expens proposit for minor who do not have a financi base it is usual extrem hard to rais the monei well financ well organ candid who ar support by other commun will have a much better chanc it seem that as we latino begin to make entri into the polit process the rule ar begin to chang elect offici ar suppos to repres the peopl who elect them if there ar constant chang the impact of term limit would be to empow the bureaucraci the peopl who ar not elect and thei would definit empow the special interest who have the financ and the abil to assist the bureaucrat be an elect offici take experi the first two year you ar just find your wai around the second two you ar just hit your stride and in the third two year you ar on your wai out if 40 pass it just doesn t make sens there ar a lot of problem with our polit process but thi is not the solut there is some merit to term limit but thei have to be done in a wai that doesn t unduli strengthen the bureaucraci and other who ar not elect we should throw the rotten appl out but not the whole system with it gari c jacobson fellow center for advanc studi in the behavior scienc stanford univers professor of polit scienc uc san diego the standard argument is that the legisl branch would be weaken inform will be held by bureaucrat staff special interest i think that is true but what we ar overlook ar the pervers incent we set up instead of worri about what their constitu think as it get toward the end of their term legisl ar go to be worri about what their next employ think possibl in the privat sector or in their next constitu which will not necessarili share the same interest as the on that elect them so what it will do is revers the incent if you give someon a job for instanc and tell them that no
