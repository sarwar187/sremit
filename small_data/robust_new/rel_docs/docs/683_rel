FBIS3-20764: languag slovak articl type cso commentari by stefan patrik kovac czech specter haunt slovak armi text in thi articl i would like to offer reader an insid look at the so call czech problem in the slovak armi by someon who is directli involv i would like to share with the reader my observ from within the barrack wall i believ that the barrack where i report for militari servic in octob 1993 follow my colleg graduat ar not basic differ from other barrack in slovakia and that i can in good conscienc consid them to be a true pictur of barrack in the entir slovak republ with some smaller or bigger differ and i therefor think that my observ can be in a certain sens gener but to start at the begin alreadi upon hear the first word of the welcom speech by the command of the school for reserv offic which by the wai consist of onli on train battalion in the whole barrack i wa veri surpris becaus i thought that the command must have made a mistak that hi wa a slip of the tongu for he introduc the barrack as the barrack of the xth czechoslovak brigad i am not mention the exact number for understand reason but i wa shock a few dai later when i wa abl to leav the barrack and see on the outsid the actual offici name which although rather inconspicu wa nevertheless clearli and unambigu mark on the namepl by the gate and so to my unpleas surpris i found that thei realli ar name barrack of the xth czechoslovak brigad and thi in the ninth month of the exist of the independ slovak republ and these barrack still bear that name i found that absolut unbeliev but insid the barrack wall mani more surpris await me as far as the offic instructor and the entir offic corp of the barrack ar concern i dare sai that czech or czech speak offic sinc quit a few consid themselv moravian make up a good fifth of them mani of them i do not claim that all i also met on or two decent czech behav in a veri arrog manner their behavior doe not indic ani gratitud toward the slovak republ and the slovak armi for keep them in it rank by which it show the highest degre of toler on the contrari thei often behav in a superior and haughti manner as if thei own the world we have here for exampl the case of a lower rank czech offic who find it difficult to announc himself with the slovak tu here and alwai us downright provoc the czech zde although it would not realli give him too much troubl to learn thi simpl slovak word mani other do the same thing can it be that thei do not think the slovak languag is equal to the czech languag that thei consid slovak to be someth inferior i know onli on czech in the entir barrack who make an effort to speak in slovak and he claim to be a moravian or a slovak born in moravia other stubbornli cling to czech thei conduct lesson in czech dictat note in czech give command in czech i am not even mention the problem thi caus at the same time we know that a slovak offic in the czech republ soon talk in czech there in the almost chauvinist czech environ he would not get veri far with hi slovak from variou indic and frequent comment i know that these czech who serv in the slovak armi greatli miss the former feder although of cours thei do not speak out openli against the slovak republ and i never actual heard them sai anyth against the slovak republ and in favor of the csfr thei ar certainli veri well awar that it would cost them their job but if push come to shove who know who could sai with certainti what their reaction would be or who could guarante which side thei would join as far as print materi is concern you will not find ani in slovak practic all of the print matter i came across from the draft order to the militari ident card to instruct on us and oper militari equip is in czech and thi a year after the independ slovak state came into exist graphic diagram instruct descript of weapon and technolog on poster and chart apart from a few slovak on which thei made here as a do it yourself amateur project everyth in czech everyth in czech and even those makeshift chart and poster with instruct ar written as i and my friend who is a slovak languag expert agre in unbeliev bad slovak it is mere a kind of liter translat from czech with czechism or actual czech word with slovak end and i am not even mention the grammat error everyon for whom the slovak languag is more than just a mean of commun and mayb even to them must throw up their hand over such a creation a downright defil of our nativ languag but that is not all even instruct video and other film on us weapon or repair militari equip all ar czech and in czech not a singl on with a text narrat in slovak exist but that then caus big problem for instanc in translat veri special militari term from czech into slovak mani instructor capitul when search for a slovak equival after all we all know what it mean or it happen to be simpler and more comfort and merrili go on us the czech term inde even now after a year of the independ slovak republ we can form a good pictur of the condit that exist in the armi dure csfr and cssr in fact even dure the pre munich csr befor 1 januari 1992 the armi wa on of the effici instrument for the czechiz of the slovak a veri good and graphic even though sad exampl is present by the slovak offic themselv in the militari garrison there ar practic no offic who do not us in their oral instruct czechism or actual czech express on even give hi command in czech could it be that thei seem more forc to him and in fact all of them have some smaller some bigger problem with the slovak languag there ar even enough of those whose slovak is downright catastroph in thi respect no wonder after all mani of them studi in militari colleg in the czech land thei were taught by czech professor in slovakia or thei learn from czech textbook until 1 januari 1993 slovak us to go the czech land and czech in lesser number to slovakia but those who adapt were alwai the slovak anoth shock and a great surpris await me when i visit our militari librari what can you expect everyth wa in czech the entir index and catalogu of book in the librari which on would expect to have been made by a slovak in slovakia doe thi not appli even here in czech and to thi dai slogan and quotat from famou peopl ar written in czech on wall poster doe nobodi mind the librari natur also ha shelv mark with the letter r accent with the diacrit hacek which exist in the czech languag but not in slovak someth i never saw not dure the time of the feder or cssr anywher in slovakia in civilian librari anoth matter of cours is the great number of czech book is there an analog situat in czech librari permit me to express great doubt about that it even appear i did not count them exactli that here in slovakia there ar more czech book than slovak on and we have book begin with fiction all the wai to scientif subject of all kind when it came to cultur and the written word the czech gave it particularli care attent even a librari wa a veri us instrument for the czechiz of the slovak environ the interior decor in the barrack and the recreat room on the wall hang photograph of the countrysid castl chateaux which on do you think predomin slovak wrong again onli czech on czech castl czech countrysid if czech why then not german british french don t we have enough interest slovak subject that is also anoth vestig of the legaci of the common but in fact onli czech armi befor i conclud my articl i will mention on more exampl to make it clear to the reader how the czech act dure the divis of the feder armi when it wa alreadi obviou to everyon that the slovak would establish their second independ state on 1 januari 1993 thi wa told to us with a touch of bitter in hi voic by a lieuten colonel befor come to teach at the school for reserv offic he work in a certain slovak town in a modern tank train facil for train tank driver and other some of the staff and the servic and repair personnel were czech after the divis of the feder these peopl liter fled to the czech republ and stole all of the manual natur it wa as if thei had vanish into thin air and there wa no wai to find out where thei were thei simpli disappear thei were gone and with them all of the complic detail manual that ar so essenti for make repair as well as for other purpos our czech brother vividli demonstr their idea of brotherhood slovak offic and the servic personnel then had to work night dismantl and draw up new wire diagram and gradual put togeth a makeshift manual without ani help everyth wa made much more difficult and complic especi locat defect and make repair in spite of that thei manag to somehow keep the trainer in oper it wa an unheard of and brazen dirti trick by the czech someth that is not done among civil and decent peopl what to do then we must liter have a program for a plan de czechiz of the slovak armi of cours it is complic as far as the czech offic ar concern thei have slovak wive children apart on the other hand mani slovak offic ar wait in the czech republ becaus there is no hous for them in slovakia howev thei could to begin with learn at least a few express command in slovak mani even know them but it is probabl beneath their digniti to us the slovak languag we must begin it should have been done a long time ago a year ago with small step also thing like a czech catalogu czech rule for borrow book and czech slogan on librari wall a year after the slovak republ came into exist those should not be seen ani more czech train film will probabl be shown for a long time to come there is no monei for make new on in slovak but mayb thei could be dub in slovak we must gradual begin it should have been done a long time ago chang not onli the czech wall mount instruct chart and poster but also those written in czech slovak should at least on slovak languag expert be emploi in each of the barrack he would certainli have hi hand full becaus thi wai with czech profession soldier and offic instructor the czechiz of the

titl civil militari relat in a democraci in the nation assembl of slovenia first i must excus my clumsi titl origin i wrote the european of the balkan which seem on the face of it easier to understand but as i reflect on the problem a littl more it occur to me that thi polit question affect not just the balkan but the entir post soviet complex of countri and territori some european some asian and some ly somewher in between mani writer these dai us express such as central and eastern europ or central eastern and southeastern europ but it seem to me that these express ar actual dishonest thei ar us to suggest that a place call eastern europ doe exist somewher or other but that the particular countri or countri be discuss ar not necessarili part of it the onli thing that realli unit all the countri we might want to talk about is that thei ar not not so far anywai in western europ for that reason then i have decid to adopt the term suggest by michel bertelli not western europ the difficulti of locat eastern europ on a map these dai doe ani countri now identifi itself as east european lead me to suspect that europ itself is mere the figment of our polit imagin but western europ anywai doe seem to have a real mean even if the west european ident too is vagu in place so i hope thi is enough to explain my titl what i want to analyz is the spread of the polit cultur of western europ to countri formerli under soviet marxist leninist titoist hoxhaist and other so call socialist regim as a resid of the czech republ and a visitor to slovenia i am struck by the fact that these two countri both now look like veri good candid for integr into western europ at an earli date thi natur lead to self satisfi self congratul from the popul and also mayb some envi from neighbor state but apart from these emot reaction and i would sai that most of the polit rhetor we hear about peac secur democraci and so on is in realiti mere emot perhap we can suggest some object reason why thi might be the case and thi will then help us to understand some larger issu there ar i think three factor that link the czech republ and slovenia the first is the preserv of the broadli liber intellectu habit of the profession peopl in societi the second is a more or less homogen popul in term of nation self identif anywai and the third is the exist of appropri border isol that popul from neighbor group first the intellectu cultur it should be obviou to anyon with the smallest knowledg of not western europ that onli a few peopl had ani seriou involv in it polit structur while mani peopl felt compel to us parti jargon and mayb attend some polit social and sport event most peopl simpli tri to get on with their live and pursu privat interest for educ profession peopl these interest were read write plai chess or a music instrument visit the theater the ballet or the opera the kind of intellectu interest in fact that sadli have decai in the west now these peopl who ar mostli still just try to get on with their live and struggl to make sens of the chao of transit repres a reservoir of civil valu that is crucial for the process of cultur and polit regener we can call democrat without name name countri that abandon these valu and instead of preserv some version of thi intellectu cultur seek to set up some more fanat extremist set of valu ar not like to be accept into western europ so thi is on factor the second and third factor ar relat to the idea of the nation state countri hope to join western europ will have to resembl west european countri first and to do that thei need to fulfil two condit have a homogen popul and be isol in their own territori thi is a polit cultur demand made by the west european countri which ar appar not abl or will to deal with other countri on ani other basi franc is the territori where the french peopl live portug is the land of the portugues and western europ as a whole with a common polit cultur origin in the successor state of the disintegr western roman empir is now search blindli for it own reflect in the turbul water of the veri larg and veri chaotic polit cultur complex on it eastern border accord to these criteria the czech republ and slovenia come out pretti near the top of the list though of cours we can add some remark and qualif czech bourgeoi intellectu valu look as solid as ever the czech toler some polit extrem certainli but thi is a sign of polit matur and not of failur or incompet there is a characterist style of skeptic intellectu which whatev other defect it might have is unlik to provid a basi for ideolog of hatr and fanatic the territori question is close bound up with the divorc with slovakia thi wa accept in the end as a sad necess though it disrupt life for mani peopl it wa most difficult for those caught on the other side but now that the situat is more or less stabl we can sai that the slovak now live in the czech republ ar live as czech either as actual czech citizen or at least as perman member of the czech popul sinc thei share a common recent histori and czechoslovak polit cultur thi mean that the criterion of homogen is more or less fulfil ad the qualif that the smaller popul of romani german pole and other ar not numer or well organ enough to have a materi effect on polit life the same thing cannot be said for slovakia where there is a larg and polit activ hungarian popul the divis of czechoslovakia ha creat an imbal as far as my two criteria ar concern and so we see that the czech republ is closer to integr for these object reason than the slovak republ the mismatch between border and popul mean that slovakia will have to solv it problem with hungari befor it can look like an accept nation state as far as the west is concern hungari is lock in a similar situat with romania and other countri mesh into thi not western europ type of cross border polit will find it significantli more difficult to reorient themselv to the polit cultur valu of the west slovenia is also in a proto nation state condit but for veri differ reason have escap the yugoslav war by a whisker the sloven now find themselv in a state of their own there ar no

everydai polit is calm and profession definit not the case in some other former yugoslav republ on could mention to take the argument a littl further let s look at kazakhstan the onli post soviet state in which the titular popul the kazakh is actual a minor the approxim figur ar 40 percent kazakh 38 percent russian and 22 percent other includ 5 percent german and bizarr a small minor of czech although the border of thi veri larg countri 2 7 million squar kilomet mai roughli correspond to the boundari of the territori over which the origin nomad kazakh tribe onc roam the territori is not at all homogen sinc in mani area russian and kazakh live separ if parallel cultur live kazakhstan is veri far from be a nation state and if we put kazakhstan at the far end of the spectrum of integr we can at last compar the prospect of the variou candid for west european accord to object criteria estonia sai despit it veri civil popul must be place closer to the kazakh end of the spectrum it territori is at present also home to a larg popul of russian most of whom ar certainli not live as estonian but still enjoi the vodka and miseri lifestyl of the dear old ussr if we want to find anoth countri to put somewher near the top of the list poland look like a good bet it popul is pretti much homogen but it doesn t quit fulfil the border requir sinc a signific number of pole resid in neighbor countri thi problem is most seriou in lithuania but while thi make polish lithuanian relat a bit sticki it doe not actual creat ani seriou intern difficulti for poland by the same logic we could put hungari and albania on the list but significantli lower down becaus of the difficulti experienc by hungarian and albanian live in other state reader will be abl to fill in the name of whatev other state thei mai be interest in what ar the consequ of thi analysi for practic polici let s take a look at two other countri with extrem seriou and difficult problem the russian feder and the rump yugoslavia serbia and montenegro it is quit clear that these tow countri at present fail to fulfil our three criteria and by wide margin in the case of russia though i think we must still be patient sinc it is still in a phase of transit and the wide swing in russia s intern polit illustr the instabl of it gener situat the popul and border bear littl relationship to on anoth and due to the enorm expans of the variou incarn of the russian state there ar mani enclav of other popul still live on their ancient homeland within what we tend to think of as russia add to thi mix the effect of the larg popul movement of the soviet period and the result if a russian speak feder that is actual polycultur and polyn i would like to draw on import conclus from thi in connect with the rump yugoslavia in the ussr there wa an attempt to creat a synthet homo sovieticu soviet nation marshal tito made a similar effort with the so call yugoslav when the yugoslav feder began to break up under complex and tragic circumst the west in a polit reflex action tri to find a yugoslav nation state to bargain with thi had the immedi effect of give intern legitimaci to the faction in the yugoslav peopl s armi and elsewher who were soon to bring the phrase ethnic cleans to the ear of a horrifi world it would be too much to suggest that the west is respons for the war of the former yugoslavia but the blind polici of seek west european type nation state where none exist befor ha definit contribut to the tragedi what is the altern it is to deal with state and popul as thei actual ar and not as we might like them to be in some european fantasi world the fact that kazakhstan for exampl doe not have the popul structur of a west european nation state doe not mean it should automat and perman be exclud from the polit cultur and econom life of the intern commun what right do we have to penal state just becaus thei ar cultur pluralist we should develop a polit cultur sophist enough to deal with the object complex of the problem concern and lest anyon think thi is just a theoret or abstract problem let me leav you with thi thought the polit and cultur structur of yugoslavia had mani thing in common with that of the ussr to the point that mani analyst speak of yugoslavia as the ussr in miniatur apart from differ of scale though there is also the differ that the former ussr still ha a
