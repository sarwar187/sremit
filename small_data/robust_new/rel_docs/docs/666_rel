on that flier the tori when thei ditch mr thatcher mai possibl have been do the right thing by their parti and for it fortun in britain but thei were throw awai a great asset in intern relat especi relat with america and britain acquir in place of that asset a liabil if britain repudi that marvel margaret thatcher well there must be someth wrong with britain mustn t there as for mr major hi name and imag carri hardli ani connot here but for those who do know someth about him the connot ar neg consist mainli of a vagu impress that he is the gui who stab mr thatcher in the back the deterior

franco american leadership especi over bosnia britain is present as drag it feet over bosnia i believ britain wa right to oppos the drift toward militari intervent but for the present it is the french who ar give a lead in the direct favour by popular opinion in america then there is the small but reveal episod of gerri adam and hi visa first of all mr adam would not have been grant an american visa while mr thatcher wa prime minist mr thatcher inspir fear both in washington and in dublin mr major inspir noth in particular in either capit sinc the down street declar of 15 decemb with it fatal concess of the hume adam word on self determin albert reynold ha been under the impress that he can get awai with pretti well anyth where the present british govern is concern even get an american visa for the polit head of the provision ira while the ira arm struggl against britain continu the grant of that visa wa on symptom of a gener deterior in anglo american relat but the consequ of grant the visa have acceler the deterior thi wa not mainli a result of gerri adam anti british tirad on larri king live and elsewher these reach huge audienc but embarrass hi more respect sponsor who had bought the line that mr adam is now an earnest seeker after peac there wa consequ a certain revuls against him in influenti quarter but then mr major s govern by the form of it protest compound the damag alreadi done it is in gener inadvis for a govern to protest publicli against someth it ha been unabl to stop thi onli advertis the inabl in question and thi wa all the wors becaus the inabl wa the result not of harsh fate but of sheer incompet mr major could have nip that visa in the bud he should have known what albert reynold wa up to and made him stop he should have call on mr reynold to oppos as all previou irish govern have done the grant of a visa to the presid of sinn fein he should have warn mr reynold that if he fail to do so he would be place the futur of the anglo irish agreement in danger had mr major done that mr reynold would have advis senat daniel patrick moynihan and edward kennedi to withhold support from thi year s visa applic as from previou on and the visa would not have been grant have fail to prevent what he could quietli have prevent mr major then protest at the top of hi voic sever decibel too loud to be of help to anglo american relat in their present frail condit to send a formal protest to the british ambassador in washington would have been enough to carpet the american ambassador in london wa far too flamboy it inevit evok the anti british compon alwai latent american nation the new york time is rather less nationalist than most american and is gener not anti british yet it comment on the carpet of the america ambassador wa the nastiest i have seen in a respect american newspap in relat to an alli of the unit state the editori appear saturdai under the headlin the lion whine about mr adam the head faithfulli reflect the hostil and contemptu tone of the whole editori the argument wa on first amend line as if thi wa a british attempt to impos censorship on the unit state instead of a protest against the grant of a visa to a known enemi of britain and a spokesman for terror but the tone of the editori wa unmistak that of arous american nation on an anti british bing intellectu the editori is contempt but as a symptom of danger forc at work in unexpect place it must be taken serious in gener there mai not be a lot mr major can do about improv anglo american relat but there is on not insignific area in which he can do someth he can warn dublin belatedli but still effect that if it again lend itself to make troubl for britain in the us it will undermin the anglo irish agreement through activ incompat with the spirit of that agreement mr reynold would take such a warn serious for the rest mr major should reflect that he ha now to mend hi fenc with a us administr which hi govern foolishli strove to prevent from ever come into be he ha a lot to live down presid clinton s hero is john f kennedi whose motto wa forgiv your enemi but rememb their name
