LA100790-0050: the budget debacl time is run out for an america lack an econom plan wa the budget compromis worth save georg bush s bulli pulpit didn t work when he tri to convinc the nation in a televis address tuesdai night that it wa all for the best no on ever suppos that bush had the charisma of ronald reagan or hi predecessor s capac for us oratori to swai public opinion but perhap there were other reason why congress found it so easi to resist bush s plea and hi arm twist the plan gave too much to the rich and the militari without solv the underli problem of the us economi if the altern to thi flaw agreement is no deficit reduct agreement at all isn t it worth do accord to alan greenspan chairman of the feder reserv board the plan would have brought down interest rate and promot econom growth so we all benefit in the end even if todai s sacrific mai not be as equit as thei might be administr economist agre the problem with thi logic is that it s built on quicksand the econom project underli the plan assum that oil price would fall that america would stai out of a recess that the cost of the save and loan bailout won t escal and that the world won t be experienc a credit crunch all these assumpt ar dubiou to sai the least thei run counter to everi observ trend if oil price continu their upward climb and if japan and germani continu to us up their spare cash interest rate will stai high and go higher regardless of the budget accord we re in a world economi now if you hadn t notic us interest rate don t depend sole on how much monei is left over after the us govern and us consum and corpor stop spend us interest rate depend on how much is left over after govern consum and compani all over the world stop spend cut america s budget deficit by 34 billion what the compromis sought for next year is like take a bucket of sea water out of the pacif it doesn t have much effect on the tide meanwhil the us economi is like to continu it downward slide so even the 34 billion cut is optimist welfar and unemploy insur cost ar like to rise precipit the feder govern will have to bail out some big bank and insur compani as well as more s ls and tax receipt will shrink my best guess is that the deficit cut agreement would have end up reduc next year s budget deficit by 24 billion hardli a figur to write home about the ironi is that cut govern spend and rais tax right now by even thi rel small amount is the wrong tonic for a weaken economi consum and corpor ar alreadi hold back as high oil price and their own massiv borrow scare them awai from the market it s the lesson that john maynard keyn should have taught us a half centuri ago unless govern pick up the slack we could face an even deeper and longer recess but what about the budget deficit isn t it a big problem ye but we should have got seriou about reduc it three year ago when the economi wa ride high mayb we can safe rais tax and cut spend a few year from now when world interest rate and oil price have come back down to earth and the us economi is more buoyant but not now in fact cut the budget deficit is so import over the long term that it might even be worth reward the wealthi and the denizen of the pentagon with huge windfal if that s the price of get an agreement but it s not worth that price right now when all we get in return is a sluggish economi and a pail of seawat the
