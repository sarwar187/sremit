vladimir pasechnik wa born in 1937 in stalingrad a citi soon to be ravag by the second world war he becam on of the brightest young scientist in the soviet union determin to us hi talent in the caus of peac never allow hi research in biophys to plai ani part in the kind of destruct that had cost the live of hi famili after graduat he did research at the institut of high molecular compound in leningrad work on new antibiot and treatment for supposedli incur ill such as cancer in 1974 he wa approach by a gener from the soviet ministri of defenc with an irresist offer to set up and run a laboratori in leningrad with an unlimit budget to bui equip in the west and recruit the best staff from all over the soviet union it would be known as the institut of ultra pure biochem prepar for pasechnik it wa an opportun to realis mani of hi most cherish ambit in the fight against ill hi earli research wa promis he felt he could produc a cure to some form of cancer until then he had thought he would never have the resourc to complet hi work now he wa be given the chanc to develop on of the soviet union s most advanc laboratori in biotechnolog he accept the fact that the offer came from the ministri of defenc did not worri him unduli in the soviet union the militari wa the engin of most scientif research it had the cash and the peopl to run it even if a scientif project had a strictli civilian applic the militari wa still in charg it wa the soviet wai from 1974 to 1981 pasechnik built up hi special laboratori scour the countri until he had 400 peopl on hi staff a lavish budget and enough hard currenc to give hi scientist constant access to the latest biotechnolog advanc in the west the laboratori began it work in 1981 over the next two year pasechnik realis the truth far from be the heart of a new civilian research oper he wa at the centr of a vast network of factori and laboratori work on deadli new weapon of war offici we were involv in vaccin develop and in produc prepar for protect crop said pasechnik in fact we were develop method of product and equip for a huge biolog warfar programm to begin with pasechnik had littl idea of the scale of the oper onli later did he discov that as well as hi laboratori in leningrad there were two more in moscow two just outsid it and on in novosibirsk all work on the same project five manufactur plant emploi 15 000 peopl were oper in other part of the countri the oper known as biopreparat had a budget of 200m roubl and ten of million of american dollar a year it wa on of the best kept secret of the cold war it task wa to develop new strain of diseas more power than anyth known to scienc and to produc them in aerosol form the germ also had to be resist to antibiot avail to the nato armi of the west the specif job alloc to pasechnik s laboratori staff wa to make them effect weapon of war thei had to find wai of deliv the germ by artilleri shell bomb or missil to ensur that thei had a long life in the open air and that thei could be dispers over a wide area the breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institut of appli microbiolog at obolensk 60 mile south of moscow there with the help of work done at pasechnik s laboratori scientist develop their first super plagu a new strain of tularaemia a sever infecti bacteri diseas of man and domest anim carri by contact or insect bite it is name after tular california where it wa discov the test on it were suffici encourag for moscow to give permiss for full scale develop and product two year later the scientist at obolensk were ask to develop an even more deadli germ base on pneumon plagu anoth airborn infect pasechnik s job wa to refin the product process to make the oper more effici as a result by 1987 the soviet union had suffici industri capac to manufactur 200 kilo of the super plagu everi week enough to kill up to 500 000 peopl the super plagu germ wa of cours never manufactur on thi scale the germ had a short life and onli enough wa made for test but the biopreparat network stood on standbi readi to begin fullscal product when instruct at a time in the futur that wa design dai x here then wa a programm for

everi part of thi programm wa in breach of the 1972 biolog and toxin warfar convent an intern agreement which the soviet union had sign it wa also against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been proclaim by mikhail gorbachev for pasechnik the gorbachev era wa a chanc to try to chang the direct of the programm at hi laboratori in late 1985 he pressur senior offici in biopreparat to let him switch some of hi research effort to the civilian purpos for which it had ostens been establish he got nowher i wa told mani time just to get on with my work and stai in my place he said pasechnik did just that by 1988 he had risen to a rank equival to that of major gener and wa in charg of two manufactur plant and three research laboratori two of these were work on biolog weapon the third wa given to him to placat hi desir to do civil work and also as a cover for the biolog warfar research but pasechnik wa increasingli uneasi he had no idea that hi work wa in breach of the 1972 treati he did not know such a treati exist but he felt that the weapon he wa help to develop were an abus of hi scientif skill and demonstr hypocrisi in the russian militari command about the gorbachev revolut abov all he felt passion that genet engin biolog weapon were a crime against human in late 1988 he began to think about defect despit hi long and illustri scientif career pasechnik had never been allow to travel outsid the soviet bloc then in the summer of 1989 biopreparat began negoti with a factori in toulous franc which manufactur equip for chemic laboratori pasechnik volunt

of anthrax had kill up to a hundr peopl an area three mile downwind of the factori had been contamin the russian had tri to contain the damag with a widespread immunis programm but it had prove larg useless throughout the 1980s the leak had been rais by both british and american offici with their soviet counterpart but the offici line remain the same that a hand of peopl had di in the citi after eat contamin meat bought on the black market there wa no biolog weapon programm snippet of inform from sourc in the soviet union suggest otherwis satellit pictur show plant and test site appar configur for the manufactur of biolog weapon the dia the defenc intellig agenc the pentagon s spi estim that the russian had up to eight site for develop and store biolog weapon si larg concur with that view and a seri of report were circul to intellig chief and british minist warn that the soviet biolog programm had not slow down as a result of the gorbachev reform as frequent happen when intellig is fragmentari the politician refus to hear the messag at the time all western govern had been seduc by gorbachev s reform the cold war wa thaw and no prime minist or presid wa prepar to risk a confront with the soviet union that might chang the delic balanc of intern relat at the same time there wa a sens that gorbachev wa an honour man who would not allow anyth as terribl as biolog weapon to be develop while he wa presid the intellig warn were ignor when the si station chief in pari flash the messag to london about the would be defector in toulous it caus consider excit at last here wa proof that would satisfi even the most sceptic politician pasechnik wa driven to pari and caught a british airwai flight to heathrow travel on fals paper suppli by british intellig as hi feet

that he would probabl face seriou charg and perhap prison in the west it is a measur of hi courag that despit hi fear he step off the plane readi to tell all as soon as he wa settl in a safe hous outsid london he wa reassur that he had found a new home and not a prison cell there wa the normal nervous in si about ani defector wa he a plant all the indic were that he wa bona fide he did not know how to drive a clear sign that he wa a member of the privileg elit in the soviet union the distress he show when he recount the work he wa do wa imposs to fake then there wa hi love of mozart

whole ministri expos billion of roubl spent a complet organis shown to be a front then there wa the clear involv of gorbachev thi friend of the west it just went on and on to cope with all the inform pasechnik produc si the ministri of defenc and other govern depart set up a special task forc of scientist intellig offic and analyst to assess the intellig and put it into a wider context it wa painstak work but veri fruit as he describ hi entir life educ and work the taskforc understood for the first time the real relationship between the academi of scienc previous consid a pure civilian bodi and the soviet militari as is usual in such case the intellig glean from pasechnik wa share with the cia on both side of the atlant the mosaic of russia s biolog weapon programm wa gradual fill in as the pictur clear so both the cia and si began to brief their respect polit master for the first time the politician were given unambigu report clearli prepar on the basi of inform from a highli place defector to underlin the serious of the problem pasechnik wa brought out to brief senior offici on both side of the atlant the evid wa so compel that even the politician who had no wish to confront gorbachev were left with no choic in april 1990 the british and american govern jointli confront the soviet union with the evid and spell out in detail what thei knew there wa no reaction then in june 1990 presid georg bush and margaret thatcher met separ with gorbachev both rais the question of biolog weapon gorbachev deni all knowledg thatcher who believ she had a special close relationship with the soviet leader told him that unless the programm wa stop the west would go public gorbachev promis that he would look into the matter two month later the soviet foreign minist eduard shevardnadz sent a formal repli rebut the charg by thi time both the cia and si had produc an even more exhaust brief for bush and thatcher have succeed in forc action at the highest level after so mani year of frustrat the intellig commun wa determin to press it case until the russian confess in decemb 1990 the russian issu an invit to washington and london to visit four of the site that had been name a joint anglo american deleg wa dispatch if the trip wa intend to be reassur it had the opposit effect in obolensk the british discov a chamber for test biolog weapon suspend in an

russian continu their denial in septemb 1991 a month after the attempt coup john major the new british prime minist met gorbachev in the kremlin publicli the two hour meet wa confin to econom issu but major confront him with the evid of the secret weapon programm again gorbachev deni everyth and move the normal unflapp major to wave an angri finger in the face of the russian leader we ve got the good on you he shout as the intellig commun continu ad to the file the confront with moscow continu through the fall of gorbachev and the rise to power of bori yeltsin on februari 1 1992 bush and yeltsin met for their first summit in advanc of the meet at camp david american diplomat made clear that the biolog weapon programm wa a major stumbl block between the two alli and a gestur by yeltsin in thi area would be seen as a sign of a new era in us russian relat thi time yeltsin came prepar he admit for the first time that there had inde been a secret programm and that he had order it to be shut down but it wa not for anoth month that yeltsin wa told by hi own offici of the full extent of the programm in march the russian militari final came clean thei had secretli develop bomb and missil capabl of carri the super plagu in defianc of intern agreement yeltsin sign a formal decre cancel the programm but the disinform did not stop there as promin russian offici involv in the biopreparat programm set about try to minimis the work thei had been involv in it wa a campaign fill with the kind of li and evas that were suppos to have vanish in the new era of democraci in russia for exampl gener valentin yevstigneyev assur the newspap nezavisimaya gazeta there were not as mani peopl involv as it might seem he maintain that the work of the variou laboratori wa essenti for civilian purpos he also tri to diminish the role of pasechnik reaction like these contribut to grow sceptic in both london and washington that yeltsin s order to dismantl the biopreparat project wa be carri out although the main test site wa report to have been shut down those monitor the project were hardli reassur when it wa announc that the man put in charg of the dismantl of biopreparat would be gener anatolii kuntsevich the architect of the soviet union s chemic weapon programm hi appoint wa seen as a sop to the hardlin in the militari on senior western intellig offici said here wa thi man who had done noth but lie to us for year on chemic weapon and now suddenli we ar suppos to accept that he is willingli go to set about destroi hi life s work we could hardli be expect to take yeltsin s promis at face valu in juli 1992 the british and american govern demand from the russian a list of all their biolog weapon research product and storag site and access to them two month later russia agre to allow a full inspect but fail to admit the exist of all of their site there the matter stand sinc then verif ha prove almost imposs to reinforc western concern the cia brought out a defector from the biopreparat programm in late 1992 he confirm pasechnik s stori and ad to western suspicion that while yeltsin wa claim the programm had stop the research and develop of new strain of genet engin superweapon were continu apac when presid bill clinton and yeltsin met in vancouv less than a year ago biolog warfar wa on the agenda onc again yeltsin assur the american presid that all work had stop thi time yeltsin wa so convinc that even some of the most cynic in the intellig commun were inclin to believ him then last autumn anoth defector from the biopreparat project came over to british intellig to tell hi debrief what step the russian militari had taken to keep the project go in everi facil that had been open for inspect to western intellig the russian had establish convinc cover stori that made it appear as if each site had been convert to research or manufactur of vaccin the secret work continu in part of the site that were never visit by the american or british offici at the same time a secret new facil wa be built at lakhta near st petersburg far from the biopreparat biolog warfar programm be shut down it had undergon consider modernis work is continu as befor in defianc of yeltsin s order if the stori so far ha not had a happi end for britain and america the sourc of the inform that expos the programm ha been more fortunad todai vladimir pasechnik is happili settl in england he ha a job he love work for a british compani do exactli the civilian research he want to do when he graduat for him the disappoint is that hi sacrific in leav the countri he still talk about with a patriot fond ha not stop the programm he still consid to be a seriou threat to human if thi research is allow to continu in defianc of the polit leadership in moscow it make a

creat in order to carri out the convent and implement an intern control mechan in russia the committe on convent relat problem of chemic and biolog weapon wa also creat in 1992 by an edict of the russian feder presid the committe wa charg with the function of coordin and control in the area of ensur complianc with russia s intern oblig concern the ban on chemic and biolog weapon professor aleksandr gorbovskii chief of the depart for the issu of chemic weapon of the committe answer question put by nezavisimaya gazeta correspond nezavisimaya gazeta aleksandr dmitriyevich what is the statu of implement the convent as of todai gorbovskii the convent ha been sign a period of two year ha been set for particip countri to be abl to ratifi it and prepar to meet their oblig the convent will take effect when no fewer than 65 state ratifi it the convent ha now been sign by 154 state but ratifi by onli four countri which do not have chemic weapon and which actual do not have to assum ani oblig thi is a veri seriou problem for other countri that do have such weapon the condit and facil for the destruct of chemic weapon need to be creat the main proport of the world stockpil of such weapon ar concentr in the unit state and russia thi is why the issu of destroi chemic weapon is the most acut for these two state nezavisimaya gazeta what doe the russian chemic weapon complex amount to on find absolut contradictori inform in the press gorbovskii the russian chemic weapon complex mean first of all the stockpil kept at storag facil the total quantiti of the stockpil ha been declar and come to 40 000 tonn of toxic substanc ov russia also ha facil for the product of toxic substanc the princip facil ar in volgograd and novocheboksarsk chuvashia last year an interdepartment commiss whose task it wa to inspect all storag facil for toxic substanc verifi the reliabl of chemic weapon storag and provis for the safeti of the popul as chairman of the abov commiss i can confirm the number given 40 000 tonn nezavisimaya gazeta is it possibl to sai what the qualit composit of these 40 000 tonn is and in which region russian chemic weapon ar mostli locat gorbovskii the most up to date nerv substanc sarin soman and v ga vi gaz account for approxim 32 000 tonn the remaind consist of obsolet substanc mustard ga and lewisit which have been store sinc as earli as the 1950 s data on the geographi of the locat of such weapon ar no longer secret we have exchang inform with the american on the militari chemic facil the geograph coordin of their locat precis to the second have been provid all these facil ar locat in the european section of russia we have seven storag site toxic substanc mustard ga lewisit ar kept in contain at two site storag is within munit at five site two storag facil out of these five hold missil and artilleri munit and three storag site aircraft chemic munit the easternmost facil is in chelyabinsk oblast those in bryansk and penza oblast ar the closest to moscow the 40 000 tonn ar distribut among these storag facil approxim evenli at 5 000 7 000 tonn per storag site nezavisimaya gazeta what is the guarante shelf life of chemic munit gorbovskii more than 80 percent of toxic substanc ar found within munit whose bodi ensur their reliabl storag the inspect of arsen reveal that a case of leakag ha not been regist at ani of them recent american chemic munit have thinner shell thi is precis why their chemic munit have becom disabl sooner for exampl rocket artilleri munit leak by the mid 1970 s the american were forc to encas them in concret and dump them in the ocean nezavisimaya gazeta what is 40 000 tonn equal to in term of so to sai destruct coeffici gorbovskii a lethal dose of v ga the most up to date chemic toxic agent come to 10 milligram per person thi is a virtual invis aerosol particl it is easi to calcul the number of potenti victim by simpl divis if we know the total stockpil of chemic weapon howev thi would be an incompet calcul it doe not take into account actual condit for the us of all weapon for exampl if we compar how much explos wa us dure world war ii and the number of peopl who were destroi it will turn out that there were hundr of kilogram of trinitrotoluen per person kill the same is the case in the event of combat us of chemic weapon kilogram and ten of kilogram of toxic substanc per each casualti approxim the same casualti rate should also be reckon with dure accid nezavisimaya gazeta what ar the specif of russian problem associ with implement of the provis of the convent gorbovskii unfortun we have to begin work in the area of chemic weapon destruct virtual from scratch after the former ussr announc the discontinu of chemic weapon product 1987 a facil for the destruct of toxic

analysi of the sampl of variou media made in special laboratori indic an absenc of contamin on more danger trend ha begun to manifest itself to combin the program for the destruct of chemic weapon with the resolut of ecolog problem associ with the oper of industri as such all thi caus the program to becom still more expens as a result a situat might develop in which russia will be simpli unabl to carri out the program on time meanwhil accord to the convent the first facil for the destruct of toxic substanc should alreadi be in oper two year after the convent is ratifi in five year 20

in februari of last year the saratov oblast procuraci initi crimin proceed against him for the same reason as the case against vil mirzayanov at first vladimir uglev wa treat as a wit but then

the question of releas the scientist from sailor s rest had been discuss at the highest level he express the hope that the latter would soon be leav the preliminari detent facil as an afterthought the

in 1937 in stalingrad a citi soon to be ravag by the second world war he becam on of the brightest young scientist in the soviet union determin to us hi talent in the caus of peac never allow hi research in biophys to plai ani part in the kind of destruct that had cost the live of hi famili after graduat he did research at the institut of high molecular compound in leningrad work on new antibiot and treatment for supposedli incur ill such as cancer in 1974 he wa approach by a gener from the soviet ministri of defenc with an irresist offer to set up and run a laboratori in leningrad with an unlimit budget to bui equip in the west and recruit the best staff from all over the soviet union it would be known as the institut of ultra pure biochem prepar for pasechnik it wa an opportun to realis mani of hi most cherish ambit in the fight against ill hi earli research wa promis he felt he could produc a cure to some form of cancer until then he had thought he would never have the resourc to complet hi work now he wa be given the chanc to develop on of the soviet union s most advanc laboratori in biotechnolog he accept the fact that the offer came from the ministri of defenc did not worri him unduli in the soviet union the militari wa the engin of most scientif research it had the cash and the peopl to run it even if a scientif project had a strictli civilian applic the militari wa still in charg it wa the soviet wai from 1974 to 1981 pasechnik built up hi special laboratori scour the countri until he had 400 peopl on hi staff a lavish budget and enough hard currenc to give hi scientist constant access to the latest biotechnolog advanc in the west the laboratori began it work in 1981 over the next two year pasechnik realis the truth far from be the heart of a new civilian research oper he wa at the centr of a vast network of factori and laboratori work on deadli new weapon of war offici we were involv in vaccin develop and in produc prepar for protect crop said pasechnik in fact we were develop method of product and equip for a huge biolog warfar programm to begin with pasechnik had littl idea of the scale of the oper onli later did he discov that as well as hi laboratori in leningrad there were two more in moscow two just outsid it and on in novosibirsk all work on the same project five manufactur plant emploi 15 000 peopl were oper in other part of the countri the oper known as biopreparat had a budget of 200m roubl and ten of million of american dollar a year it wa on of the best kept secret of the cold war it task wa to develop new strain of diseas more power than anyth known to scienc and to produc them in aerosol form the germ also had to be resist to antibiot avail to the nato armi of the west the specif job alloc to pasechnik s laboratori staff wa to make them effect weapon of war thei had to find wai of deliv the germ by artilleri shell bomb or missil to ensur that thei had a long life in the open air and that thei could be dispers over a wide area the breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institut of appli microbiolog at obolensk 60 mile south of moscow there with the help of work done at pasechnik s laboratori scientist develop their first super plagu a new strain of tularaemia a sever infecti bacteri diseas of man and domest anim carri by contact or insect bite it is name after tular california where it wa discov the test on it were suffici encourag for moscow to give permiss for full scale develop and product two year later the scientist at obolensk were ask to develop an even more deadli germ base on pneumon plagu anoth airborn infect pasechnik s job wa to refin the product process to make the oper more effici as a result by 1987 the soviet union had suffici industri capac to manufactur 200 kilo of the super plagu everi week enough to kill up to 500 000 peopl the super plagu germ wa of cours never manufactur on thi scale the germ had a short life and onli enough wa made for test but the

not onli as a last resort but as support weapon in a convent non nuclear conflict to attack the enemi s troop reserv and hamper hi oper at port and rail centr everi part of thi programm wa in breach of the 1972 biolog and toxin warfar convent an intern agreement which the soviet union had sign it wa also against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been proclaim by mikhail gorbachev for pasechnik the gorbachev era wa a chanc to try to chang the direct of the programm at hi laboratori in late 1985 he pressur senior offici in biopreparat to let him switch some of hi research effort to the civilian purpos for which it had ostens been establish he got nowher i wa told mani time just to get on with my work and stai in my place he said pasechnik did just that by 1988 he had risen to a rank equival to that of major gener and wa in charg of two manufactur plant and three research laboratori two of these were work on biolog weapon the third wa given to him to placat hi desir to do civil work and also as a cover for the biolog warfar research but pasechnik wa increasingli uneasi he had no idea that hi work wa in breach of the 1972 treati he did not know such a treati exist but he felt that the weapon he wa help to develop were an abus of hi scientif skill and demonstr hypocrisi in the russian militari command about the gorbachev revolut abov all he felt passion that genet engin biolog weapon were a crime against human in late 1988 he began to think about defect despit hi long and illustri scientif career pasechnik had never been allow to travel outsid the soviet bloc then in the summer of 1989 biopreparat began negoti with a factori in toulous franc which manufactur equip for chemic laboratori pasechnik volunt to go to finalis the deal as a reward for hi overal

1979 american intellig had heard report of an explos at a secret soviet research facil on the outskirt of sverdlovsk 850 mile east of moscow a leak of anthrax had kill up to a hundr peopl an area three mile downwind of the factori had been contamin the russian had tri to contain the damag with a widespread immunis programm but it had prove larg useless throughout the 1980 s the leak had been

there wa no biolog weapon programm snippet of inform from sourc in the soviet union suggest otherwis satellit pictur show plant and test site appar configur for the manufactur of biolog weapon the dia

biolog weapon research product and storag site and access to them two month later russia agre to allow a full inspect but fail to admit the exist of all of their site there the matter stand sinc then verif ha prove almost imposs to reinforc western concern the cia brought out a defector from the biopreparat programm in late 1992 he confirm pasechnik s stori and ad to western suspicion that while yeltsin wa claim the programm had stop the research and develop of new strain of genet engin superweapon were continu apac when presid bill clinton and yeltsin met in vancouv less than a year ago biolog warfar wa on the agenda onc again yeltsin assur the american presid that all work had stop thi time yeltsin wa so convinc that even some of the most cynic in the intellig commun were inclin to

concern the fact that thei produc two version of rocket contain toxic substanc with a singl load of two tonn of v ga thei did not send a dispatch to geneva about thi and on for multipl individu target reentri vehicl with toxic substanc in each warhead these missil were appar on combat alert in the ural i do not know whether or not thi is actual true but when i ask the expert what these multipl reentri tactic missil were i wa justifi embarrass it turn out that the warhead do not detach from the tactic missil about which the letter to geneva were written thei were call strateg in the autumn of 1993 gener kuntsevich wrote a thought letter in on newspap sai that it wa time to report inform about our chemic munit to our partner in the negoti perhap it would have been easier not to lie binari weapon dure 1954 1960 the unit state armi began to develop the most sophist kind of chemic weapon binari the subsequ polici for chemic weapon in the unit state develop precis in thi direct but sinc 1969 the unit state ha had no seri product of chemic weapon neither binari nor tradit nonetheless our accus against the american of produc compon and even entir binari weapon continu until quit recent the unit state wa even accus of begin industri product of binari weapon in 1987 as for the soviet union in 1982 gener kuntsevich at that time deputi chief of chemic forc of the soviet armi told the magazin spiegel not of hi own accord of cours but by a decis of the cpsu central committe that the soviet union would not be respons for the escal of chemic weapon he had in mind the binari spiral in that same year of 1982 thei began it thi veri expans and dure the five year period the gener basic move ahead gener ivan yevstafyev 10 year later respond unequivoc to a question about the exist of binari weapon in the soviet union we have no stockpil but ani countri that ha chemic product could have the potenti for produc them the statement from the new deputi chief of chemic forc that the soviet union could have it wa never offici explain in ani other wai than by what follow from it the soviet union thought it had the right to creat it own product potenti for a chemic attack us binari weapon at the present time the public ha the follow inform on the effort made to exercis thi right the fact of the actual develop of a domest binari weapon and in two version base on v ga and base on a so call new toxic substanc the locat of it possibl product which make it possibl to conceal it from intern control the deceas develop and final the honor of the gener in 1991 with bonus for the creation of a binari weapon kuntsevich the lenin prize and yevstafyev the state prize and so the right ha been exercis and in 1989 foreign affair minist eduard shevardnadz speak in the un announc that the ussr and the unit state were prepar to make mutual commit to halt the product of chemic weapon includ the binari type there were still question to be answer no not about how to stop do someth that wa not be done and not about nation secur the understand of which it seem doe not origin in just ani high rank militari head the question is a differ on it seem that the militari chemic complex could have but did thei ask us if we should have done all thi potenti so what do we have left now we us to have a potenti for produc chemic weapon whose mainten turn out to be unnecessari under the condit of disarma and at the end of the prepar of the convent on chemic disarma thi potenti wa destroi in dzerzhinsk volgograd and chapayevsk but here in novocheboksarsk everyth have to do with the output of munit with the latest v ga ha been preserv and there ha been no mention of a balanc of forc the unit state doe not have such a potenti in principl sinc 1969 the unit state ha been unabl to produc chemic weapon at all and it cannot have a modern potenti the most probabl reason for resist of russia s militari chemic complex is that it want to maintain militari chemic superior over it partner in the negoti for as long as possibl in order to mask the preserv of our potenti our militari chemic complex hint at preserv trade secret in the event that an inspect is conduct but thi problem seem contriv it cannot be rule out that termin of the product of modern phosphoru toxic substanc and it inevit convers companion phosphoru and chlorid pesticid whose commerci valu is fairli question in our dai will complet elimin the problem of trade secret of these and accompani process moreov the part of the experi of the iran iraq war which involv iraq s chemic aggress and the death of 3 500 peac resid of iran show that secret of the product of toxic substanc do not exist for that countri in ani case the exist in iraq of stockpil of mustard ga tabun and sarin is no secret either to the chief of the radiat biolog chemic forc petrov or to the intern commun ar the peopl and the armi unit in the unit state long befor the begin of the practic work the legisl groundwork wa done which provid for the ecolog comfort exist of the popul under the condit of chemic disarma the law that were adopt were multipurpos in natur thei not onli provid for ecolog safe destruct of chemic weapon but also protect the popul from ani other ecotoxic gener by technolog in 1984 the unit state adopt a law which made it incumb on the pentagon to destroi the accumul stockpil of chemic weapon let us emphas three point the implement of the decis wa not made depend on the aggress design of the ussr or iraq the onli imper wa the well be of the popul further the militari power of the unit state respons for destroi the chemic weapon engag for approxim 20 year in an intens dialogu with the popul live near the eight storag base on the contin befor reach an agreement that would allow them to start the work final it is the us armi that financ altern ecolog studi near each storag facil where chemic weapon were to be destroi and organ public hear and meet with the local resid and repres of feder and local organ of power in the soviet union prepar for the agre upon destruct of chemic weapon were not begun until the end of the eighti no legisl act were adopt either befor or after from the psycholog standpoint the time that ha pass sinc the declar in 1987 of the termin of the product of chemic weapon ha been spent in vain the attitud of the author toward the popul ha not chang the chairman of the committe on convent problem of chemic and biolog warfar under the presid of the russian feder gener kuntsevich onc note that russia s author in the nation arena depend on the popul s readi to cooper with the committe thi is a pure soviet mistak the repres of the author unconsci associ himself with russia is forget about the bilater natur of ani interact legal entiti and individu the politburo of the cpsu central committe the militari industri complex the ministri of the chemic industri gener kuntsevich never intend to take the interest of the popul into account and well the popul had the correspond attitud toward them the first alarm went off in 1989 in chapayevsk where by a decis of the militari industri complex and the politburo of the cpsu central committe a secret facil began to be construct in 1986 when the popul learn from eduard shevardnadz s speech deliv in a remot foreign citi that chemic weapon which thei thought would be taken far awai were to be destroi at the facil that wa locat 12 kilomet from the citi there wa a social explos the resid demand the inform from an ecolog expert apprais and thei did not receiv it thei formul their own requir for the plan base on it obviou shortcom and thei were not deem worthi of ani answer in gener the govern saw the merit of announc that the facil would be mothbal and refrain from destroi chemic weapon there subsequ there were mani reproach particularli against the intract popul but the reason is plain to see as usual thei boss the peopl around and li to them and it is quit surpris that it never occur to anybodi to apolog to the peopl for the hell of the past year relat to the product of mustard ga and lewisit in ani case the bigwig who came to chapayevsk in 1989 includ the establish of the militari chemic complex made it their first order of busi to go to the club to persuad the popul not to protest and not to the cemeteri to place wreath on the grave of their mother and father who di dure the war and the first year after the war becaus of particip in the product of mustard ga and lewisit the discuss by the author in the autumn of 1992 when resid of chuvashia were told about the construct in novocheboksarsk of the main facil for destroi phosphor toxic substanc plan by a decis of the militari industri complex did not begin with an account for the past either there had been no chemic weapon in thi republ for a long time and thei intend to bring them in from far awai particularli from the citi of shuchy in kurgan oblast across eight or nine region the final stage of the shipment wa the kanash cheboksari section on which i recal at on time thei save monei when chemic weapon first began to be produc again there were no apolog for the past nor ani suggest about pai for it again there wa no ecolog expert apprais the ministri of ecolog okai the plan without consid it again there wa a conspiraci on the part of the author behind the back of the resid of chuvashia and again social resist that end with the destruct of the idea when will thei start talk to the popul while take their interest into account secreci the surg of public after chernobyl which broke open the floodgat of the nuclear branch bypass militari chemist to their great elat it wa simpli that thei had not yet had such a larg scale disast which incident did not make thing ani easier for societi last summer in novocheboksarsk the local state secur caught a moscow greenpeac member outsid khimprom and recent a camera crew from ntv wa not allow on it ground right after some rich uncl from the japanes asaki had visit there without ani troubl thi is on more indic of the psycholog unprepared of our author for anyth at all but the greatest evid is their unwilling to begin the process of declassif of old paper that ar do nobodi ani good on can give at least three reason for the slow in declassifi inform about chemic weapon of the soviet union in the first place russia s withdraw from the chemic standoff after sign the intern convent on chemic disarma januari 1993 leav no room for ani militari chemic secret todai thei ar especi protect the dirti secret relat to direct violat of the law and human right and up to thi dai in thi sphere there ar special court special procur special advoc etc it is necessari to purg such secret becaus thi will give russia confid and respect from the world commun second the exist of the law ban secreci of absolut all ecolog and medic inform regardless of it present secret keeper unfortun is too multifacet third the appear in 1993 of the law on state secret which make it possibl to maintain secreci onli with respect to document from 1964 1993 if there is a need for it that is if thei contain state in thi case defens secret and not department secret that nobodi need as we can see even the present imperfect legal base requir concess from the militari chemic complex in order to make my point i will give not onli the basic composit of the chemic branch of the
