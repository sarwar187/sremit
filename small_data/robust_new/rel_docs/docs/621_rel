simpli a matter of who sai the eucharist prayer we re deal with someth veri import how we understand god how we understand sexual and relat between women and men so long as the church sai that women cannot adequ repres christ at the altar then our theologi is open to question is the gender of god a separ question from whether women should be priest or not she hesit i person don t think it s separ but let s be honest there s no sex to god it s a conveni metaphor we re talk metaphor all the time here and i think we need to enlarg our vision of god all the time but women priest equal femal god is not what i want to sai at all devout anglican see women s ordin as the last nail in the coffin of tradit christian a few have gone further claim that in new zealand it ha caus an outbreak of religi witchcraft there ar as mani or more said the curat who feel it s not fair to dump it all at the feet of women priest to have women as priest redress the balanc a littl bit but no wai doe it alter the

doctrin problem wa the pope s claim to infal and jurisdict over the whole of christendom but he argu under anoth pontiff both claim might be suscept to redefinit so too might the filioqu an obscur but ancient theolog argument about the triniti the latin church claim that the holi spirit proce from god the son as much as from god the father nor the bishop said need there be much disput about the real presenc at the eucharist even though the orthodox regard the roman word transubstanti as a dubiou piec of aristotelian interpol orthodoxi is both more traditionalist but also more mystic fluid and decentralis than roman catholic for exampl it bishop do not take the vatican s hard line on artifici contracept nor on divorc thei permit marri men to be ordain but not priest to marri in relat to anglican the problem is revers there is no histor legaci of hatr but there ar seriou doctrin obstacl there ar high church anglican whose faith is realli the same as our the bishop said but over the past 50 year there ha been a grow liber too on the triniti the incarn and the bodili resurrect we cannot envisag join a bodi where such divers of opinion is possibl and women priest hi answer wa a surpris for he think the gender of the clergi is an open question which ha never been studi in theolog depth hi complaint about the church of england s decis to ordain women is not that it wa done but that it wa done without a proper theolog debat is the differ between men and women onli a matter of procreat or is it much deeper about differ wai of think work and feel the doorbel rang and the bishop went out to meet anoth visitor after a few moment he came back and said there is someth els i would like to sai i do believ that orthodoxi make demand on peopl i would never sai it offer a soft option but i also believ it is a faith as much for english peopl as for greek or russian i didn t becom an orthodox just becaus i like thing greek and russian i becam on becaus i felt i could find in orthodoxi a full and i do veri deliber us that word it s not that i think orthodoxi ha everyth and the western church have noth i simpli believ that the light i had alreadi found in anglican that i m sure can be found also in roman catholic wa to be found in a fuller purer form so it is not that the west ha noth but that the orthodox church ha more have said that i would add that from an empir point of view and for histor reason there ar mani human fail in orthodoxi i don t deni that that is why i think orthodoxi could learn mani good lesson from the west the west can help us to understand our faith better and that s the great benefit we could deriv from talk to western christian not that we would import a lot of western idea that ar foreign to us but see better who and what we ar also
