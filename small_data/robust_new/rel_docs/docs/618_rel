majli by hi deputi mehdi karrubi who as it happen is a lead milit and a close friend of ahm khomeini on of rafsanjani s main challeng khomeini son of the late ayatollah is the rabbl rouser who led riot iranian pilgrim in mecca in 1987 when 400 peopl were kill the veri base of rafsanjani s posit ar under challeng he lack solid polit legitimaci becaus almost half the elector did not vote in the presidenti elect which wa openli rig and he also lack spiritu charisma be a veri differ sort of person from the usual senior shiit cleric rafsanjani befor enter polit under khomeini wa a full time and success millionair trader manag hi famili s pistachio nut busi it is inevit that other ambiti iranian whether mullah or civilian politician should question why thi particular turban wheeler dealer should be the leader of iran on the on hand rafsanjani reveal hi pro western tilt when he proclaim that he wa readi to help obtain the releas of the hostag held in lebanon and for veri practic reason he is desper to obtain western financi and technic assist in the rebuild of iran s war wreck economi on the other hand the milit have been warn rafsanjani not to depart from the line of the imam which remain tough and anti western right to the end of khomeini s life a few dai ago iran s largest newspap keyhan assert that the puriti of revolutionari principl wa more import than monei the west is not help rafsanjani in hi power struggl by prematur and overeagerli prais him for hi help and ascrib to him power for speed the releas of the hostag in lebanon which he doe not actual possess the milit in iran ar led among other by ali akbar mohtashemi the minist of the interior who felt strong enough to throw down the gauntlet to rafsanjani in a recent speech from khomeini s gravesid that denounc those who would concili the unit state and israel the dai befor the majli session ayatollah ali khamenei directli answer rafsanjani s pro western tilt when he deliv a comprehens and angri assault on the unit state as the alli of israel in the struggl with the fundamentalist rafsanjani is in an infinit weaker posit than wa sadat vi a vi hi fundamentalist egypt wa and is a secular state and the egyptian muslim activist after their suppress by presid gamal abdel nasser were small group work underground abl to obtain arm and explos onli with difficulti in contrast iran for the past 10 year ha been a full fledg and milit islam state with anti western fundament as the polit mainstream thi wa back with all the power and charisma of the imam and ha been accept not just by score or hundr or thousand of peopl but by hundr of thousand even million of devout believ as their religi and polit creed in egypt the milit were on the outsid attack the establish in iran a milit establish will have to make a 180 degre turn if it is to accept rafsanjani s pro western anti milit polici there is as much adversari faction down the chain of command from tehran to the shiit group in lebanon hold the hostag as there is at the top layer of polit power in tehran itself thu some person in tehran have their own especi close person link with certain faction and leader in hezbollah the parti of god in lebanon in turn the hezbollah leader have their special connect with on or anoth hostag hold group and these mai be base various in the suburb of beirut in the bekaa vallei or in southern lebanon group have differ interest and object depend on their geograph locat thu the shiit in southern lebanon ar not as involv in the hostag issu as those base in beirut or the bekaa so ani order from rafsanjani ha to follow a tortuou path to it ultim recipi in lebanon thi is further complic by the fact that on the ground in lebanon most of what mai be call shiit territori is control by the amal organ which is pro syrian anti hezbollah and not especi friendli with tehran for exampl when sheik moham hussein fadlallah the spiritu mentor of hezbollah in beirut made a help statement on the hostag aug 11 he wa at the same time contradict by sheik sobhi tufaili address 50 000 shiit at baalbek in the bekaa vallei these split and differ within the iran lebanon shiit structur have to be combin with geographi iran is far remov from lebanon with the link between them pass exclus through syria which ha it own intergovernment differ with tehran moreov there is a gut feel of alien between the non arab farsi speak iranian revolutionari guard and the semit arab speak terrorist the iranian have not endear themselv to the local popul by their crude and arrog behavior thi complex of neg factor make on wonder when the west confid back rafsanjani as a person who will deliv up the hostag whether it ha the least idea of the actual situat in lebanon or whether it is simpli whistl in the dark to keep it courag up the west seem to have learn noth from it sadat experi when it embrac him to death

or militari with iranian support thu throw down a challeng to syria the latter seem more like becaus aoun ha been univers reject especi after the attack by hi forc on the hous and person of nasrallah sfeir the patriarch of the marounit church a syria iran breach would affect the whole region iran s dream of export islam revolut would becom more fantasi like than ever and iran would be far more
