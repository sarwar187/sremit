melanoma of the retina is treat at sever locat such as the psi paul scherrer institut in switzerland origin the purpos of the kek facil wa to verifi the efficaci of proton beam and now that thi ha

becaus thei have both a high let and a bragg peak heavi ion includ ne ar consid to be the ideal radiat which combin both a good dosag distribut and efficaci in relat to cancer with high radiat resist therefor the scienc and technolog agenc is construct a heavi particl beam cancer treatment devic at nir as a part of it anti cancer 10 year plan and clinic research is to begin from the 1994 fiscal
