of ulf merbold a spaceflight veteran who ha been on tow mission aboard the shuttl thi ha also been an appropri time to take a closer look at these mission for which the go ahead decis wa taken at 1992 granada meet of minist respons for space until then the member state of esa had cooper with the russian on man flight on an individu basi onli howev onc the russian had declar an interest in cooper on a wider more european basi the european space minist meet gave esa a remit to negoti new area of cooper the transit period russia ha built up a formid space capabl increas intern cooper is a wai of sustain a us thi capabl more effici to the benefit of all mankind but intern cooper on larg programm such as man spaceflight is also a must for europ the unit state and other space fare nation not onli in term of cost share but also becaus cooper pool technic as well as human resourc gener speak the world todai ha noth in common with the world as it wa five year ago man mission ar now seen in a differ light where there wa competit there is now intern cooper what is take place is in fact a merger of the russian mir station with the intern space station concept thu make it global distinct ar no longer drawn between the west s freedom station and the successor of the russian mir 1 station we ar move into the ag of man flight on a worldwid scale explain jean jacqu dordain associ director for strategi plan and intern polici at esa europ intend to be a full partner in thi develop and thi mean that the plan drawn up in 1987 need to be adjust to take into account the new situat that we have now the deadlin sinc the mir station wa not plan to be oper beyond 1995 6 europ could not wait for year befor put it astronaut into space that is why thi deadlin prompt it to rapidli conduct negoti with the russian the problem confront esa is the rel short period avail for prepar of the experi programm and for train the russian assur that on year wa suffici train for a on month mission such as euromir 94 howev thi assum that the astronaut were of high calibr the russian have confirm that the two candid chosen for thi flight fulli meet the requir for the type of mission involv we have a littl more time for euromir 95 sai jean jacqu dordain even though thi will be the first time a non russian will spend 135 dai in space thi mission requir longer more complex train but the russian who undoubtedli have more experi that us in thi respect have assur us that thi is feasibl on the polit decis had been taken a coher scienc programm had to be drawn up rapidli esa took up the challeng heinz oser the senior life scientist in the esa micrograv programm sai for the first flight we have chosen three main experi theme in life scienc the first will concentr on studi chang in the cardiovascular system when an astronaut leav earth to go into space and monitor hi or her readjust to graviti on return to our plant the second theme concern studi of the human neuro sensori system to gain a better understand of how certain intern mechan react when a human be is subject to near weightless the third theme concern the muscl system which will be measur befor and after the on month long flight in term of muscl strength and mass it is believ that under weightless condit muscl weaken mechan ar differ from those on earth esa ha also select five materi scienc experi which will requir the us of a furnac on mir develop by the czech and two technolog experi for the choic of experi to be perform on mir for the 1994 mission a factor to be taken into account wa also the restrict on the weight of the payload to be brought back by the soyuz capsul which must not exce about ten kilo thi limit ha oblig esa to give prefer to certain experi and even cut down on other for instanc there will be fewer urin sampl than scientist origin plan return time critic experi product to earth is on of the major problem of these mission explain wolfgang nellessen esa euromir project manag on soyuz there is onli limit capac for bring back specimen and sampl in addit to the cosmonaut thi mean we have to decid which product should be brought back as a prioriti and in the event the biolog blood urin and saliva sampl will return to earth with the european astronaut on soyuz the materi scienc sampl mai have to stai on mir until on of the us russian mission when a shuttl will dock with the station and could bring them back the shuttl will visit mir up to ten time over the period 1995 to 1997 foreshadow the develop of a global station sinc euromir 95 is to take place dure the period

therefor be us to consider enhanc the euromir 95 oper 135 dai in orbit the most distinct featur of the euromir mission is the exception long period that will be spent in space thi will be the first time european astronaut will be in orbit for so long 30 dai for the first mission and 135 dai for the second heinz oser thi period which will be far longer than those spent with the american on the shuttl 8 to 14 dai will enabl us to gather much more data for the first flight last 30 dai we have sought to make maximum us of the equip alreadi on board mir howev for the second mission plan to last 135 dai there is more time to develop new hardwar involv european firm experi envisag ar a biokit which will enabl us to expos biolog sampl to micrograv and cosmic radiat and an instrument abl to

FBIS3-21239: languag english articl type cso text foreword the first flight of the us space shuttl in april 1981 herald the era of wing space transfer and return vehicl thi success flight spur the research and develop of wing transfer and return vehicl in variou other countri and led to the launch of buran by the former soviet union and the research and develop of herm in europ there ar two conceiv type of space transfer and return vehicl the wing type and the capsul type the wing type is more effect when oper flexibl is requir in mission such as conduct experi with larg size equip or quickli and accur retriev fly object that elud high graviti load japan start research on a wing transfer and return vehicl around 1986 and ha compil the concept of it own unman wing transfer and return vehicl launch by an expend launch vehicl commonli call hope h ii orbit plane hope will be unman have wing and be launch with an h ii launch vehicl or an h ii deriv launch vehicl it will repair and refuel artifici satellit in space conduct variou kind of experi and observ util the space environ and transport materi to and retriev materi from the space station after carri out variou kind of task hope will reenter the atmospher and land on the earth horizont just as airplan do report of the advisori panel on space transfer and return system in the space activ commiss the space activ commiss approv on 20 juli 1993 a report compil by the advisori panel on space transfer and return system chairman shigebumi saito professor emeritu at the univers of tokyo call for the research and develop of such an unman wing transfer and return vehicl the advisori panel wa set up by the commiss in june last year to studi and discuss japan s futur polici for the research and develop of space transfer and return system the panel compris 25 expert not onli in the field of aeronaut and space but also in other disrel field includ econom and law the panel ha held five meet begin in novemb last year the follow ar the recommend of the advisori panel in their report 1 signific of space develop the develop of outer space within the rang of the earth is man s explor of futur resourc the scientif activ in space to uncov the truth herald a new era for civil and will bring more rich it is necessari for japan as an econom superpow and a scienc and technolog power to plai an activ part in the tackl of space develop to fulli util outer space within the rang of the earth and thu contribut to intern societi 2 signific and necess of space transfer and return system the space transfer and return system is the base of space infrastructur which is a basic system that is capabl of handl a wide varieti of mission an infrastructur is necessari for effici and flexibl space develop activ the transfer and return system is necessari for the servic on orbit such as the verif repair re suppli replac and retriev of satellit the system is also need to conduct experi and observ util the space environ and to transport cargo to a space station the system is indispens for japan s stabl implement of space develop activ in outer space within the rang of the earth the research and develop of such a system will larg contribut to the mainten and develop of transport technolog which is the keyston of space activ as well as to the promot of scienc and technolog 3 basic concept of research and develop of the japanes space transfer and return system it is import to promot the research and develop of hope for practic purpos thi be an unman wing transfer and return vehicl launch by an expend launch vehicl in the earli 21st centuri the need for the transfer and return of cargo in space ar like to increas in the earli 2000s todai no other countri is capabl of provid an unman transfer and return system japan could build it own uniqu statu in the world s space activ by the develop of the unman wing transfer and return vehicl hope furthermor the unman wing transfer and return vehicl technolog could ensur japan s steadi develop of space technolog for the futur as basic technolog for a man transfer and return vehicl a fulli re usabl transport system and a space plane 4 concret polici of research and develop as a basic polici japan should divid the plan into two phase the first stage is for the flight experi r d plan the second stage is for the develop plan for practic us at the first stage it should be accomplish to acquir the kei technolog for hope within thi centuri through the flight of the space re entri flight experi vehicl commonli call hope x hope experi which would enabl japan to establish the technolog in the phase of launch re enter and land at the second stage it should be accomplish to develop hope by mean of ad the necessari mission capabl after the first stage the shift to the second stage should be strictli scrutin by the space activ commiss which should make polici judgment by fulli check technic achiev in the first stage the kei role in the research and develop of the unman wing transfer and return vehicl should be plai jointli by the nation aerospac laboratori nal and the nation space develop agenc of japan nasda outlin of hope the wing transfer and return vehicl hope will be oper unman in whole process begin with it launch follow by entri into orbit chang of orbit de orbit return and land nasda plan to set the gross weight of hope to be launch by an h ii deriv launch vehicl at about 20 ton nasda sai hope should be abl to transfer three to five ton of cargo to and from the space station etc the dry weight of the hope vehicl subtract the weight of propel and cargo from the gross weight will be set at about ten ton and the vehicl structur weight includ heat protect materi will be at about five ton the length of hope will be about 15 meter the width of it wing about ten meter and it fuselag will have a diamet of about three meter tip fin with a height of about three meter will be instal at both end of the main wing hope total flight time begin with it launch follow by it stai in the orbit and end with the land will be between four to seven dai at the time of return hope will de orbit us an orbit chang engin reenter the atmospher at an altitud of about 120 kilomet and go through the aerodynam heat control and balanc glide phase adjust it energi the vehicl will final reach the land strip two practic hope plane would be oper and each would be launch onc a year and would have a life of ten year need to develop hope ar the aerodynam technolog to determin a vehicl shape that is abl to cope with all speed from hyper sonic to low speed and the heat structur technolog to endur aerodynam heat at the time of reentri into the atmospher also need ar guidanc control technolog for the automat navig of hope in all flight process and the technolog of long life propuls final a system technolog to balanc and combin the abov is need therefor as the first stage japan is studi plan to develop critic technolog and to conduct an orbit reentri experi orex automat land flight experi alflex and hyper sonic flight experi hyflex us small model to verifi develop technolog follow the three kind of flight test a flight test us an actual size experiment model hope x is plan as the goal of the first stage postscript the establish of the space transfer and return system is thu indispens for japan s futur space activ and it contribut to the intern societi in the space develop field the scienc and technolog agenc on the basi of the report compil by the advisori panel on space transfer and return system is to promot research and develop aim at put into practic us the unman wing transfer and return vehicl hope launch by an expend launch vehicl in the earli 21st centuri

scienc and technolog have been respons for social and econom progress and for advanc in the standard of live for mankind howev while we have been enjoi thi progress these advanc have impos burden on the earth particularli in the degrad of the environ and in the deplet of energi and resourc two decad ago the club of rome propos in the limit to growth that there should be an overal zero growth to avoid the mankind s crisi anticip in the middl of the 21st centuri and to prevent continu environment degrad of the earth due to industri activ although it predict about the earth mai be valid we have been enjoi an affluent life we have thu come to realiz given the aspir of peopl toward a more affluent life and the orient of develop nation toward modern that zero econom growth is not practic at the present the world popul stand at about 5 5 billion accord to the unit nation white paper thi popul will exce 10 billion by the year 2050 and will continu even further should human activ continu to expand accompani such popul increas and econom growth the support system provid by the earth such an suppli of food resourc and restor of natur mai be destroi it is thu import to control the increas of popul to reduc consumpt and to recycl resourc howev i think that we ar approach to the point where we cannot overcom the foreseen crisi by such passiv measur alon sinc the earth is finit we must look beyond the earth to the infin of space the new frontier with everi effect mean for develop space in order to overcom such obstacl and problem and achiev a sustain develop for mankind in the past columbu in hi endeavor to locat the golden countri japan discov a new contin by coincid five hundr year later we with a firm percept of expand a frontier for human activ ar at the dawn of the second ag of the great voyag the immin challeng of the present space develop in the mission to planet earth which is also the major topic of intern space year isi 1992 i think that in the 21st centuri we will enter the era of mission from planet earth when we ar go to expand our live sphere beyond the confin of the earth and to pursu new discoveri it is inevit and natur for space to becom our theater ever sinc the launch of sputnik space develop worldwid ha undergon major advanc varieti of satellit us for commun broadcast and earth observ man on the moon planet explor man space activ with those tremend advanc dream of mankind have been realiz on after anoth base on our accomplish in space hitherto the concept to expand the human frontier into space might never be castl in the air in order to explor a new frontier in space for mankind the global scale cooper is essenti under reconcili between east and west we will need to organ a new comprehens mechan in the 21st centuri in order to achiev our common target of mankind we will also need to establish a more harmoni system of rule and law what is most essenti howev is to achiev the understand of peopl to rais nation will and to establish an intern consensu therefor it is to sai that the kei is the resolut of mankind to what extent he is will to make the crucial effort hereaft i will focu on what ar technic challeng and to what extent thei ar feasibl in order to expand the new frontier for human activ i will not touch upon the topic of a new comprehens mechan or idea for a system of rule and law speak about the futur space activ in the 21st centuri the content and substanc differ depend on the time horizon i will defin the year 2030 when the current space activ will be termin as the time horizon that i am speak about man in near space if we expect the frontier of human activ in the middl of the 21st centuri the theater will be limit at most to our solar system furthermor i don t think that mercuri or venu will becom the frontier for mankind by the middl of the 21st centuri becaus their temperatur exce 400 c it would also be imposs to includ the planet beyond jupit in thi frontier becaus it take more than a thousand dai to reach from the earth meanwhil mar is somewhat under the similar environ to that of the earth a graviti of 0 38g surfac temperatur from 140 c to 20 c a thin layer of atmospher and it onli take about 240 dai to reach therefor mar can be consid as on frontier for mankind in the middl of the 21st centuri in the middl of the 21st centuri it is conceiv that the artifici celesti bodi near the earth space station spaceport the moon and mar would be the frontier the area in which mankind would be conduct their activ i will call the frontier encompass these bodi near space technolog challeng and respons what technolog challeng must be met for mankind to advanc into near space what respons ar need to overcom such technolog challeng 1 environ for life in space in near space the graviti radiat and thermal environ ar remark differ from those on the earth men have stai in space aboard mir station for up to on year we have learn that man can return to daili life with rehabilit after stai in space for sever dai howev such experi doe not enabl us to fulli understand the impact that long stai in space will have upon the human bodi we must hereaft demonstr how long mankind can stai in space assess long term physic respons to low micro graviti establish the method to maintain health in space the method mai includ provid artifici graviti physic train and rehabilit after return to the earth if these challeng could be resolv through variou experi and test on space station human can stai about on year under micrograv on an artifici celesti bodi and sever year under low graviti on the moon 0 17g and mar 0 38g theoret it s possibl to make 1g graviti by rotat an artifici celesti bodi howev thi is econom infeas becaus it structur and weight becom too enorm as for the radiat environ man can protect himself by the suffici heavi block insul of water metal or other materi thu the challeng is to develop method of block radiat at minimum cost the thermal environ on an artifici celesti bodi can be easili control by the current technolog which ha been appli to most artifici satellit control would also be feasibl if residenti area were construct underground on the moon and mar 2 oxygen water and food oxygen water and food ar indispens commod for man s surviv there ar two wai to provid these in near space transport from the ground or produc them in space it is simpl to transport them from the earth howev transport cost becom too much to support mani peopl live in space for long period it will be imper to obtain materi as much as possibl in near space and to recycl what is us oxygen can be reproduc from exhal carbon dioxid co sup 2 on an artifici celesti bodi oxygen could be obtain through the two process hydrogen reduct of co sup 2 to h sub 2 0 and then electrolysi of h sup 2 0 thi technolog of oxygen plant ha alreadi been establish on the ground the futur challeng ar to improv effici through improv catalyst to reduc size and to develop easili maintain system in addit oxygen could be produc from the oxid metal which constitut 42 of the soil of the surfac on the moon and by us carbon dioxid co sup 2 which constitut 95 of the atmospher on mar research and develop of produc oxygen with similar compound on the ground ha been initi thi technolog will almost certainli be of practic us in the middl of the 21st centuri water can be reproduc by recycl wast hygien water and urin the technolog to recycl water by mean of film filter and distil ha been under develop for space station freedom an advanc system could be util by the middl 21st centuri water can also be produc from lunar soil and from the atmospher or permafrost of mar the product technolog could be of practic us for suppli water in the middl of the 21st centuri food is basic suppli by a comprehens organ recycl system which produc and decompos organ matter a part of thi recycl system with plant onli ha alreadi been verifi on the ground the challeng is to improv thi system for us in space advanc comprehens organ recycl system includ anim ar exceedingli difficult to control so thi system will not be realiz by the middl of the 21st centuri thu astronaut could not enjoi beef but might eat veget and artifici meat produc in near space 3 transport for the transport to the moon or mar two phase method will be probabl emploi rather than the direct transport method like apollo program in thi two phase method two differ type of space vehicl will be develop and us on from ground to the spaceport in low earth orbit and from spaceport to the moon or mar the advantag of thi method is that varieti of space transport system can be flexibl assembl at the spaceport and thu it is not necessari to develop and launch a huge space transport system from the earth to low earth orbit the exist largest launch vehicl ha payload capabl of 100 ton into low earth orbit develop of larger scale launch vehicl for the first phase whose payload capabl is 200 to 300 ton mai be consid econom in the long run becaus we can reduc the amount of launch for the second phase of the transport from earth orbit to the moon mar mission orient system will be assembl at the spaceport if the exist chemic propuls is to be us the propel in particular oxygen will occupi most of the mass the net mass transport will amount to onli on sixth of the total mass for the moon and onli on tenth for mar it will therefor becom necessari to produc propel from resourc on the moon and mar higher perform system such as nuclear power must also be sought the technolog challeng for the futur transport system ar summar in four thrust develop a larg econom rocket with 200 to 300 ton capabl to low earth orbit establish the technolog to assembl larg structur in earth orbit produc propel on the moon and mar pursu nuclear propel system with safeti consider by the middl of the 21st centuri i suppos most of these task will have been definit achiev robot when man advanc into near space robot will plai import role sinc robot do not requir the same safeti and life support system as much as man and thei ar econom advantag it is inde natur to us robot as much as possibl therefor the extent of activ a man can do will depend upon how robot can be develop and us for human activ robot will probabl have made remark progress by the middl of the 21st centuri robot will be abl to receiv verbal command in the languag we us in daili life on receiv such command robot will be abl to think of the procedur to choos the tool and to implement the task when a man on the earth order a robot on mar the modul ha someth wrong pleas repair it the robot will do it the challeng in robot is to develop advanc element and compon electron precis machineri inform process control system and commun system natur languag comprehens imag recognit understand of the surround environ select of the solut and oper plan will also be the challeng for robot these element and kei technolog for robot ar now tremend progress and will be like to make the greatest progress in the 21st centuri after realiz of these technic challeng hitherto mention mankind will be abl to stai for limit period in near space by the middl of the 21st centuri regard man s perman stai in near space we need further effort to studi the long term effect of graviti and radiat on the human bodi befor we can determin whether mankind will be abl to live in near space perman therefor i see that the perman stai in near space will still be the big challeng for mankind even in the middl of the 21st centuri space activ in the 21st centuri base on the preciou observ i would like to show you my concept for space activ around the middl of the 21st centuri 1 on artifici celesti bodi artifici celesti bodi such as a spaceport a space factori solar power satellit space experi observ laboratori will be orbit around the earth for regular mainten of these bodi servic robot will be oper around them a spaceport will be a transfer station for the moon and mar propel suppli and food will be brought to the spaceport from earth to the moon there thei will be load on a vehicl to be transport to the moon to mar or to other artifici celesti bodi the spacecraft is to dock at the spaceport and will be maintain and check there in the space factori materi and pharmaceut with the highest util valu will have to be produc base upon select of variou micrograv experi these factori will have to be maintain by as few peopl as possibl and so will be highli autom energi requir for manufactur and live is to be transmit either by microwav from the solar power satellit or from the solar power plant construct at each space factori sever experi will be conduct in the space laboratori to investig the long term effect of low graviti upon anim and plant short term live in near space will becom easier and eventu tourist will visit for space sight see 2 on the moon on the moon there will be habit area lunarport mine site factori experi laboratori and observatori the lunarport in addit to launch and land facil of vehicl will have a mass driver us a catapult for cargo transport after the initi phase of resourc explor industri mine of resourc will have start by thi time a few peopl will be regularli station at each mine site if nuclear fusion power plant is oper on the earth then mine of helium 3 on the lunar surfac is probabl on a larg scale some lunar factori which will be instal after the verif of the pilot plant stage will be oper a limit number of worker and a lot of robot will be work there product made on the moon will includ oxygen and water structur materi such as brick glass cement steel aluminum and other metal comprehens organ recycl system plant will produc bread veget and artifici meat it mai be possibl by thi time to rais chicken and fish there is no atmospher on the moon to caus flicker which degrad observ from the earth the moon is thu veri suitabl for instal of optic and electr observatori station tourist from the earth mai eventu have vacat on the moon 3 on mar an outpost base will be establish on mar in the middl of the 21st centuri as it take 240 dai to reach mar and the flight opportun is onc everi two year the whole itinerari of on person would take 3 to 5 year therefor the personnel at thi outpost must includ doctor civil engin architect expert on the heat environment control and the life support system and so forth over ten peopl compris variou expert and specialist as well as appropri facil will be requir to support the outpost on mar at the outpost on mar the first stage of the research will be complet and pilot plant will be oper to conduct resourc explor experiment grow veget and breed anim and produc oxygen and water it is wide recogn that mar mai have been inhabit by live creatur by studi the caus of their extinct from mar we mai get import inform about global environment chang the research in thi area will advanc on mar conclus the primari goal of the space activ in the 21st centuri might be the mission from planet earth the concept i present to you is not onli my perspect of the futur but also reflect on my aspir and will as the head of a space agenc i should drive forward to realiz the concept just mention to expand new frontier into space as i mention earlier the space develop of the 21st centuri is go to be grand project which far exce the scale of current space activ it cannot be done sole by on countri but rather should be collabor by joint effort of mani countri space develop in the 21st centuri is not for the nation interest of on countri alon it is an undertak for all mankind and trasncend nation border i hope that thi asia pacif isi confer in commemor of the intern space year will give us the momentum to further strengthen cooper among countri worldwid i wish we would go side by side and jointli challeng toward the futur of expand a frontier for human activ in space

that the life support system ar reliabl under condit of long term weightless is aboard a long durat orbit station two tactic after the success complet in the summer of 1975 of the experi in the soyuz apollo program the american astronaut didn t go into space for almost six year regular space mission were resum in the unit state in april 1981 aboard the space shuttl orbit airplan without their own long durat orbit station the american were forc to be content with short term run into near earth space the us tactic for explor near space wa the opposit of our which consist of long term mission up to a year or more aboard the salyut and mir station true enough about 10 year ago an ambiti program for the creation of the intern freedom orbit station under the aegi of the unit state appear but it wa not judg to be implement becaus of first the consider higher cost of the shuttl flight by comparison with the cost of the project itself and second the amplif of the confront between two superpow in a cold war the latter factor plai a decis role in the fate of the freedom station the fact is that at roughli that time in respons to the placement of soviet missil in countri of eastern europ the

predict by astrolog or collis between the earth and asteroid intern project be that as it mai the american after abandon sdi now had the opportun to devot themselv to the freedom station as a result of the strict budget polici of congress which had cut back the annual appropri for the freedom program to 2 1 billion nasa had to rework the design of the station substanti in order to reduc it size and cost but at that time rumor were afoot that russia which had becom the successor to the soviet union wa get readi to sell the exist mir orbit complex when those rumor couldn t be confirm who after all need a station with onli two or three year of servic life left the us administr strengthen it idea of build a long durat orbit facil with the help of a number of western european countri as well as japan and canada soon after that russia too came to be regard as a potenti partner and by as earli as the summer of 1993 a fundament agreement wa reach between nasa and the russian space agenc rka on the us of unit of the mir 2 orbit complex design at npo energiya and a modifi soyuz spacecraft as a result of subsequ talk includ talk at the government level a version coordin as of decemb 1993 wa adopt for the intern station alpha half of which consist of mir 2 modul the other half of the long durat alpha station wa to be repres by the laboratori and live compart of the unit state the european

purpos of exploit lunar resourc and make astronom and scientif observ the first lunar base will be for short term stai so most of the materi will be ship from earth but ultim plan call for a long term coloni type lunar base that will be entir self suffici the surfac of the moon is an extrem inhospit environ for human to live or work in not mere becaus it lack oxygen but also becaus of the mark differ between daytim and nighttim temperatur and other factor such as cosmic radiat and meteorit so on of the import function of a lunar base is to protect it peopl against those type of harsh condit there have been a varieti of suggest put forward on the type of lunar base to build but among these the underground lunar base seem to have the distinct advantag of be abl to us the surfac layer of the moon as a barrier against cosmic radiat and meteorit base on the abov perspect the takenaka corp ha propos a ga balloon method in which a ga balloon is insert into the surfac of the moon and inflat in such a wai as to form an underground space in thi paper we outlin the ga balloon method and discuss the propos in term of the materi us for the ga balloon 1 technic problem face in construct an underground space on the moon the first thing that we do when construct an underground space on earth is to drill a narrow vertic space which in construct terminolog is call a shaft and then build an underground space at the prescrib depth in the case of the moon howev we cannot expect ani cohes becaus the soil ha no water content thi is quit similar to drill a hole in the desert in which the soil cannot hold on it own so the drill surfac crumbl if we drill a hole into the lunar soil at an angl between 20 and 30 we would have to drill a shaft have 10 time the volum of lunar soil in order to drill to the requir depth that be the case we adopt a method in which the drill surfac is reinforc us temporari build materi such as steel panel and frame nevertheless in build the underground lunar base the follow point below had to be taken into account becaus it would be imposs to us the same construct method on the moon as ar us on earth 1 becaus of the high cost involv in transport materi and machineri from earth to the moon we feel it would be better to limit the us of larg drill equip and temporari materi us in build surfac reinforc 2 work in the harsh lunar environ is extrem danger so we advis a method of construct that is predic on small workload and short work period 2 ga balloon construct method outlin as we have illustr in figur 1 the ga balloon construct method involv build and maintain an underground space by inflat a ga balloon by mean of ga pressur after the balloon is inflat the live quarter insid the underground lunar base ar fill with air have the same atmospher pressur as earth 1 atm if we assum that the specif graviti of the soil on the lunar surfac is 2 0 and that graviti is 1 6 that of earth we find that the intern pressur 1 atm of the space and the graviti of the lunar soil at upper part of the space achiev a balanc state at approxim 30 meter below the surfac in the interfac between the 1 atm space and the lunar soil thi put veri littl stress on the materi us for the interfac and allow a space to be obtain that ha excel durabl and structur stabil figur 1 caricatur of ga balloon method below we list some of the basic reason for construct an underground space us ga pressur a a ga balloon will inflat accord to the pressur of the ga that is introduc into it b a ga balloon start to inflat by passiv destruct of the soil in the area near the ga balloon in figur 2 we illustr the equat for passiv destruct of the soil surround the ga balloon for exampl the initi pressur pi with a hemispher have a 2 5 m radiu can be found in

ga mole within the ga balloon r the ga constant and t sup g the temperatur of the ga balloon in figur 3 we show a model of the process of open up the underground space by ga balloon by introduc an initi pressur p sup i into the ga balloon at a prescrib set that caus a passiv destruct of the surround soil the ga balloon forc asid the surround soil and start to inflat figur 3 inflat process of ga balloon after start the inflat process the ga balloon continu to expand by control the incom ga pressur and keep it at a higher level than the extern pressur p sup o work on the ga balloon i e the soil pressur from the surround soil after the underground space is form to the desir size a balanc is creat between the ga pressur insid the balloon and the extern pressur work on the balloon i e soil pressur from the surround soil the ga balloon construct method offer the follow featur a it requir no major drill work becaus the construct is done by mean of ga pressur b it can reduc the amount of temporari construct materi and work requir for construct by maintain the space by mean of ga pressur insid the balloon until the construct work on the structur insid the base ar complet c it can reduc the amount of structur materi us by count the ga pressur us to maintain the space as part of the actual structur 3 propos concern ga balloon materi in the ga balloon construct method a base is built within an underground space that is form by balanc extern pressur such as soil pressur with the ga pressur of the balloon when a ga balloon is us that is made with an elast materi such as rubber the ga pressur within the balloon must be maintain at a certain minimum level until such time that the build of structur bear extern pressur such as the soil pressur ar complet for that reason a complic ga control mechan is requir that can account for the worker and materi enter and leav the complex ga balloon dure the time that the structur is be built base on that the construct process is expect to be quit complex in order to solv thi problem we propos that a superplast alloi be us for the ga balloon materi 1 superplast alloi ga balloon when the temperatur and distort rate of a metal have an isometr and extrem fine crystal grain structur reach certain level the materi begin to deform with much less stress than it would normal and indic a high elast superplast deform by control thi elast it becom possibl not to caus larg differ in strength and mechan properti befor and after superplast deform in figur 4 we show the ga pressur and temperatur control pattern when a ga balloon made from a superplast alloi is us by keep the temperatur in the superplast region the superplast ga balloon is inflat by ga pressur in the same wai that a ga balloon made from a materi such as rubber would do when the desir space ha been form and the ga pressur adjust so that the inflat stop and the superplast ga balloon cool the balloon lose it plastic and recov it mechan properti as a metal as a result the construct of the base becom extrem easi if the space can be maintain by the materi strength of the ga balloon itself 2 prototyp of superplast alloi ga balloon we prototyp a superplast ga balloon us the prototyp equip shown in figur 5 by sandwich togeth two 1 6mm thick panel made of an aluminum base superplast alloi figur 4 pressur and temperatur control pattern aa7475 in photograph 1

seem almost imposs therefor the ga balloon method could be on of the more effect wai of build an underground lunar base nonetheless there ar quit a number of technic problem that still remain to be

technolog text introduct scientist began to consid take advantag of the weightless environ of space character by have no convect no buoyanc no sediment no static pressur and no contact float dure their research in the 1960s experi in space began to be realiz in the 1970s when skylab the apollo rocket and soyuz spaceship were launch howev good result were not obtain easili these featur of the weightless environ in space can be best exploit when the specimen involv in the experi is fluid in form the reason for good result not be obtain dure those earli year is thought to be that research did not have suffici knowledg of fluid phenomena the materi process technolog we ar us todai is base on the technolog that have been accumul through continu research conduct sinc the dai scientist attempt to creat gold and silver from ordinari metal hundr of year ago compar to thi long histori of effort our experi in space is still too meager in the first materi process test program fmpt experi conduct recent that involv creat new materi aboard a us space shuttl the total hour accumul by japanes research in space wa about 150 even if the hour of experi conduct by japanes research under weightless condit ar ad the total is still short of 1 000 hour make the space materi process technolog no match for it ground counterpart in term of matur in thi sens we must promot basic physiochem research due partli to the challeng disast materi research in the micrograv environ of space made littl progress in the 1980s howev sinc enter the 1990s the platform enabl materi experi to be conduct

sever month need to grow protein crystal the platform select should be determin by take thi time factor into account due partli to the few chanc for conduct experi under micrograv condit that have been avail so far research have tend to make propos for new experi randomli without consid whether such experi ar realli worth undertak now with a number of these platform have becom avail we must make propos that can take advantag of these platform we can expect that the era of the 1990s will produc mani signific achiev in our effort to develop space technolog for three year start in 1991 japan ha been conduct the tr ia program by launch a seri of small research rocket in 1992 japan carri out the master and fmpt program follow by the d 2 project carri out aboard a us space shuttl and the ga project implement in 1993 a seri of experi under weightless condit is schedul in the come year includ the launch of an express satellit with a recover capsul in 1994 and the sfu free flyer program in 1995 in 1992 a free fall tower the tallest in the world wa construct on japan s northernmost main island of hokkaido the facil is alreadi avail for conduct experi under weightless condit the construct of a space station is current under wai schedul for complet in 1998 while the construct is be carri out by the unit state japan and european countri ar particip in the space station program import of promot microscop observ in recent year great progress ha been made in the field of microelectron technolog a technolog need to produc semiconductor devic the linewidth requir to creat these devic ha shrunk steadili from micron to submicron order and now research ar develop a technolog that will make it possibl to control molecul level dimens the need for thi technolog is mount not onli for semiconductor devic develop but also in the field of new materi develop chemistri and biotechnolog the need for the technolog that will enabl the observ and manipul of molecul level and atom level dimens ha been increas in recent year on of the theme for which the agenc of industri scienc and technolog is activ promot r d is atom technolog thi effort involv the develop of a technolog that will make it possibl to observ measur and manipul individu molecul and atom on the surfac of variou kind of substanc and materi under differ condit i e the develop of a technolog that will make it possibl to measur or observ on the spot the format of atom cluster their concentr dispers and reaction among them within a three dimension space as well as research aim at theoret unravel the process involv in absorpt desorpt dispers and reaction the agenc is also promot research on quantiz function element thi research aim at develop new function element by fine control such quantum phenomena as the tunnel effect manifest in ultra microstructur the wave motion of electron and the transit between differ quantum level the research to develop the element ha been step up sinc progress ha been made in shrink the dimens of the semiconductor devic circuit the product of these devic call for these well control element to be avail when the circuit featur shrink the requir for element becom increasingli stringent the weightless space environ could provid the experi condit suitabl for develop these quantiz function element when the requir for metal materi becom stringent it becom necessari to improv the characterist of these metal by promot research at the grain level i e the constitu element each of these grain in turn is compos of microstructur that develop dure the growth process of the dendrit structur the condit of the dendrit growth within these microstructur greatli affect the paramet requir for these metal such as the paramet for mechan strength research on dendrit growth ha been conduct for the past 50 year despit thi long histori of research it is onli recent that the quantiz of such growth ha becom possibl an articl by js langer which wa carri in the octob issu of physic todai point out that dendrit growth is affect by the fluctuat of temperatur in the boundari interfac between the surfac of the solidifi substanc and the adjoin atmospher as well as by minut chang in the surfac tension the author went on by sai that while these paramet ar import thei have been ignor so far figur 2 not reproduc is the schemat represent of the solidif of a metal substanc at on moment dure the solidif process on the ground and it can be seen that the crystal is grow upward on the ground air convect occur abov the surfac of the solidifi substanc howev in the boundari interfac convect disappear becaus the convect is imped by a drag caus by the viscos of the air in the interfac it ha recent been found that the molecul present in the solidifi interfac plai an import role in a weightless environ convect like that observ on the ground doe not occur creat the condit suitabl for conduct the microscop observ on the ground x rai is the onli mean us to conduct the microscop observ of metal howev it is unrealist to lift an x rai system to space to conduct similar observ becaus of thi organ substanc such as saxinonytril ar commonli us as the specimen for us in space experi through the 1990s space experi aim at unravel the solidif process will be conduct us these organ specimen grieksman of the unit state ha found by conduct mani experi on the ground that the crystal process is influenc by graviti he is schedul to conduct an experi involv the growth of the dendrit crystal us a us space experi system usmp in japan experi to measur the temperatur of the atmospher in the solidifi interfac were carri out under weightless condit by launch small master 5 rocket carri a mach zehnder interferomet the experi were promot and conduct by ishikawajima harima heavi industri mitsubishi research institut japan societi for the promot of machin system and the societi of japanes aerospac compani these experi made it possibl to see clearli the heat radiat from a solidifi substanc into the atmospher adjoin the substanc and the chang in radiat level in the form of video imag figur 3 not reproduc show the printout of on of the frame of imag obtain by a mach zehnder interferomet the imag in the right half of the printout render in the form of finit interfer fring show the chang in the atmospher temperatur near the substanc over time in term of temperatur profil curv the imag in the left half render in the form of infinit interfer fring can be us to measur the temperatur recent high expect have been place on the result of research that ha been under wai in an effort to us the light scatter phenomenon as a mean of observ the crystal of a solidifi substanc the effect of surfac tension becom conspicu in a weightless environ and in thi sens it is import to conduct further research on surfac tension to clarifi the crystal process in septemb 1993 an experi for observ the dendrit growth process wa to be conduct us the schlieren optic observ system by launch a tr ia3 rocket the adopt of the observ system make it possibl to realiz a visual rendit of the crystal growth process when a solidifi substanc is subject to supercool condit advantag of weightless experi environ in the follow thi author will describ the advantag of the weightless experi environ by cite some concret instanc as describ abov the need for realiz atom level control in develop semiconductor devic is mount these dai howev on the ground the convect in the atmospher ha imped the realiz of crystal growth with no defect convect caus temperatur fluctuat in the solidifi interfac of a grow crystal which caus chang in densiti these coupl with supercool and intern thermal stress lead to the appear of defect within the grown crystal in addit convect within a melt fluid caus nonuniform in the materi composit and the distribut of impur in the direct of crystal growth no convect no buoyanc and no static pressur these ar why the weightless environ of space draw such high attent under weightless condit uniform crystal can be attain becaus convect doe not occur in addit weightless condit make it possibl to produc a larg temperatur gradient in the interfac of the crystal substanc thi in turn make it possibl to limit the supercool depth in the surfac of a liquid phase substanc to veri shallow a condit requir to realiz the stabl growth of a singl crystal as new type of materi the alloi which ar made us iron nickel or cobalt as the base materi and which displai high strength and tough at high temperatur have been draw attent in recent year these alloi ar creat by scatter ceram or metal oxid or by coat them with a ceram film in order to produc these alloi in space it is thought that process method which ensur the uniform dispers of materi or the orient solidif of materi must be us the uniform dispers method could be us to produc a materi in space by dispers fine materi compon uniformli across the matrix materi or to produc a composit materi by have the reinforc fiber embed in a regular pattern by take advantag of the absenc of buoyanc and sediment in the space environ the orient solidif that make it possibl to realiz a larg temperatur gradient within a melt fluid can be us to produc turbin blade the experi that will be conduct in space us these method will includ on to improv the heat withstand abil of super alloi by dispers ceram on on unidirect solidif and on to creat singl crystal amorph alloi can be creat by introduc silicon boron phosphoru zirconium hafnium or niobium into such transit metal as iron nickel or cobalt and by subject the melt mixtur of these metal to supercool take advantag of the fact that it becom a solid with the same kind of atom sequenc that it ha in the liquid state in other word by super cool on doe not have to take the time to realign it in the correct sequenc thi caus the amorph alloi to manifest high tough and high corros withstand abil which the origin metal did not cool the melt fluid in space would make it possibl to produc larger amorph crystal by restrain the format of the crystal nuclei from the portion where the ground product process make the fluid come into contact with the vessel hold it as for us in optic fiber commun effort ar under wai to develop a glass with high transpar low transmiss loss in the near infrar rang the develop of such a glass call for the introduct of an advanc process and product technolog that will make it possibl to greatli reduc the impur content on the ground glass product requir the us of a platinum vessel sinc glass react with refractori materi at high temperatur it is thought that a highli pure glass for which no impur can be trace to the vessel hold the materi can be creat by melt and solidifi the materi while float them in space in the meantim the govern industri research institut osaka of miti agenc of industri scienc and technolog is conduct joint research with the univers of missouri and loyola univers of the unit state to creat glass particl with diamet of a few micron in a weightless environ for medic applic we anticip good result will be forthcom from the research the experi conduct by usml in 1992 to grow protein crystal in space drew substanti attent from scientist around the world as a pioneer attempt to produc medicin in space protein crystal is brittl and a larg crystal cannot be creat on the ground due to the effect of air convect and sediment a larg crystal is not necessarili need as the materi for produc medicin howev to determin the suitabl three dimension crystal structur of a medicin under develop the avail of a larg high qualiti crystal is essenti it is said that mani recent develop drug have been design to be effect against specif virus in order to reduc side effect in order to develop these drug unravel the three dimension structur of the protein crystal involv is import produc these crystal in space is costli therefor for the time be the us of the weightless environ of space will be confin to the develop of drug against cancer and aid the two major diseas afflict the world todai which must be control at all cost in the meantim miti in cooper with dara of germani plan to conduct an experi to grow a zeolit crystal in 1994 by launch an express satellit the product of the experi will be recov in a capsul zeolit is said to be us for us in petroleum refin and for reduc diesel engin exhaust just like a protein crystal a larg zeolit crystal cannot be produc on the ground thu far zeolit ha been creat by determin the crystal structur base on experi the catex program is design to conduct a seri of experi to grow a zeolit crystal in space the first space flight last five dai will make it possibl to conduct experi by take full advantag of the weightless condit in space after the experi have been complet the satellit will be recov to obtain the data that will make it possibl in the ensu catex experi to conduct detail observ of the crystal growth process by make full us of the on the spot observ technolog avail the experi conduct by us a free fall tower or within a space station ar character by the fact that thei can get the support of specialist everi time an experi is conduct as far as the diagram in figur 1 not reproduc is concern the free fall tower and space station give the impress that thei present experi platform with opposit capabl and perform the us of a free fall tower make it possibl to conduct experi under weightless condit us the experi system as sophist as the on us on the ground even though the dimens of the system ar limit by the size of the capsul us in the free fall facil a space station can emploi a low acceler propuls system like a space shuttl in addit a space station make it possibl to accommod equal sophist experi system and allow the adjust or repair of these system to be made by astronaut when the need aris the nation space develop agenc is alreadi develop the experi system for joint us in space station in parallel with the develop the agenc ha been encourag peopl to propos theme for experi to be conduct in a space station sinc 1992 howev the author s opinion is that such sophist experi system must be creat not by the agenc but by those establish which will be conduct the experi within the space station the experi conduct us these platform involv the us of sophist experi system oper by specialist will greatli help to build a databas on thermal properti valu for exampl in order to simul the growth of a semiconductor crystal properli accur thermal properti valu must be us to melt the materi it is imposs to measur these valu accur on the ground becaus of convect the space technolog corpor ha conduct a seri of experi to measur the thermal conduct of a number of materi under weightless condit creat by us a free fall tower and by launch small texu rocket base on the result of these experi the corpor report that there is a differ in the thermal conduct of insb between the valu measur on the ground and the on measur under weightless condit accord to the corpor s data the valu is the same within solid specimen but differ appear when liquid specimen ar us figur 4 not reproduc thi data will contribut to build the databas germani ha been conduct experi to measur the surfac tension thermal conduct viscos coeffici and other properti valu of a number of materi us a tempu magnet float furnac for the time be it is import for us to accumul data on as mani materi as possibl by chang the paramet us such a furnac these effort ar what must be undertaken and promot by research us the two differ type of experi platform describ abov expect for super high vacuum environ a last vacuum condit is anoth characterist of the space environ howev at the altitud space shuttl fly in space the vacuum level is not as high the vacuum at these altitud deterior to around 10 sup 4 pa due to the gase come out of the shuttl in variou form and the water discard from the shuttl at thi point come the idea of us the wake the term wake refer to the trace creat on the surfac of water behind a ship when it travel the vacuum level at an altitud of 300 km from the earth s surfac is dictat by the partial pressur of the atom oxygen an element which account for the largest percentag of those element present at the altitud the partial pressur usual rang from 10 sup 5 to 10 sup 6 pa by assum that the gase of these residu element have a maxwel s distribut pattern the molecular temperatur of these element approach 1 000 k at these temperatur the movement veloc of these element thermal molecul is about on tenth the orbit speed of a satellit and thi prevent the molecul from scatter behind the satellit thi produc a wake of a high vacuum level behind a fly satellit specif the travel speed of a satellit is a few time faster than the movement speed of the thermal molecul of hydrogen and helium and about 10 time faster than the movement speed of the thermal molecul of oxygen and nitrogen thi mean that the element that can catch up with the satellit ar confin to the veri small portion of maxwel s distribut that ha a veri high movement speed thi realiz an area with a veri low element densiti behind the orbit satellit base on these assumpt the vacuum level in the wake creat behind a fly disk measur 10 m in diamet reach a maximum of 10 sup 13 pa in term of the partial pressur of hydrogen figur 5 not reproduc in term of the partial pressur of helium it come to 10 sup 16 pa while in term of the partial pressur of atom oxygen it extend to as low as 10 sup 33 pa these figur ar equival to a singl atom of these element exist within a space of a few hundr cubic kilomet the fact that the wake ha no wall mean that a larger vacuum space is creat behind the disk with the pump speed approach infin and thu a good weightless environ is realiz the univers of houston in the unit state plan to grow a thin film of gallium arsenid in a wake experi to be conduct aboard a space shuttl in orbit by erect a 3 6 m disk in the shuttl s cargo bai the first experi wa schedul to take place in novemb 1993 the univers plan to conduct three more wake experi after thi as describ abov the next gener semiconductor devic call for atom level devic process technolog under thi increasingli stringent requir epitaxi technolog is on of the most reliabl process technolog avail todai the background vacuum level current avail when grow a thin film us the mbe or cbe method stand at 5 x 10 sup 9 pa howev when these epitaxi film grow system ar in oper the vacuum level deterior to 1 x 10 sup 6 pa for the former method and to 10 sup 3 pa for the latter the system commonli us on the ground ha mani such chamber for grow the film an increas in the number of chamber caus further deterior of the vacuum level thi coupl with the lower of the vacuum level when the system is in oper could lead to impur find their wai into the synthes thin film due to the scatter occur near the specimen when grow a thin film when the specimen is switch the contamin from the chamber wall due to the hysteresi effect of a specimen us previous appear these impur affect the characterist of these synthes electron materi even if their content ar veri small even if the densiti of a dopant is veri small for exampl at the level of a few ppt that cannot be detect by chemic analysi it introduct can chang the electron properti of a substanc in order to grow a superlattic it is said that the densiti of the impur flux must be reduc to lower than 5 x 10 sup 3 atom cm sup 2 per second thi is equival to a partial pressur of lower than 2 x 10 sup 16 pa epilogu the product process that take advantag of the weightless and super high vacuum environ of space will meet the requir for produc advanc electron materi which call for an abil to control the characterist at the molecular or atom level until recent the us of sophist experi system in space ha been hamper by the malfunct of the system caus by the mechan shock of launch and by the lack of electr power in orbit thi coupl with the problem of not have the opportun to us the system due to the few avail ha discourag research from conduct experi in space howev in recent year the chanc to conduct an experi under a weightless environ ha increas with the avail of variou experi platform includ the complet of the world s tallest free fall tower in japan when the construct of the space station is complet it will becom possibl for us to conduct experi us experi system as sophist as the on we us on the ground the decad of the l990 ha wit a diversif of weightless experi platform includ the avail of the unman sfu free flyer and express satellit with a recover capsul research in thi decad will be abl to select the type of platform most suitabl for their experi a situat differ from the 1980s when thei had littl choic and had to conduct experi by adapt the experi condit to the avail platform thi decad will make it possibl for us to take greater advantag of the space environ in

550 kg h 1 thei told the nation aerospac develop agenc of japan nasda that futur satellit had to be much larger as thei saw increas need for larger commun satellit and that wa inde the start of the h 2 project the h 2 launch vehicl thu develop is 49 meter in total length and weigh 260 metric ton befor launch the main propuls system consist of two stage rocket both us liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propel the two stage combust principl us in the h 2 s first stage engin is similar to that of the us space shuttl and the russian energiya that wa the kei to the overal success of the project the first stage engin dub the le 7 is a highli effici engin capabl of convert everi gram of propel carri in the tank into a thrust forc of cours it is not the first japanes engin to us liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as the propel the le 5 engin which wa us as the second stage engin of the h 1 wa base on the same principl with the le 5 a portion of the liquid propel wa vapor to us it expans energi to drive the turbopump and the propel us for drive the turbopump wa discard after that result in poor engin effici in the two stage combust system which wa the kei develop item of the entir project the ga produc in the first stage combust is us for drive the turbopump then the propel remain after the first stage combust and the propel pump directli from the tank into the combust room ar mix and caus to react as the propel is burn in two stage it is call the two stage combust system ishikawajima harima heavi industri develop that turbopump wherea mitsubishi heavi industri develop the main bodi of the engin the engin gener 86 metric ton 110 ton in the vacuum of thrust at sea level which exce the averag sea level thrust of 77 ton gener by the mb 3 engin us on n type or h 1 rocket the engin wa the most difficult part of the entir project an explos dure the develop of the turbin result in a loss of human life and yet anoth explos dure a combust test caus the disintegr of the engin thu forc the launch schedul to be put off for two year the develop of a launch vehicl is often said to be built on the number of engin destroi dure the develop the fact that thei had onli two year of delai from the origin schedul is commend the first stage rocket engin is attach to a pair of solid propel rocket each of which is pack with a solid polybutadien propel and measur 1 8 meter in diamet and 23 meter in length thei provid an addit total thrust of about 300 metric ton 159 ton each thi auxiliari rocket wa develop by nissan motor which is consid quit depend becaus it long histori of rocket develop date back to the good old dai of the pencil rocket that same rocket will be us as the main engin of the next gener j 1 small launch vehicl j 1 is a small econom launch vehicl that is schedul to lift the prototyp of hope the japanes version of the space shuttl the second stage engin of the h 2 is the le 5a a modifi model of the le 5 which ha prove itself as h 1 s second stage engin the engin wa modifi from the ga gener system to the hydrogen breed cycl system it produc 12 metric ton of thrust in a vacuum the fair for enclos a payload such as a satellit wa also develop with domest technolog thi time although it had been import from the unit state a huge fair have a total length of 4 meter wa develop by kawasaki heavi industri which join in the rocket manufactur busi for the first time with the success of the h 2 launch vehicl japan is enter it larg rocket era the h 2 can place a 2 metric ton satellit into geostationari orbit altitud 36 000 km a cargo weigh about 10 metric ton into low earth orbit such as a cargo to a space station a satellit weigh about 5 metric ton into a sun synchron orbit altitud about 700 km or a satellit weigh about 6 metric ton into an orbit with an altitud of 1 000 km it will also be abl to haul a surveyor weigh 2 metric ton to the moon or mar fulfil mani space develop dream improv function provid competit against us and european vehicl moreov the vehicl s capabl can be easili enhanc by ad more booster rocket it will be abl to place a satellit weigh as much as 4 5 metric ton into geostationari orbit variou version ar also possibl it capac is compar to the launch capabl of the arian iv which wa develop by the european space agenc esa in 1988 and is current oper by arianespac 2 3 metric ton to geostationari orbit or the capabl of the us titan 3 2 2 metric ton to geostationari orbit the upgrad version of the h 2 will have a capabl equival to the arian v 4 5 metric ton to geostationari orbit to be test by esa in 1995 or the titan 4 same capac which is alreadi in servic of cours everyth is not rosi in the japanes space era be usher in by the h 2 the manufactur of each h 2 cost about 16 billion when ad to the launch cost which is estim to be about 3 billion the total cost becom 19 billion that is high by comparison with oversea competitor the yen which wa valu at 240 to the us dollar when the project start is now 120 to the us dollar there is no wai to compet with the vehicl of other countri that ar launch at a cost of about 10 billion also nasda hand ar ti by the fact that it ha onli on launch site and launch window ar avail onli twice a year howev the cost reduct effort ha alreadi begun and there ar predict that a 20 30 percent cost reduct is possibl through mass product also the oper issu that had been postpon until the success of the launch ar now begin to be review so that it is certain that our intern competit will be re evalu soon

tomorrowland but in a speech a year ago on the 20th anniversari of the first apollo land on the moon presid georg bush in what he call a journei to tomorrow propos a real man flight to mar with that speech bush ignit an ongo debat about how much the nation should be spend on it space program and what it long term goal should be congress is debat whether to provid seed monei dure the 1991 fiscal year to studi the prospect for establish a man base on the moon and send a man space flight to mar two project that togeth ar known as the space explor initi for now the mar mission will take a back seat to other nation aeronaut and space administr program nasa first order of busi is to begin launch the initi compon of the space station freedom by 1995 and build an outpost on the moon by 2005 meanwhil a host of aerospac compani have begun explor technolog that could be us for a mar mission among them mcdonnel dougla in huntington beach ford aerospac in newport beach lockhe in calabasa gener dynam in san diego rockwel intern in pittsburgh pa and martin marietta in bethesda md each team is busi gener a rang of option about how to undertak the costli and technolog difficult 35 million

discuss the subject of a mission to mar with on such enthusiast charl a ordahl vice presid and gener manag of the advanc product develop and technolog divis at mcdonnel dougla space system in huntington beach ordahl a 34 year veteran at the compani wa chief engin for the delta rocket program and is current in charg of the firm s strateg plan and research on the space explor initi q how long have we thought serious about go to mar a it s alwai been within the aspir of the unit state space program that somedai we would go on to mar but we ve taken a steppingston approach with earli explor on the moon the shuttl the develop of the space station and final plan lead to mar if you take our space station effort as the first steppingston we start as earli as 1960 we ve been work on it more intens within the past year sinc presid bush s speech q so presid bush s speech wa a motiv forc behind renew effort to go to mar a i think the presid want to provid a new and inspir goal for the nation he decid we should have a long rang space program with mani facet to it he said we should first complet the build of space station freedom which is alreadi under wai we would then go from that base back to the moon and build a base for scientif research then go to mar and explor it becaus it is the planet in our solar system most like the earth it wa in part a respons to critic that we didn t have a long term goal for a long time q what wa the time frame a there wasn t ani at first but the presid said in mai that by the year 2019 we would be on mar that make it much more credibl q what ar the technic challeng of a trip to mar that make it such a long rang mission a we ve alreadi conquer the idea of go to space but we re deal with a much longer period of time a shuttl flight last seven dai a flight to the moon wa about three dai and a flight to mar would be six month to a year on wai so on of the big problem is the length of time man would have to spend in space that expos him to thing we don t fulli understand yet such as cosmic radiat and zero graviti environ there mai be psycholog effect with the space station we will learn how to address some of those question such as have peopl in space for longer period of time a second challeng is simpli to build the life support system for maintain life for extend period of time that will requir new technolog advanc such as a life support system that recycl either food or wast we ll also need better propuls system we have shown so far that we can do a mar mission with some of the type of chemic propuls system we have todai but some of the thing we re look at ar reduc the amount of propel requir and increas the speed of the spaceship there is a possibl of us nuclear propuls other challeng ar build infrastructur on the moon for a perman presenc we d want to us materi on the moon to do that that would be an altogeth new wai of do thing q do you have to have a base or space station to get to mar a that ha been a subject for debat some peopl argu that we should go straight to mar and save monei that wai but the presid s posit appear to be it s a more prudent approach to go to build the moon base first and learn along the wai it would probabl be easier to build the mar ship in space or on the moon base q is it settl that the spaceship will be man a noth ha been settl we believ so far that thi will involv a combin of man and unman mission it s gener felt robot mission should go first becaus you can afford to learn how to proce it is also felt that ultim we want to send human becaus no matter how much you try you cannot replac the intellect or dexter of man he can adapt to hi own sens on the site plu it s also more excit to the american peopl it wa excit to me to watch the first vike probe land on mar but it wa far more excit to watch man put hi foot on the moon 20 year ago man is an import part of thi mission for lot of reason that touch the soul of humankind q will that mean it will take a lot longer to get there a some problem ar uniqu to man and that could mean more time but man ha alwai been a veri basic part of our space program from mercuri gemini apollo the shuttl the space station thi is just the next step a lot of what we talk about here is a long term perspect of where we as a world ar go q estim of the cost ar 300 billion to 500 billion right a it s veri difficult for me to assess cost we have made our own assess base on a particular architectur and plan the govern ha made some estim in the rang you mention it s an expens program but it s also a great invest in the futur and though the number is larg when you spread it over 30 year you re get a better perspect it add up to less than 1 of what govern spend in a year you have to put that in the context of what we spend each year on defens q will thi be a hard sell for the american peopl a i don t think so poll i ve seen show there is a great deal of support for the program it s veri import we have a certain invest in the futur q what ar the benefit a it s difficult to quantifi on ha to think in term of thing that have been achiev so far in the space program for instanc it ha benefit for our educ system we hear about a lot of problem in scienc and math where we ar in a competit battl with other nation program such as a trip to mar have a wai of inspir peopl to go into these field whether thei ever work in the space busi is incident when kid ar in the fifth or sixth grade and thei see thing happen with thi program thei will want to learn more that s onli on benefit for the educ system you have to invest and it usual pai off with someth entir differ from what you expect you can tell that stori mani time in the medic area you can point to cat scan as benefit from the space program thi move technolog forward there ar other reason there is an imper to explor like with columbu move to the new world the pursuit of new knowledg we make progress as a nation becaus we learn new thing if you look at the geologi of mar the expert tell us it us to be veri much like earth a long time ago todai mar is veri unlik earth onc it had liquid flow in channel why did mar evolv so differ mayb there is a clue to ensur the well be of our own planet we don t know for sure but we can try to find out q with the convers of the defens industri more aerospac compani ar go to have to build someth besid weapon is that a sell point for mar a i think so especi with the polit condit in the world todai most peopl believ convers of the defens industri will happen there will be a fair amount of distort in the econom impact of that the nation need a certain amount of thi kind of invest in defens and it s import we not do too much to chang the amount of work go into defens research i believ that mar is a good invest a sourc where you can put the fund dure the transit that s a fairli potent argument for the program q can you outlin an exampl of current think for a mission to mar a the main exampl we ve look at is build a larg rocket that can deliv sever hundr thousand pound of payload into low earth orbit which is well abov the 50 000 pound the shuttl could carri sinc it would be too heavi to launch from earth we would carri the part up and assembl a spaceship at the space station it would have a crew compart for about four peopl a larg amount of the weight would be propel onc it wa assembl with robot it would take off on a trajectori to mar when it near mar it would enter into mar orbit a portion of the ship would land on the planet itself the first mission might stai on the surfac for 30 dai it would us aerobrak technolog which is a devic that work like a parachut to assist in slow down the vehicl for the land that would be more effici than carri fuel for revers rocket to slow the ship down overal it would not be unlik the explor of the moon the astronaut could us space suit and rover and explor onc have complet the mission thei would have to take off from the surfac here we could us sever scenario with on lander that would be us go down to mar and anoth to take off the return vehicl would dock with the ship and then it would take six month to a year to get back to the space station onc we near earth we could either land at the space station and catch a ride down in the shuttl or enter the earth s atmospher directli asid from the time space and propuls capabl it s not differ from go to the moon but it s a long reach and a lot of new technolog is requir q what ar some of the project your peopl ar work on a some of us ar work on specif research and develop project try to develop life support system that recycl energi make propel out of lunar soil or think about how to make a ship that could us solar energi some of our peopl ar look at solar sail as an exot wai of power a spaceship thi would be a larg devic like a sail that would absorb rai from the sun and us the solar photon as fuel so you could reduc the weight of the spaceship and save on cost altogeth there ar more than 60 project under wai q earlier you mention nuclear propuls a i m no expert but nuclear propuls could cut the flight time at least in half and mayb more we did have some nuclear propuls program 20 year ago but noth sinc on difficulti here would be test you have to test these propuls system twenti year ago you could do it part of it is just go out and pick up where we left off q among mar enthusiast what s the level of satisfact about how fast thing ar move a i would be happi if thing went faster but i m thrill we ar go as fast as we ar becaus the presid is a great leader on thi issu we would be move a lot slower without him i understand the constraint and prioriti that limit how fast we can do it but there should be no limit on the resolv to do it sure i would have been happier if we pick up after apollo and progress like pioneer rocket scientist wernher von braun want to so that we would have been on mar in the 1980s in the meantim we have a work shuttl program and the space station is be built q so it s a combin of gather polit support and build the technolog you need to go to mar a right there need to be more time put into some of the issu thei have to be discuss with the american peopl polici maker in washington and the rest of the world it will take some time to get peopl into it q is it more difficult in thi ag of big deficit a sure but dure the apollo program we spent 4 of our nation budget on our space program todai we spend about 1 and we re talk about spend anoth 1 our prioriti ar differ now dure apollo we were compet with the russian and that gave it a high prioriti q how much ha been budget so far a in januari presid bush submit a budget for 188 million in 1991 a reason amount of monei to begin the project plan for a mar mission hi intent wa to have govern find the right plan to move it forward it s import we appropri the fund in the 1991 budget without it we could see a reduct in resolv in the short term with it more compani could be brought in and we ar more like to find some solut q when would full scale work on contract begin given the 30 year plan a full scale design and develop would have to start around 1995 to meet the presid s expect we ar count on thi project as a major sourc of revenu in the late 1990s and after in 10 year space station freedom will be fly and we should be work veri hard on thi mar project q is there much prospect of a joint mission with the soviet a ye i think there will be an intern mission of some type we have the preced for it with the space station major portion of the space station ar be built in europ japan and canada it ha becom a learn experi for us as we think toward a mission to mar on reason it would be good is to share cost but an intern mission will also

have mani divers applic in the futur in the latest step announc todai univers of chicago scientist report that thei have produc the highest intens of sunlight found anywher in the solar system the advanc technolog could be us to rapidli send larg amount of data between orbit satellit to zap toxic substanc on earth with such intens that thei would be render harmless or even to melt the soil on the surfac of the moon for us in build land pad and radiat shelter the concentr of sunlight by the chicago team wa 15 higher than on the surfac of the sun we even beat the sun said physicist dave cook lead author of a report in todai s issu of the british scientif journal natur by us a small mirror and a collector that funnel sunlight into an intens beam the chicago team concentr sunlight to 84 000 time it normal intens on earth meanwhil team of research in california have built a huge solar collector that concentr sunlight so intens that if it were on the moon it could melt the soil on the lunar surfac laboratori experi show that the process would produc shini black glass that could be us to manufactur composit materi for construct project on the moon the giant collector which us 82 mirror of on squar meter each ha produc temperatur of 2 200 to 2 400 degre fahrenheit accord to engin with mcdonnel dougla space system co of huntington beach the collector wa built by the firm in the earli 1980s to us the sun s power to produc electr but it wa abandon when the price of oil plummet later that decad iron it ha been call back into servic at the height of anoth middl east crisi but for a veri differ reason engin with the firm have team up with alcoa gold worth engin of torranc and the space studi institut of princeton nj to see if the huge collector could be us to help astronaut build structur thei will need on the moon the idea is to learn more about design and applic to see if we can simplifi it said john garvei project manag at mcdonnel dougla garvei believ it might be possibl to build a solar collector that could be transport to the moon and us there to melt soil into fiber and glass brick that could be us in construct the beauti of thi is that all your materi is on the moon and that could reduc the need to transport construct materi from earth he said solar energi could be us more effici on the moon than on earth becaus the absenc of a lunar atmospher would allow 40 more sunlight to reach the collector the engin said and sinc there is no wind support facil could be much lighter than on earth the engin test their concept us simul lunar soil suppli by the princeton group when subject to intens heat it melt into glass garvei said sinc the temperatur were so high special crucibl to hold the molten glass were suppli by the torranc firm you could even make fork and spoon or almost anyth els the astronaut would need if you have the right mold to pour the glass into said engin mike magoffin the engin came up with the idea after presid bush call for build a perman station on the moon a feat that most expert believ can best be done if lunar materi ar us for much of the construct congress recent elimin fund from the current budget for the presid s space explor initi of which the lunar outpost is a part but the white hous is still push the project scientist at the univers of chicago ar more down to earth in their work but it is just about as far out unlik the huge mcdonnel dougla facil the chicago team us an ordinari telescop mirror of 16 inch diamet the parabol mirror reflect sunlight into a narrow beam that pass through a concentr which is just a funnel for light cook said dure a telephon interview the funnel which is a precis machin cone of pure sapphir bend the incom light rai as thei reflect off it side thu concentr it further sapphir wa pick becaus it ha a high refract index or abil to bend light that is so great that it doe not even have to be coat with a reflect materi the result is a highli effici solar collector accord to the univers of chicago s roland winston chairman of the physic depart who pioneer in the field last winter the research test their equip atop the physic build the solar collector gener 72 watt per squar millimet of surfac sunlight reach earth normal gener less than on thousandth of a watt per squar millimet cook said such an intens beam could be us as a solar pump laser thu gener a concentr beam of light that would be so power it could break down toxic wast in space the beam of light could be us as a carrier to transmit immens amount of data between commun satellit he ad the technolog could also be us to gener extrem high temperatur for process materi similar to what the southern california research have in mind for the surfac of the moon incident the technolog could also be us to gener electr thu eas demand for foreign oil the research said that idea wa abandon earlier when the price of oil drop but garvei said that concept could be resurrect
