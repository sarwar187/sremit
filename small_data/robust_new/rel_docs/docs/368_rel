decid what scientist shall do henc the latest alarm about egg farm and design babi but scientif breakthrough will themselv re defin social attitud for the next four month the british public is be invit to join an ethic debat about overcom the sever shortag of human egg for embryo research and the treatment of infertil women the human fertilis embryolog author a committe of expert and promin citizen want to know what the public think about take egg or ovarian tissu from corps and even when the procedur becom reliabl from abort foetus first reaction have been predict for a second opinion i went to see robert edward the cambridg professor who brought test tube babi into the world at the splendid jacobean hous outsid cambridg where he and patrick stepto found their clinic it ha taken the public 20 year to accept in vitro fertilis ivf and prof edward a distinguish scientist know all there is to know about controversi he ha even had to sue for libel he give the impress of on who is immun to critic but not to contradict yet from behind the set face and flat northern accent there gradual emerg a human and pleasant subtleti not surprisingli edward is a milit libertarian he seek the maximum possibl freedom for scientif inquiri and the minimum of statutori intervent into what he regard as a human endeavour to satisfi a fundament human desir which is to produc children i ask him how the latest outbreak compar with the test tube babi furor there have been endless controversi all of them headlin new thi is onli the latest but could i sai that we start the ethic debat in the whole field in 1971 he wa refer to an articl he wrote with david sharp an american academ lawyer for natur magazin there he call for elabor of the issu in order to give time for defin and evolv social attitud on which to base rule of conduct for scientist and societi some scientist i said argu their is a pure untrammel disciplin and it s not for them to take the ethic decis i ve never ever believ that i ve alwai said that in the earli stage of investig the crucial role ar plai by the scientist and doctor would you yourself us foetal ovari i would grow them at the present time to the stage befor fertilis he said i would want to know thei re perfectli normal befor i take ani further step that will probabl take year then i would probabl fertilis some and grow them as embryo i would not transfer them into the surrog mother becaus there could be consider social backlash to thi work in ani ethic debat on must alwai put down a period of two to three year for social balanc to be establish the effect of mani scientif develop on societi come as a shock the yuk factor or whatev you call it would you treat singl women i would ye provid thei had ethic counsel and there wa detail ethic investig of their background patient usual came on referr their background known but he recal that on would be patient turn out to be a lesbian should there be an ag limit prof edward quot the biblic stori of sarah and observ that the oldest artifici pregnanc to date wa of a woman of 61 or 62 between 50 and 60 the medic risk to mother and child ar no greater than those of a younger woman with proper care had there been medic or scientif contra indic i would have said thi is out but i have not seen those contra indic it ha move from be a scientif question to a social on and i feel veri strongli that individu liberti here ar be threaten i see no reason why a woman of 60 should not have a babi i don t know if i would go to 70 or not i alwai sai ask the question when you know the work can be done should peopl be abl to choos the babi s colour if thei sai thei do not let the colour of skin affect their relationship with anybodi that thei ar non racist then you should not mind if a white ladi wish to have a black babi can t you see ani ethic object not realli if two white patient come and ask for a black babi i would wonder about that but if it s a white man and black woman as it usual is and the colour of the child is veri obvious go to be a problem then provid thei were counsel i would sai veri well what about choos sex again i think i must be veri liber i do not see ani great danger in choos the sex of your children provid certain control ar exercis the most seriou thing that can happen is that you will get an imbal of sex as in china but the most interest aspect which is never discuss is what the children would sai and feel if thei knew thei had been chosen as boi or girl by their parent edward himself is the father of five girl of whom two ar non ident twin he would not howev seek to creat twin to order we discuss the problem of medic consent and i ask him whether paradox as it might sound a child could have right even befor it concept i am increasingli think so it is quit clear in american law and increasingli in british law that the foetu ha right these right matur at birth he explain and children had been abl to sue for damag in utero even for wrong birth if thei emerg grossli abnorm do women have a right to bear their own children the right to have a babi is not absolut there ar no absolut but i think the transmiss of gener is on of the most fundament area of human activ our notion of right and duti ha come from the judaeo christian tradit but in todai s secular societi it is frame ultim by parliament edward said he had been impress by the sophist of debat especi in the hous of lord i think our democraci doe give us the basi for open and fair discuss we have to toler the newspap headlin and the pressur and that by the wai is incred difficult and exhaust ing but if you enter a field like thi it is part of what you must expect you can no longer work in isol in the laboratori you must accept the implic of your own decis and defend them it is veri wise to take advic from the ethic committe as soon as possibl have you been accus of bend your ethic to suit your profess as far as i know the opinion i gave in 1971 and after have not chang at all on alwai fear be stuck close to a field all on s life that you start make decis that aren t be examin critic enough you can get veri introvert so i m delight to see the recent debat i ask him to name the thing he would never do clone wa on by clone he mean not egg split but replic an exist or deceas person i ve never met anyon in the world who is worth clone and that s been my stock answer for 10 year anoth wa implant human embryo in anim he would also be veri wari of genet type foetus if that meant them be mark down for abort better he said to interven and attempt to cure the genet abnorm i think all of us ar strive to improv life not to do down life there s a natur tendenc for mani peopl to sai no becaus thei ve grown up in a certain set of circumst but what amaz me is the intellig of the ordinari citizen when it is explain clearli thei can then ask the same question we ask we ar interf with natur alreadi i said final is there some philosoph absolut here which we call the human be which should not be further penetr by medic scienc we re nowher near that point yet if there is a point nowher near the colour of skin is about the onli characterist you could usefulli select all the other thing about brain intellig these won t come through molecular biologi i don t think the thing we can do at the moment ar enough to make us challeng the deep concept of the human becaus the interfer is so minim unfortun man ha mani defici diseas and disord that in my view do not enhanc the valu of man we have to come to the idea that we mai be abl to us all our knowledg to make man a littl better to avoid diseas or to confer abil but my word that s when the philosoph discuss will realli start that question will come when we have learn two fundament step how to put gene into embryo and how to tell exactli what those gene will do and i would sai that is probabl 100 year awai a lifetim anywai

ago the dilemma doctor like k tabsh now face daili ar inextric link to abort prenat diagnosi after all is the onli type of medic diagnosi in which a possibl result is intent death for that reason abort is a central issu but tabsh adamantli downplai it signific the aim of prenat diagnosi is not abort he sai the aim is diagnos malform and abnorm so patient can be prepar for a bad outcom psycholog and physic decid what to do in the case of a bad outcom is never easi though some case ar more clear cut than other sure candid for abort ar the most sever abnorm such as anencephali or the disastr inherit metabol and chromosom diseas such as tai sach diseas and trisomi 13 and 18 in which an extra chromosom produc sever retard and babi who frequent don t live longer than on year but becaus prenat screen cannot predict the sever of a defect such as down s syndrom mani coupl ar thrown into a moral quagmir some children with down s lead fairli normal happi live and some suffer a lifetim of chronic disabl creat enorm hardship on their famili when face with a diagnosi of down s 91 of coupl in california elect abort accord to the most recent data compil by the state depart of health servic tabsh s posit on abort is clear it is a patient s right to decid but sometim that rhetor give wai to hi feel about the grim realiti of second trimest abort when you do a d and e dilat and elimin it s a gross procedur he sai you grab the babi and pull the babi out you re pull arm and leg the babi come out in piec it s a sicken procedur person he doe not perform abort as part of hi practic except for select termin of multipl pregnanc which usual involv far less develop fetus he distinguish the two type of abort sai second trimest procedur ar us to end an unwant pregnanc wherea hi select termin ar save a desper want infant but what of the patient who simpli doesn t want to carri twin or a coupl that decid to termin a triplet base on sex hi own ethic dictat that he will not reveal the sex of a fetu nor reduc healthi twin to singleton and like other doctor perform pregnanc reduct he leav the woman with twin whenev possibl he sai he doe it partli becaus it leav a margin for error and partli becaus he want to save everi normal fetu that he can triplet pregnanc ar in a grai area becaus medic data is scant tabsh ha deliv some healthi triplet but ha also seen mani suffer from prematur final the patient and her famili must decid whether to choos abort he sai i don t decid these thing he explain if it were up to me i d probabl decid against it i m just a technician tabsh follow on other ground rule befor perform the procedur at northridg hospit a ucla affili hospit he ha taken the unpreced step of insist that patient meet with the hospit ethic committe to ensur a fulli inform consent the first doctor who perform select termin did so dure the second trimest to abort on of a pair of fetal twin afflict with down s syndrom now the stake ar chang when the

lab test reveal that the abort triplet had down s syndrom it could have gone the other wai i m sure on dai somebodi s go to termin a normal babi and leav an abnorm on behind tabsh sai it s on of the

debbi embre 33 a former patient of tabsh s who help creat a support group for patient face such decis wa carri twin when tabsh discov that on of them wa suffer from hydrocephalu at 23 week if the

legal cutoff for an abort wa dai awai and she and her husband had to decid over the weekend whether to agre to a select termin we said to dr tabsh help us decid she recal he said you and your husband
