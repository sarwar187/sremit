anxieti to present thi video along with hi person opinion howev i could care less whether or not he present these video clip i believ it is advis for panama to know the truth rather than hide the truth about what happen dr escalona said thi here and i wa at santa ana squar on 10 mai when those digniti battalion member attack presid endara ford ricardo aria calderon and myself thei gang up on us and beat us with cudgel while the panamanian guard or armi look on i certainli believ it is advis to present the truth the truth is never bad the truth will alwai prevail sooner or later thi is not an appeal for violenc thi is an appeal for harmoni it is an appeal for justic we must recogn our sin in panama and strive to rebuild our countri let us defend our democraci justic and liberti let us

samaniego thank you dear viewer we will now hear the opinion and question from some of the young peopl who accompani us tonight on youth 94 unidentifi student thank you to begin with i have an opinion about what we have just seen i believ politician ar alwai talk but the situat is differ for our peopl i think the peopl hope these elect were the begin of a work program by all polit group right thi is where my question come in what would be the justic and peac commiss s role after listen to these videocassett the question is for all of the candid samaniego dr manfredo can we start with you manfredo i would rather have on of my comrad go first samaniego dr escalona escalona with pleasur the justic and peac commiss s role until now ha been to prevent violenc it ha been approach by those of us who ar known as politician but you must rememb that we ar all politician man is a polit anim plato ha describ man and i repeat thi as a polit anim becaus we all carri the old citi in our heart the old citi is the homeland we all have the homeland in our heart and therefor if we talk about the homeland we talk about polit consequ the express that you the politician and we name the on who ar not politician is a form of particip in polit sentenc as heard i do not believ in those thing i believ all citizen ar politician and each occupi hi place whether on a larger or smaller scale accord to hi activ and accord to the posit he want to occupi in the futur he doe thi to fulfil hi polit role within the citi or within the countri thi compel us to establish the appropri norm for a better lifestyl refer to the question it is veri specif should the presid of the republ have present these videotap ye a thousand time ye and again i refer to my knowledg about human thi is part of the republ s histori thi cannot be deni we have live through thi thi is part of our heritag we should not hide thi becaus for better or wors it is the histori of the republ and it should be brought out in the open whoever doe not want to learn from histori is bound to make the same mistak becaus histori help inspir us and prevent us from fall for the same caus and under the same condit consequ i believ that if the presid of the republ learn about these videotap he did the right thing when he present them to the panamanian peopl thi is our histori and we cannot forget it becaus thi is what happen it is all there and it should not onli be reveal but also repeat so that all the panamanian mai know we live those year under these harsh and difficult condit those year cannot be repeat if we truli want to forg ahead samaniego thank you dr escalona we have anoth question from the young peopl in attend unidentifi student i want to know if it doe the countri ani good for the presid to have releas the videotap to the public on the verg of elect when he had four year of govern to do so samaniego mr manfredo manfredo in fact that is my question why now i am not question whether citizen should be inform of the inner go on of the noriega govern the noriega regim the question i ask myself is thi if thi ha been avail for some time why releas it now thi rais a seri of doubt and suspicion regard the presid s imparti samaniego engin guerra do you have ani respons to thi question guerra ye i believ the presid s assert that he ha had thi inform for just a coupl of dai which perhap some citizen mai doubt now regardless of thi i believ that the inform had to be releas why becaus the impress given is that everyth is fine everyth is normal and thi is not the case i believ that in fact thi video show what the true intent is of the parti that current head the poll and where ar we head i believ we need to be veri care samaniego dr escalona escalona precis the student s question focus on time he ask whether the time is right for the presid to have present thi video each man s action ar hi own respons thi is a privat action by the civilian presid of the republ who ha explain veri well that when he receiv these videocassett he had to make a decis at thi time he had to make thi decis i must confess young student that i feel veri satisfi of have learn about thi video at the right time i am veri grate that it wa shown to me at thi time becaus i wa abl to see how the octopu work from insid i onli knew of the action from the outsid action that deni my son s freedom action that struck me in the street action that broke my car s windshield action that endang the veri exist of all citizen what i did not know wa the cynic that these videocassett show it is well worth know thi how a 52 million dam wa turn into a monei scandal sole and exclus to keep the octopu go mani thank samaniego engin quijano quijano i must accept the presid s word that he knew about thi video onli a few dai ago he made the decis and it wa hi veri own decis regard public affair i believ each man s or each women s privat life is inde privat howev the public life of the public offici is public the public life of the public man i wa a minist for two and on half year should be an open book that enabl citizen to read it investig it and analyz it quijano all of us adult here experienc the dictatorship we knew what wa happen in the street what we never imagin wa the extent of the manipul take place within the presid how thei plai with the figur how thei manipul the number of vote how thei would plai around with the peopl s wellb there wa even mention of specif name of individu and union leader who dare to sai if the presid of the republ doe not behav he would be taught a lesson that mean mani thing such as an indiffer to the individu self esteem in thi respect i do believ it should have been said when he said he had first found out about the video samaniego thank you mr quijano anoth question from the young voter unidentifi student i am a student at el istmo univers we have just seen what wa broadcast via televis and we all agre we should never return to that past my question is consid the result of the public opinion poll and the prd approv rate would you all be will to unit and form a common front divorc of all selfish in order to reach the presid quijano i believ your question is quit valid i believ the group which support civilian rule in panama repres an absolut major compar to the militarist these ar the two trend now my person opinion is that we pro civilian rule support must set asid our polit ambit to ensur a solid uniti which will benefit the lower incom group the young man here just point out all of thi is in the past that is correct it is the past the peopl want solut to their problem concret program that will resolv issu such as educ health public servic and employ the peopl do not want program that ar a mere demagogueri the peopl want real and effect program i believ we must set asid our person and polit ambit if we expect to ensur uniti and thu forg ahead samaniego mr manfredo would you like to sai someth manfredo i believ the opportun wa lost when the polit parti instead of attempt to ensur some degre of uniti against a situat such as the on you mention or some uniti in prepar a program gave a sorri spectacl of polit parti by split up the booti allianc were made base on who would get the presid the vice presid ministri autonom agenc embassi and so forth that mere result in total discredit the polit group that becam involv in these negoti that is why our parti decid to remain on the sidelin becaus we were unwil to get into that game of monopoli in other word i will give you a vice presid if you give me two ministri i will give you two ministri and you give me an embassi samaniego mr escalona as part of the govern allianc you particip in some of these negoti wa that the wai thing were done escalona i can sincer sai onli someon who ignor panama s polit situat can speak in such a wai such a person ha no idea whatsoev of how allianc were made allianc ar over and abov that minuscul world which onli an imagin such as your can think up allianc were not establish for those reason i would like to state the follow on two occas presidenti candid mireya moscoso de gruber ha cite the need for the group which support civilian rule to unit we have not receiv ani similar repli from other parti to thi same call we made thi call on two occas our parti doe not want to give those peopl we just saw on the video anoth opportun for them to repeat anoth dark period in thi countri s histori just look at what thei intend to do thei just want to return to repeat everyth over again thi is the onli thing toro prd presidenti candid ernesto perez balladar can promis that group which will ensur their return to power there will be no other opportun thei plan to repeat everyth over again thank you veri much samaniego mr guerra guerra thank you i must disagre with fernando manfredo with respect to the manner in which the allianc were negoti first of all i wa abl to wit the mani time we attempt to alli or find some agreement with the member of the papa egoro movement mpe thei alwai said thei want to go out on their own that thei were differ in thi respect the search for uniti wa never their object thei simpli believ that thei ar holder of an absolut truth and in thi respect we disagre the other inaccuraci be dissemin here is that everyon is conduct himself as if toro balladar is alreadi the winner allow me to sai that in the two previou elect the same poll also conced up to 35 percentag point to the govern the end result wa quit differ becaus thei had to resort to elect fraud and the cancel of the elect in order to win the onli thing i can sai to the panamanian peopl is first of all those of you who were plan to vote for the prd for on moment just think about what you just saw cast your vote accord to your conscienc those of you who ar allow yourselv to be influenc by the poll simpli vote accord to your conscienc on 8 mai and elect a differ govern samaniego we will continu with anoth question quijano i believ mr manfredo made some comment with respect to divvi up the cake i believ that we were all abl to see in thi video who were the on divid up the cake and we could see thi through the word of those govern offici in offic at the time howev accord to their own statement thei start to divid the cake as far back as 1968 and continu to do so until 1989 from 1968 to 1977 there were no polit parti in panama becaus the dictatorship had outlaw them we were live in a polit dark ag at that time the cake wa be divid becaus there were no legislatur no code no public bid to purchas sugar mill or cement plant and no quota there wa absolut noth everyth wa done through omar torrijo the gener who follow and the minist who follow them samaniego mr manfredo is entitl to repli manfredo ye i will be veri brief the allianc s negoti with our parti all featur the condit that we should conced the leadership to other we insist the allianc could onli be base on concret program and guerra interrupt i must complet disagre with that becaus it is simpli not correct definit the issu now is not what took place the young man just ask a veri real question ar we will to reach an agreement the answer in our case is ye we ar will to reach a nation agreement why becaus over and abov parti interest and individu interest there is the interest of what the countri is go to do dure these next five 10 and 25 year that is the repli we the nation uniti movement mun ar give the panamanian peopl samaniego we welcom mr ossa the christian democrat parti s vice presidenti candid who is join our group mr ossa can you briefli give us your opinion on what you just saw over the televis ossa congratul to the student of the school of public administr for thi opportun tonight we the panamanian peopl watch video footag that make us rememb thing we do not want to happen again human be rememb but thei ar like to forget about past event or experi and repeat mistak it is fair for us to recal our neg experi so thei ar not repeat i think it is worthwhil to rememb these thing and there ar still mani more thing to rememb samaniego anoth question by a young man unidentifi student dr escalona you speak of public the mainland s histori why did the govern censur the video on the invas of panama consid it won an oscar escalona as far as i know the govern ha not censur ani video there have been remark on it i watch the video and what it show is a long wai from what realli happen in panama the video partial show certain thing from a particular viewpoint to the extent i am convinc someon paid for the video to be manufactur like that samaniego we will continu with more question here is a student who a few moment ago ask to particip unidentifi student good even dr escalona do you think the video the presid ha just air will in ani wai help reinforc your slate and weaken the prd the prd lead in all the opinion poll while your slate is third escalona that is probabl why the video wa air i cannot tell you for sure i am sure howev it ha help me as i said befor to becom thoroughli familiar with the movement of the octopu i wa awar of the militari s will to defend their govern i knew of some of the thing that were shown but i wa unawar of the callous with which thei talk about their so call duti to beat the panamanian peopl to weaken a labor leader these thing have been educ for me student the arnulfist parti is in power but the panamanian peopl ar cry prd everywher mean peopl ar not satisfi with the current govern which ha not given us what we want and ask for when we demand a chang the fact thi video ha been present by the presid who also belong to the arnulfist parti make us think escalona these ar everyon s opinion and specul you have everi right to express an opinion and make specul mai i reiter thi could be the purpos of the presid show or not show the video i dare not sai what motiv him i do dare sai howev it ha been educ for me to have learn about thi under ani circumst todai tomorrow or after the elect i know the movement of the octopu from insid out these movement and what move them ar thoroughli detail there thei want to stai in power to retain the privileg thei had alreadi acquir samaniego mr manfredo on repli to thi remark manfredo we will win on 8 mai not with the vote against the prd but with the vote in favor of our propos samaniego anoth question by anoth student unidentifi student my question is thi the video the presid ha present is just a reaction of fear of see the prd as a leader of fear the govern parti will win the next elect do you think thi is a sign of agoni on hi part samaniego mr ossa your opinion ossa my attent ha been drawn to the wai he critic the presid s action by describ it as an agoni and he is not far from the truth when he mention the announc the presid said he wa ill in the head and the heart i think the presid ha creat an unnecessari expect throughout the countri becaus we all were familiar with 75 percent of the inform includ in the video i rememb have heard soli palma sai over the televis five year ago the minist gave credit more to the defens forc than anyon els and everyon knew thi in panama but he is refresh our memori thi workshop deal with the state s dynam regard global and the chang necessari in the state thi is on of the necessari chang and thi is why thi must not happen in panama again but it will like happen samaniego anoth question unidentifi student on of the candid mention histori i have alwai like histori my question is address to mr escalona i would like for him to rememb two date i have never forgotten 2 januari 1931 and 20 decemb 1989 i would like him to give us an opinion at the same time the presid s remark give me the impress he is try to pass judgment not a formal on but a nationwid on where the govern is the judg the peopl the juri and the prd the accus i would like for you to give me your opinion escalona three posit for three entir differ perspect first januari of 1931 wa the first coup in the histori of the republ histori sai thi coup wa aim at goytia he could not handl it at the time and sought the help of harmodio aria thi coup chang the countri s destini and a new leadership emerg becaus dr arnulfo aria madrid wa born then and there i rememb thi veri well becaus thi is part of our histori and part of the panamanian peopl s cultur you rememb thing well second what happen on 19 decemb 1989 on that dai the north american forc rain death over the countri some call it invas other call it liber the result of thi is that the panamanian peopl welcom the north american who came not to overthrow a govern and thi is where the histor analysi is wrong but to defend democraci respond to a govern decis to annul the elect when the govern made thi decis and the oa back the govern the unit state came up with oper just caus and came to panama to defend democraci samaniego there is a question left unansw from on of the student particip in youth 94 concern the video the presid of the republ just present unidentifi student i comment in my last question that when the presid s video wa be broadcast it gave the impress of be a public trial on a nation level here as i mention befor the govern is the judg the accus in thi case would be the prd and the juri would be the panamanian peopl if a legal expert can give me a repli base on escalona interrupt i believ i have the right to respond to thi question and i will exercis that right the question is whether thi is a trial by juri or whether thi is a trial by magistr here is panama we do not have the type of trial in which both magistr and juror particip as far as i know thi onli exist in itali thi formula is us to enabl the magistr to compens for error the juri might commit there is inde a victim here as you have adeptli point out the analog is wrong howev in term of the victim the onli victim here is the panamanian peopl thei ar the victim those good for noth were feast on and celebr what thei were take from the panamanian peopl what thei were milk from the panamanian peopl you saw for yourself sit there you can see everyon from the presid of the republ to the command of the nation guard everi singl minist of state and everi singl deputi minist of state i saw targidio bernal among them and he wa onli a deputi govern minist thei were feast thi wa a demonstr of what thei did to remain in govern their idea wa that the most import thing for a govern wa to make sure that it wa not overthrown thei do not want to be overthrown even if thei ar overthrown by wai of vote but thi time we must overthrow them thank you samaniego mr ossa as a lawyer what is your analysi ossa in my opinion the student s percept is excel when he us the analog of a trial i also agre with escalona that the victim ha been the peopl he mention the plaintiff the defend and the juri howev he did not includ the victim accord to the video the peopl were the victim and accord to the current situat the peopl continu to be the victim thing have not chang i would like to advis my colleagu escalona to be care when he talk about those good for noth becaus he could be speak of some peopl still in govern if you like i can mention some name escalona go ahead mention them ossa the presid s advis menalco soli for exampl escalona go ahead mention them we ar here to ossa interrupt you here can help me mention some name right samaniego no you mention them ossa i can mention for exampl menalco soli who work directli with escalona interrupt go ahead mention them we ar ossa interrupt do not call him a good for noth becaus thi could offend him mayb thi would be a situat paus mayb the peopl would escalona interrupt i think it is your duti to mention these name ossa i think the figur of speech is correct and the applic of the term good for noth wa correct mayb legisl escalona is right after all samaniego doe mr manfredo have someth to sai manfredo i agre with my colleagu here laughter applaus samaniego let us continu with more question for the vice presidenti candid on the current situat in the countri follow the video present by presid endara unidentifi student i believ we have discuss the video on the previou govern but none of the panelist have told us what their plan ar for area such as health hous educ samaniego interrupt we ar go to discuss thi in a moment howev if you wish thei can briefli answer your question unidentifi student i would like that becaus we have discuss the video but thei have not disclos ani plan or ani solut for hous health and educ we do not onli want

brief comment on that i agre that without forget the past and without try to reclaim the past we must begin look ahead to the futur samaniego of cours mr ossa mr quijano pardon me quijano i believ it is a veri time question we have not address these issu becaus thei have not been rais dure the commerci break by the wai i wonder aloud when the young peopl would ask about program for the futur becaus we must think of the futur briefli in the area of educ i believ we should elimin all remnant of statism from the nation constitut and open our border to nation and foreign univers to enabl panamanian to have the abil and facil to educ themselv properli and adequ the state must strengthen higher educ and provid the necessari financ so that young student whose sole problem is monei can receiv an adequ educ and in turn be prepar for the futur samaniego engin quijano forgiv me for interrupt you but thi topic will be discuss after we present the prd new confer we would like to wind up

prd just held to discuss presid guillermo endara s remark on a nationwid televis network passag omit samaniego now we ar go to hear the reaction of each of the candid mr ossa what is your reaction to the new confer the prd presidenti candid ha just given ossa i notic candid perez balladar reaction on the tv screen when he said he feel asham that the presid rememb the past and everyth els i do not know whether the presid did the right thing i truli believ we need to rememb thing but i look up the definit of the word toro in the royal academi s dictionari and it sai it is a tough skin mammal with a long tail i guess it is true that on need to be tough skin to go befor the countri and sai it is not good to recal the past when on ha serv as manag for carlo duqu s 1989 campaign i believ we need to rememb thi too and if a person ha a long tail he should try to discourag peopl from recal the past i think the presid s decis to show the video wa good becaus it prod the memori and the prd ha no other option other than to sai it wa not good to have shown it i simpli believ that it wa good to have shown it samaniego viewer and special guest we will now go to our studio on the transisthmian highwai for more reaction after that we will return to youth 94 passag omit viewer and friend we ar back with youth 94 we will now hear more reaction on how the candid and the peopl feel about presid guillermo endara s messag video cut to live relai of an interview with samuel lewi galindo nation consensu allianc presidenti candid by an unidentifi report report thank you ricardo we ar here at la roca build to hear what samuel lewi galindo presidenti candid for the nation consensu allianc ha to sai about presid endara s messag lewi he present a documentari that depict shame event and most of the panamanian peopl condemn these event when thei occur it is becaus of those thing that happen and also becaus of so mani subservi civilian that parti such as solidar were born thei were born from the need to give the peopl a chang a real chang from that ignomini past and from todai which is full of frustrat todai more than ever i believ that solidar is fulfil a great duti it is rais polit to a high level and it is give polit the digniti it should have and that the panamanian peopl deserv report what do you think wa behind the presid s decis to make thi video public lewi i believ that the presid of the republ should not have been the on to present a strictli polit documentari that should have been done by on of the parti that oppos the prd to remind the peopl about incid which have been condemn by everyon and which were a shame for the nation video return to samaniego at the el panama hotel who introduc a three minut record of a 14 april new confer by pdc presidenti candid eduardo vallarino passag omit samaniego mr ossa ha alreadi given hi view about the prd candid s statement we will now ask hi opinion about the variou reaction throughout the countri ossa i simpli want to sai in 30 second that the most import thing which occur in mr perez balladar statement is that he did not deni what appear in the video although he did beat around the bush he mere discuss whether the presid had done the right thing or not he did not deni the most import issu in thi case silenc can be taken for consent samaniego dr manfredo manfredo i said at the outset of thi program that i believ it wa inappropri for the presid to person present the videotap but i wa equal surpris by ernesto perez balladar appear on televis becaus he is the candid of the prd which support noriega s regim i would have thought that after view the videotap he would be hide in a closet beat hi chest and sai mea culpa mea culpa mea gravissima culpa laughter samaniego engin guerra politician or politico gener us word when thei ar conveni thei talk about feel asham about the presid s attitud but thei have never talk about feel asham about the attitud thei adopt dure the 21 year regim the other thing is that he is issu an appeal for democraci todai when for 21 year he person abet dictatorship in thi nation those ar incongru thing and i believ the essenti thing is he cannot deni thi it would be barbar becaus it is there on video he would have to claim he is not the on shown on the screen although he doe not realli resembl the man shown on the screen escalona the scriptur sai thei shall be known for their deed candid ernesto perez balladar ha shown todai what he truli is he ha sought refug in escap he ha critic the presid of the republ to avoid a problem which he know he wa a part of thei shall be known for their deed he ha no other option but to do what the holi scriptur sai and hear me well ernesto perez balladar tie a millston around your neck and jump into the ocean
