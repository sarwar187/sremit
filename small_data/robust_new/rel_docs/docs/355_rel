rang process azimuth process motion compens and multi look process of which the most difficult problem ar azimuth process and motion compens in thi paper a method of digit imag us spaceborn sar is present the effect of thi method is demonstr by the high resolut imag gener us raw radar data collect by the us seasat a satellit ii mathemat model of the radar signal the radar transmit a linear frequenc modul fm puls signal let d be the puls width t be the puls repetit period r t be the slant rang between the satellit and the ground target w sup a t be the azimuth direct function of the antenna s x r be the scatter coeffici of the ground target a t be a step function of width d l be the wavelength and c be the speed of light then the radar return signal can be express as sup 1 s x r s x r w sup r r h sub 1 x r sup r h sub 2 x r 1 where w sup r r is the rang direct function of the antenna is the two dimension convolut with respect to azimuth x and rang r sup r is the on dimension convolut with respect to rang r also in the abov equat f sup d is the doppler center frequenc f sup r is the rate of chang of doppler frequenc v is the satellit veloc rel to the ground and b is the frequenc modul rate on can see from the radar signal model that the radar return is a complic two dimension convolut the purpos of signal process is to extract the scatter characterist of the target from the receiv signal and ultim to form a high qualiti radar imag iii rang compress process rang process of spaceborn sar actual impli puls compress digit puls compress in the rang direct us fft for match filter implement the process signal can be express as where c sup 0 2 b d c it is known from the principl of puls compress that the slant rang resolut after puls compress is r sup r c 2b sub r and the ground rang resolut is where b sup r is the signal bandwidth h is the satellit altitud r sup e is the mean earth radiu and th is the antenna view angl the number of sampl of the rang refer function is where f sup s is the sampl frequenc the raw data collect by seasat a ar digit data produc by the a d convert prior to rang process thei must first be orthogon and then match filter the orthogon process is accomplish in the frequenc domain where a window function is appli and the signal carrier frequenc is shift to zero frequenc final a complex ifft invers fast fourier transform is perform to complet the process of rang digit puls compress thi process is equival to a transform from real data to complex data the complex data ar store for azimuth process iv azimuth compress process the azimuth refer function is chosen base on the express of the rang compress radar signal sup 2 due to the effect of rang drift coupl between the rang direct and the azimuth direct exist in the radar return therefor azimuth process requir complic two dimension process in fact azimuth process is actual a two dimension match filter the filter output signal repres the scatter characterist of the ground target which is of the form s sup 0 x r s sub r x r h sup sup a x r 8 the implement of two dimension match filter for azimuth process is highli comput intens by us a hybrid time domain and frequenc domain correl techniqu the two dimension problem reduc to a on dimension problem and the correct of rang drift can be accomplish in the frequenc domain as a result the amount of comput is greatli reduc for a second order curv r x the azimuth refer function for rang r sup 0 is where d sup i is the distanc of the rang refer valu r sup 0 and the express in the frequenc domain after azimuth process is of the form it can be seen from the abov express that the hybrid correl method us time domain correl in the rang direct and frequenc domain correl in the azimuth direct thi approach take full advantag of the fft and therefor provid an effici wai of calcul precis impuls respons if the abov method is appli directli for azimuth compress the amount of comput will increas with increas doppler center frequenc a more effici wai would be to appli correct to the rang wander the linear term of rang drift befor azimuth puls compress then appli correct to the rang bend the second order term of rang drift in the frequenc domain thi approach requir less comput and r x in the azimuth refer function g sup i x r sub 0 becom comput result show that the digit imag of spaceborn sar produc by thi method and the previou method ar almost ident but the amount of comput for azimuth compress at f sup d 980 hz is reduc by on half v motion compens becaus of antenna point error and error caus by satellit motion it is difficult to accur estim the doppler center frequenc and the rate of chang of doppler frequenc from satellit histor data and from sar paramet inaccuraci in the doppler center frequenc and in the rate of chang of doppler frequenc will have an advers effect on sar imag inaccuraci in the doppler center frequenc will result in lower signal to nois ratio which in turn will caus an increas in the fuzzi in azimuth and a shift in the target posit inaccuraci in the rate of chang of doppler frequenc will caus defocus in the radar imag and result in a decreas in pixel resolut an effect method of estim the doppler paramet is to estim the error in the doppler paramet directli from the radar return data the clutter lock us for estim the error in the doppler center frequenc is

by the tiro noaa satellit and the goe famili of weather satellit in the earli 1980s china began receiv data from the tiro noaa satellit and the gm satellit and in the mid 1980s the data were first us in marin applic therefor china is 20 year behind the unit state and western europ in term of receiv and appli data from weather satellit nevertheless signific progress had been made within the past 10 year and china s current technolog ha reach a level compar to that of advanc nation but in the area of global weather monitor and ocean monitor littl progress can be made until china launch it own satellit china s first experiment weather satellit the feng yun 1a wa launch in septemb 1988 again 20 year behind the first tiro noaa satellit further effort is requir to improv it oper life and storag capac in juli 1972 the unit state launch the first land monitor satellit the landsat 1 in 1986 china began receiv remot sens data from landsat 4 launch on 16 juli 1982 and ha continu to receiv data for the past six year data from landsat have gener excel result in the survei of land resourc but thei have not contribut a great deal to the import aspect of oceanographi map of the coastal belt and offshor island in februari 1992 japan launch it own landsat which is equip with an l band synthet apertur radar in addit to a multi band scan radiomet it ha a ground resolut of 18 m x 18 m and ha larg onboard storag capac therefor the japanes landsat is a satellit with full durat all weather global monitor capabl the first chines landsat is current under develop it probabl will not be launch until after 1994 it detector ar similar to those us on the us landsat 5 in other word the technolog us on the chines landsat is also 20 year behind in june 1978 the unit state launch the world s first integr marin observ satellit the seasat a it is equip with five detector four of which ar microwav detector and on is a visibl light infrar radiomet thi satellit oper continu for over 100 dai dure which time it collect variou data on ocean wave field wind field current field intern wave boundari between land and water terrain of shallow sea ic distribut oil pollut and terrain of the ocean surfac analysi of the data by scientist in the intern commun show that the detector onboard the seasat a ar primarili us to monitor the ocean s dynam phenomena improv version of the seasat a detector have been implement on the er 1 satellit which wa launch by the european space agenc esa in juli 1991 thei ar design to monitor ic condit in the ocean china current doe not have the technolog matur to launch it own marin satellit the microwav detector requir for marin applic ar still in the experiment stage also there is a lack of comprehens research effort to develop microwav remot sensor for marin applic in octob 1978 the unit state launch the world s first ocean color monitor satellit the nimbu 7 it wa equip with a multi channel microwav radiomet and a coastal zone color scanner czc dure 10 year of oper 1978 1988 particularli the first five year it had collect on third of the global data on ocean color ocean surfac temperatur and wind veloc in addit the unit state is plan to launch anoth ocean color monitor satellit the seastar it onboard seawif detector with eight visibl light band ar expect to provid better perform than the czc in china there ar no immedi plan for launch ocean color monitor satellit iv china s goal for the develop of satellit remot sens for marin applic in thi centuri satellit remot sens technolog for marin applic in china todai is approxim 20 25 year behind the state of the art in order to acceler the pace of develop and to narrow the technolog gap we should concentr our effort on the develop of integr techniqu for appli remot sens data in oceanographi we should also emphas the systemat develop of variou technolog associ with satellit remot sens particularli detector technolog in order to build a good technic foundat in prepar for the launch of china s own marin satellit earli next centuri 1 establish ground system for receiv and process satellit remot sens data the plan is to extend the capabl of exist ground station to receiv data from the er 1 satellit the jer 1 satellit launch by japan in februari 1992 the er 2 satellit a follow on satellit to er 1 schedul to be launch at the end of 1994 the radarsat to be launch by canada in 1994 and three other polar orbit satellit the unit state western europ and japan each plan to launch on satellit after 1997 dure the 1990s when china s own satellit remot sens technolog is still in the earli stage of develop the most cost effect approach would be to make us of the remot sens data collect by foreign satellit such data will be us to meet the grow domest need in ocean petroleum develop marin product marin engin ocean transport disast prevent ocean explor ocean manag and militari applic thi will also provid an opportun to accumul a knowledg base in appli microwav remot sens data and to build a solid technic foundat for launch our own marin satellit the establish of such system will enhanc china s posit in the intern commun of remot sens for marin applic 2 establish of ground system for receiv and process data from ocean color monitor satellit by upgrad exist ground station of the weather satellit oper by the nation bureau of oceanographi we will be abl to receiv data from foreign ocean color monitor satellit e g the seastar and the adeo in view of the fact that china will not have it own ocean color satellit dure the 1990s share data from other countri appear to be a viabl approach the seastar and the adeo satellit ar expect to continu oper until the end of thi centuri thei will be abl to provid data on chlorophyl concentr in the ocean suspend mud and sand content and partial assess of water qualiti such data ar import for the develop and mainten of fish and cultiv zone the construct of harbor and ship lane and the develop and util of beach front area 3 promot basic research of marin satellit technolog the topic of basic research should includ variou type of microwav detector such as synthet apertur radar radar altimet microwav scatter meter microwav radiomet water color detector and laser fluoresc detector precis orbit determin techniqu and precis measur techniqu
