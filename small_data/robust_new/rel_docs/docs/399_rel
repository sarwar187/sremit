yuanwang 2 on research vessel xiangyanghong 10 and three each of rescu vessel tug and suppli ship a total of 12 ship of five differ model were built the survei vessel were china s first gener of ocean survei and track station the other ship were also china s first gener ocean instrument vessel their overal perform and major equip were the most advanc in china at the time the establish of the ocean instrument fleet made china the fourth countri in the world after the unit state the soviet union and franc to have an ocean survei and track capabl it form a land sea commun network for measur and monitor and provid a good track and monitor system for the develop of the three high prioriti mission and other aerospac flight test it ha contribut to china s develop of it frontier defens technolog 6 develop of nuclear power missil submarin base on the decis of the central special committe to first develop the nuclear torpedo submarin and then develop the guid missil submarin the studi of the overal design for the guid missil submarin and submarin to land missil system began shortli after initi result were obtain in the nuclear torpedo submarin project in 1969 the state plan commiss the offic of defens industri and the defens scienc commiss made some specif assign for the guid missil submarin project the seventh academi wa assign to develop the missil bai and the launch devic the second ministri of machin build wa pick to design and build the nuclear power devic and the seventh ministri of machin build wa given the task of develop the submarin to land guid missil other particip in the submarin weapon system develop includ the first and fourth ministri of machin build 15 other depart and institut 24 provinc and municip and some 2 000 plant and research laboratori in 1970 the construct of the first guid missil nuclear submarin began but wa hamper by the great cultur revolut in addit becaus of the high degre of technic difficulti in develop the submarin to land guid missil and the launch system there were mani technic obstacl and progress wa slow in 1977 after reorgan the develop project return to normal and progress acceler in the develop process attent wa preferenti given to the design and construct of the submarin and not enough attent wa given to the torpedo result in a void in the weapon system deng xiaop 6772 1420 1627 stress repeatedli that the nuclear submarin alon wa not a weapon becaus of thi zhang aip rigor supervis work on the submarin and the torpedo and paid special attent to the qualiti problem encount in the project in 1983 the first submarin wa complet and deliv to the navi for train us kei technolog in the submarin to land guid missil system and it instal were subsequ solv launch test of model missil from the nuclear submarin were conduct and succeed prove that the overal design wa correct and that the submarin missil and launch system were compat with thi china becam the fifth nation in the world to have a guid missil nuclear submarin section 3 3 improv the first gener of naval vessel in 1977 the central militari commiss decid that the develop ofth navi equip should still be focus on the submarin guid missil boat anti ship missil and torpedo in order to improv exist vessel the central militari commiss decid in 1978 that the qualiti of nuclear torpedo submarin and destroy mid size torpedo submarin larg missil boat and anti submarin escort should be improv and the system should be made more compat in novemb 1978 the central militari commiss approv the format of an engin leadership group for the abov

submarin chapter vi develop of nuclear weapon nuclear weapon make us of the energi releas from self sustain nuclear fission or fusion reaction for mass kill and destruct in 1955 china decid to initi it nuclear industri and to develop it nuclear weapon after 30 year china ha independ master the technolog of atom and hydrogen bomb and ha made major advanc in the develop of new nuclear weapon section 1 prepar for the develop of nuclear weapon l establish of nuclear scientif research center the develop of nuclear weapon reli on the establish of nuclear scienc and technolog and a nuclear industri befor the format of the peopl s republ of china although there wa the atom research institut in beij and the nuclear physic laboratori under the institut of physic in academia sinica the total number of research wa less than 10 and there wa not even a small acceler nuclear scienc and technolog wa basic a void in china at that time the new china stress the initi and develop of nuclear scienc and technolog in april 1950 the chines academi of scienc ca establish the institut of modern physic it main mission wa to establish a foundat for nuclear scienc and technolog and prepar for nuclear energi applic and develop the director of the institut wa wu youxun 0702 2589 6064 and the deputi director wa qian sanqiang the institut of modern physic had some renown scientist but there were too few of them and their specialti did not complement each other the press oblig at the time wa to attract talent and to expand the rank of scienc research with zhou enlai s interest and support the institut attract theoret physicist peng huanwu from qinghua univers and experiment physicist wang ganchang 3769 3227 2490 from zhejiang univers in 1955 13 scientist and oversea chines student came to the institut from europ and the unit state some of them risk their live to do so the famou nuclear physicist zhao zhongyao 6392 1813 1031 wa illeg detain by american troop in japan as he wa return to china from the unit state via japan it wa onli with the protest from the chines scientif commun and civil organ and the support of friend in the scientif commun in america and other countri that zhao wa freed by the american troop in thi period china also draft a group of young technician and capabl colleg graduat to move the nuclear research forward in spring 1949 newli liber beij did not have the necessari equip for nuclear research minist li weihan 2621 4850 3352 of the unit front work depart under the communist central committe approv a special foreign exchang fund the monei wa transfer by qian xuesen indirectli to two oversea chines student in franc and england with the help of the curi laboratori in franc and some british friend thei manag to bui a batch of equip and literatur and brought them back to china despit the embargo thi equip and data togeth with the 30 box of equip brought by zhao zhongyao from the unit state becam the main resourc of the institut of modern physic in the earli dai leader of the institut led the staff in learn from the yanan spirit and made the most out of old and discard equip some of the electron compon were bought in salvag yard and mani instrument were built by the research themselv gradual the research facil wa improv and some result were obtain with zhao zhongyao in charg the institut built a 700 kv atmospher electrostat acceler and a high voltag 2 5 mev electrostat acceler with he zehui 0149 3419 1979 in charg the institut built a number of nuclear detector and instrument with wang ganchang as the design the institut also built a 30 x 30 x 10 cm sup 3 7000 gauss cloud chamber on luoxueshan in yunnan thei built china s first mountain cosmic rai laboratori at an elev of 3 180 meter and began research on strang particl peng huanwu and other initi research on nuclear physic elementari particl physic and reactor theori research in the radiat chemistri group began the extract purif and analysi of uranium and the develop of heavi water and high puriti graphit by 1955 the institut of modern physic had ongo research in six area and had train a group of kei research some research result were obtain and the foundat of china s nuclear scienc and technolog wa establish in the mid 1950s when the central committe of the chines communist parti promot the develop of atom energi r d in nuclear sciencemad new advanc notabl a 7000 kw experiment heavi water reactor and a 1 2 meter diamet cyclotron were built in tuoli beij and put into oper in septemb 1958 the construct of the reactor and cyclotron wa organ by liu wei 0149 0251 administr of the architectur and construct bureau under the state construct commiss and guid by soviet expert and built by beij municip the third ministri of machin build and the architectur and engin depart in close cooper after that the atom energi institut formerli the institut of modern physic wa led by the ca and the second ministri of machin build mostli under the latter while complet the reactor and the cyclotron the atom energi institut also import laboratori facil from the soviet union for uranium isotop separ by ga diffus instrument develop independ includ high voltag multipli crystal spectromet neutron spectromet neutron selector nanosecond oscilloscop and a zero power reactor a total of 50 instrument were built and research began in nuclear physic reactor physic plutonium chemistri and isotop separ in earli 1960 the institut had a total of 4 300 peopl with 1 500 of them be technic staff have a colleg educ work began in 20 disciplin and 60 branch gradual a comprehens nuclear scienc r d center wa form it prepar personnel and technolog for china s independ develop of a nuclear industri and nuclear weapon 2 build up a nuclear industri while establish nuclear scienc and technolog china also began a survei of uranium resourc under the leadership of deputi minist liu jie 0149 2638 of the ministri of geologi prepar for the mine of uranium began in februari 1954 from june to octob 1954 geologist gao zhizhang 7559 0037 2627 and other survei haicheng in liaon and fuzhong and shanmuchong in guangxi where uranium wa discov befor the new china thei brought back uranium or sampl from shanmuchong these find receiv the attent of mao zedong and zhou enlai who were quickli brief by liu jie mao said we ar veri hope there ar bound to be uranium mine we onli have to look for them after accomplish some preliminari achiev in nuclear technolog and make some discoveri in uranium mine the chines communist parti held an expand meet of it central secretariat on 15 januari 1955 in thi meet chair by mao zedong a polici wa formul to develop china s atom energi that decis mark the begin of china s nuclear industri and nuclear weapon develop on 20 januari an agreement wa sign by china and the soviet union to conduct a joint survei of uranium deposit in china in april the state council decid to establish a third bureau of the ministri of geologi under the third offic of the state council lei rongtian 7191 2837 1131 wa name bureau chief in charg of all geolog effort relat to uranium mine in china also uranium geolog survei team such as the hunan 309 team and the xinjiang 519 team were form with peopl draft from relev depart region and arm servic in china the draft order came from the parti central committe the state council and the central militari commiss under the organ of the third bureau of the ministri of geologi and the advic of the soviet expert the geolog survei team found a larg number of radiat anomali includ 11 site worthi of further investig the survei effort and industri evalu continu and the first uranium reserv data were report to the state by 1960 there were eight mine site for uranium and the first set of uranium mine requir wa satisfi as china wa plan it first batch of uranium mine process plant and nuclear fuel plant it wa face with a question how largeshould the nuclear industri be in earli 1957 zhou enlai point out that china should have it own nuclear industri system and it own nuclear forc howev the problem wa to go from have not to have so the scale should not be too larg base on thi the third ministri of machin build re evalu the plan in the china soviet agreement and felt that the scale of the plan wa too big after repeat studi and to satisfi the requir of maintain a complet set of nuclear industri thei propos a smaller but complet plan the size of the uranium concentr plant wa greatli reduc and invest wa reduc by 40 percent the new propos suit the chines situat better and wa approv by the parti central committe and the state council anoth import issu in china s nuclear industri develop wa how to implement the polici of mainli self reliant but strive for extern assist in the 1959 movement of technolog innov and revolut some peopl want to improv the technolog by revis the soviet plant design and the design of instrument and meter minist song renqiong 1345 01717 4522 report thi situat to mao zedong in a letter mao s comment wa let us learn how to walk befor we learn how to run base on thi the second ministri of machin build urg all the technic worker to patient learn from the soviet expert and to understand the soviet technolog it wa emphas that no revis were permit befor master the soviet technolog and equip and instrument suppli by the soviet union were not to be modifi or dismantl in case where the soviet technolog did not suit the chines situat necessari improv were made onli after experiment research and with the approv of the soviet expert the state council also decid that when equip and raw materi could be found in china thei should be suppli domest an effort wa made to produc special equip in china thu creat the abil to design and manufactur the need equip the construct of the atom energi institut wa acceler and special research organ for uranium mine geologi and uranium or refin were establish the initi of the research personnel wa fulli mobil and self relianc wa enhanc in the nationwid great leap forward movement there were instanc of push safeti and qualiti asid in the pursuit of product and construct schedul for such behavior the second ministri of machin build took a firm stand and clearli side with qualiti and safeti construct not meet qualiti standard had to be bulldoz and rebuilt deputi minist in charg of capit construct liu wei inde led the destruct of substandard build and start construct all over again thi rigor attitud got the attent of the construct unit and ensur the qualiti of construct in the build up of the nuclear industri china properli handl the issu of self relianc outsid assist construct scope and nation resourc the correct polici and practic led to veri good result in august 1960 uranium mine in chenxian counti and hengshan dapu in hunan and shengyao in jiangxi were near complet the uranium process plant in hengyang hunan began instal equip the lanzhou uranium enrich plant wa partial equip and the associ civil construct for the atom enterpris in qiuchuan gansu and the fuel element plant in baotou inner mongolia were also near complet the success build up of the nuclear industri made the develop of nuclear weapon possibl section 2 develop of the first atom bomb to speed up the pace of nuclear weapon develop china activ sought help from the soviet union the agreement on new defensetechnolog sign by china and the soviet union contain an articl state that the soviet union would help china develop it nuclear weapon the implement of thi agreement wa rel smooth in the begin and contribut to the construct of nuclear weapon develop base in northwest china howev as the split between the two parti and the two countri deepen the govern of the soviet union not onli ceas to provid teach model and graphic data for the atom bomb but also unilater void the agreement in august 1960 the soviet union withdrew all 233 expert assist china s develop of the nuclear industri and carri awai import graph and data the suppli of equip and materi stop shortli thereaft the unilater action by the soviet union to tear up the agreement caus sever difficulti and great loss in china s nuclear industri and nuclear weapon develop at thi kei moment the parti central committe decid to develop the atom bomb with china s own resourc thi import polici stimul the patriot fervor and nation pride of the develop personnel thei were determin to develop the atom bomb with their own intellig and skill thei were determin to break the hegemoni nuclear monopoli and bring glori to china and it peopl 1 tackl kei problem in atom bomb develop at the end of the 1950s china s nuclear base in the northwest were still under construct and not readi to begin r d work the second ministri of machin build decid to begin the research and design of the atom bomb in the nuclear weapon institut establish in beij in juli 1958 effort were put in three area the first area wa

and complet nuclear data accur and complet nuclear data ar import to the design of nuclear devic scientist at the nuclear weapon institut discov mani inconsist in nuclear data in the literatur in februari 1965 he zehui of the atom energi institut led 30 research staff to conduct nuclear reaction cross section measur for thermonuclear materi thei us the research result obtain by ding dazhao and other and obtain reliabl experiment data after half a year of experiment research d conduct exploratori h bomb test to understand thermonuclear reaction and to obtain first hand inform as need in the h bomb design the central special committe approv the test of an enhanc atom bomb the design of the enhanc atom bomb wa base on the first experiment atom bomb but contain a certain amount of thermonuclear materi the structur wa modifi correspondingli theoret design proceed quickli and us onli about half a year sinc the new test us compon of the deton system that wa emploi in the two previou atom bomb test the fabric process also progress quickli from septemb 1965 to april 1966 deton subcrit and environment test were complet on 9 mai 1966 an atmospher test of the enhanc atom bomb wa successfulli conduct thi test provid real data for the theoret studi of the h bomb e break through the h bomb design after a year of investig scientist clearli recogn that in order to break through the h bomb design principl thei must pursu mani approach and understand the princip factor that affect the burn of the thermonuclear materi and the rule of energi releas from februari to juli 1965 the theoret depart of the nuclear weapon institut concentr on sever structur propos and conduct repeat calcul the result were not satisfactori face an impass scientist consolid experi and conduct variou special topic symposia and discuss so that everyon could think about the problem and come up with new concept new idea and new propos the main direct for pursu the h bomb theori wa determin thi wai in the summer of 1965 scientist at the nuclear weapon institut learn from foreign new media that franc plan to conduct a test of their first thermonuclear devic in 1968 to win on for china and the chines peopl thei propos to realiz china s first h bomb befor the french deputi director yu min of the theoret depart of the institut led staff member to the huadong comput institut in shanghai befor nation dai and spent all the holidai calcul model after analysi thei obtain import result in the burn rule of thermonuclear materi howev the model wa too heavi and the specif power and specif fusion were low and did not meet the criterion of 1 million ton of tnt for everi ton yu min summar the result and made a seri of report staff member calcul some more ideal model and discov the kei in sustain burn of thermonuclear materi thi import issu in the h bomb principl wa thu resolv 2 speed up the product of thermonuclear materi and the develop of thermonuclear compon anoth import step in the develop of the h bomb wa the product of thermonuclear materi and thermonuclear compon just as china wa about to instal it first lithium deuterid 6 product line the soviet union cut off aid to china the second ministri of machin build immedi transfer the scientist engag in light isotop separ in the atom energi institut to the baotou nuclear fuel element plant to solv technic problem with assist from the atom energi institut beij univers and qinghua univers plant personnel tackl 95 topic center on the product of thermonuclear materi and solv the problem of the exchang tower enrich process and the product rate of the chemic exchang system meanwhil the first ministri of machin build activ sought out product equip like the reagent pump of the shenyang water pump plant and electrolysi trough and satisfi the need of the lithium deuterid 6 product line instal the instal personnel activ develop instal tool modifi the instal method and complet the instal of the main unit in earli 1963 in spring 1963 the lithium deuterid 6 product line wa readi for a test run the intermedi test for heavi water the materi for produc deuterium had basic been accept but industri scale product of heavi water wa still not possibl the central special committe request the ministri of chemic industri to includ the project at an earlier date in juli the committe again studi the heavi water problem and decid that the ministri of chemic industri should give top prioriti to small shop for produc heavi water the ministri then organ dalian greas chemic plant and shanghai institut of chemic engin and acceler the process of produc heavi water by electrolyt exchang accept heavi water wa produc in decemb 1963 and in mai 1964 there wa therefor a technolog base for build a heavi water plant subsequ the jilin chemic industri compani quickli built a small heavi water product shop and produc the first batch of accept heavi water with strong support from the beij institut of chemic design the first ministri of machin build and other depart in thi period the test run of the lithium deuterid 6 product line succeed on the first try and produc it first batch of product the plant then acquir the abil to produc lithium chlorid and metal lithium and produc deuterium by electrolyt decompos heavi water on 11 septemb 1965 the plant synthes it first charg of lithium deuterid 6 the northwest nuclear weapon develop base wa respons for machin lithium deuterid 6 into thermonuclear materi compon for the h bomb accord to the design shape and size in earli 1965 song jiashu 1345 1367 2885 and other scientist began the r d of thermonuclear compon the first problem thei encount wa the machin of the thermonuclear materi thei took a three prongedapproach to break through the technolog after repeat test thei settl on a fabric method that could yield near theoret densiti blank with fewer defect at a lower pressur scientist and worker were veri consciou about safeti in their work thei properli handl the possibl ignit problem of the thermonuclear materi dure mechan process thei also test dozen of coat and final found on coat that help the short term storag problem of thermonuclear compon after almost a year of develop the first set of accept lithium deuterid 6 compon wa produc and the fuel problem for the enhanc atom bomb and h bomb test wa solv these result were veri crucial for the success develop of the h bomb 3 the first hydrogen bomb successfulli develop in decemb 1965 expert of the northwest nuclear weapon institut conduct a seri of studi these studi were chair by deputi director wu jilin 0702 7139 7207 and particip in by deputi minist leu xiyao 0149 6007 1031 and li jue of the second ministri of machin build and second bureau chief hu ruexia 5170 5387 3838 of the defens scienc commiss after these studi it wa determin that the theoret propos of trigger the h bomb with the atom bomb wa reason and feasibl accord to the basic principl base on thi analysi it wa possibl to have a smaller and lighter 1 megaton h bomb with a higher specif fusion at the end of 1967 or the first half of 1968 the emphasi for break through the h bomb technolog wa therefor place on the new propos howev the new propos wa onli a concept and it success wa not ensur on the other hand the origin plan h bomb although larger heavier and have a smaller specif fusion ratio wa more like to succe base on theoret consider for thi reason research and test of the origin design wa not abandon either with the two prong approach as the guid concept the second ministri of machin build formul the 1966 and 1967 plan for nuclear weapon develop the plan were approv by the central special committe after that the committe approv the specif step to implement the 2 year plan and the request by the relev depart to cooper the new arrang for break through the h bomb technolog develop quickli in the new plan the difficult task of trigger the thermonuclear devic with the atom bomb had to be overcom after hundr of deton simul experi and mani in depth academ discuss a clever method emploi by chen changyi and tao zucong 7118 4371 5115 solv thi technic problem and provid experiment data for the theoret design of the deton to design the bodi of the h bomb physicist and mechan research studi the physic pictur and mechan in the explos process of the thermonuclear devic investig the effect of the explos of the deton bomb on the main h bomb and master the layout of the compon and the relationship of energi releas the theoret design of the h bomb bodi wa thu formul howev by the time the theoret design plan for the entir experiment devic wa hand to the design and manufactur depart it wa alreadi mid octob 1966 the design and manufactur depart had veri littl time to complet the engin design and to

variou depart conduct plan test and prove that there wa veri littl surfac particul contamin all dosag were within the allow rang to prais and encourag the peopl who had particip in the develop and test of the nuclear weapon the communist parti central committe and nation leader zhou enlai lin biao chen yi he long nie rongzhen and luo ruiq receiv the depart leader scientist technic expert and pilot in the great hall of the peopl on 30 mai section 4 test of missil with nuclear warhead to test a missil with a nuclear warhead the missil serv as the carrier and a nuclear warhead is deliv to a target locat to caus a nuclear explos on 27 octob 1966 china successfulli deliv an atom bomb with a medium to short rang missil and conduct a nuclear explos test it mark the possess of practic missil warhead weapon by china 1 a care decis on 5 decemb 1963 the central special committe made a decis that china s nuclear weapon develop should be base mainli on missil deliv warhead supplement by aircraft deliv warhead to link up the atom bomb technolog with the missil technolog technic discuss and coordin were held by scientist and engin from the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build and the fifth academi of the ministri of defens these activ were organ by the central special committe the defens industri offic and the defens scienc commiss r d effort were initi accord to technic topic sinc china had no experi in thi area it had to go through a learn process in evalu the perform of the missil s atom warhead initi the nuclear weapon institut believ that an atom bomb would be readi for instal on a medium to short rang missil after ground simul test for missil flight environ deton test full rang flight test of the deton control system and underground test of the perform of the nuclear warhead for thi reason the third nuclear test arrang by the defens scienc commiss wa an underground test the purpos wa to determin the power and perform paramet of the medium to short rang missil with an atom warhead in novemb 1965 the defens scienc commiss and the second ministri of machin build did some in depth analysi and decid that the underground test could not test whether the atom bomb would satisfi the actual flight condit in order to develop nuclear warhead that could surviv the flight test the underground test wa temporarili put on hold instead a cold test under flight condit would be conduct onc there wa strong confid a hot flight test would be made in term of actual need the hot flight test would be best conduct at full equival and full rang so as to test the combin of the atom bomb and missil technolog on 13 decemb the second ministri made such a suggest to the central special committe at the end of decemb zhou enlai chair the central special committe meet and carefulli studi the suggest zhou ask the defens scienc commiss to make up sever scenario and make some comparison for the committe to evalu in februari 1966 the defens scienc commiss invit leader from the second and seventh ministri of machin build the gener staff the equip plan depart the northwest gener missil test base and the nuclear test base to studi the test propos of the modifi medium to short rang surfac to surfac missil with nuclear warhead the meet decid that neither ground simul test nor underground explos test could truli simul the actual fight condit to test the combin of the missil and the atom bomb a cold flight test could not evalu the actual condit of the atom bomb dure flight a full rang full power hot test with a normal trajectori and a low altitud explos would not onli achiev the test goal but would also conform to actual war condit in term of reliabl and test safeti the modifi medium to short rang missil had it own self destruct devic if a malfunct occur dure the power part of the flight a signal could be sent from the ground to destroi the missil the nuclear warhead had a safeti switch and the switch would not open if the warhead fell off dure flight the bomb bodi would be destroi upon impact the ground but there would not be a nuclear fission reaction so the hot test wa feasibl from a safeti point of view it wa therefor decid that a cold test would be made as a practic run follow by a hot test in the meet specif studi were also made for the launch site the target zone the rang the explos altitud the test item and the divis of task on 26 februari the defens scienc commiss report the studi result to the central special committe on 11 march zhou enlai chair a central special committe meet and carefulli studi the defens scienc commiss report base on the technolog level at the time and the desir to quickli develop and test a missil warhead the central special committe agre to the test plan propos by the defens scienc commiss the committe ask the scienc commiss to organ the second and seventh ministri and conduct more preparatori test so that the test could be guarante absolut safe the commiss also set a date of the end of august for complet all preparatori test 2 care prepar in order to guarante the absolut safeti of the hot flight test of the nuclear warhead missil the defens scienc commiss the offic of defens industri and the second and seventh ministri of machin build made care prepar in march and june 1966 the defens scienc commiss twice review the technic plan launch plan measur plan and accid handl plan and set a progress schedul for field engin weather commun aviat and logist task meanwhil special topic studi and arrang were also made for the polit work of the test mission the offic of defens industri also call a number of meet of the second and seventh ministri to studi the develop and test of the missil and warhead problem that aros in the coordin were resolv in a time manner the nuclear weapon institut of the second ministri of machin build conduct a seri of test for the nuclear devic and the deton control system it also revisit the reliabl of the deton system and the self destruct system and conclud that reliabl wa assur plant and institut of the seventh ministri of machin build complet the product mission on schedul and maintain high qualiti thei also conduct self destruct test of the bomb and prove that the safeti system function reliabl the northwest gener missil test base propos a launch plan select the launch posit built a temporari launch pad underground

the target zone inaccur call out by command personnel sluggish hand oper and malfunct of individu instrument were correct on 25 septemb zhou enlai again chair the central special committe meet and in principl approv the arrang of the defens scienc commiss to conduct joint self destruct test in octob cold flight test in mid octob and to determin the date for the hot test base on the result of the abov two test the central special committe also order the defens scienc commiss to form a joint group for unifi command to temporarili evacu the 10 000 resid under the flight path of the missil at the end of septemb the missil and warhead us for the self destruct test and for the cold flight test arriv at the northwest gener missil test base test at the base and commun dure the test weather aviat medic care protect and smoke and cloud detect outsid the test site had all been properli handl the safeti of the resid wa put on a solid basi to ensur that the hot flight of the combin test wa failur proof a combin flight test wa conduct at the northwest gener missil test base on 7 octob to evalu the safeti self destruct system after the launch all the instrument on the missil and on the ground function normal follow the plan procedur trajectori and time the warhead wa first destroi in the air follow by the destruct of the missil bodi the target zone also went through a normal procedur exercis the test result show that the missil function normal and the safeti self destruct system wa reliabl the goal of the test had been achiev on 8 octob zhou enlai chair a central special committe meet and heard zhang zhenhuan s report on the combin test the self destruct experi and the prepar for the cold and hot flight test zhou wa also brief on the weather forecast for octob zhou point out that sinc the test wa to be conduct on land there could be no accid the cold test had to be carefulli inspect the hot had to be even more carefulli monitor everi step had to be 100 percent problem free the nuclear warhead had to go through impact test includ obliqu impact and later impact the warhead had to be guarante not to explod under variou anomal condit the cold flight wa schedul around the 15th test result had to be submit within 2 or 3 dai so that chairman mao could make up hi mind zhou assign zhang zhenhuan to be respons for thi test at 8 33 on 13 octob the first cold test missil wa successfulli launch at 1730 on the 16th a second cold test missil wa launch load with simul warhead these two missil made normal flight the deton control system work reliabl and the explos compon were deton at the plan altitud abov the target zone the reliabl of the missil and the deton control system wa again verifi in these two cold test all formal procedur and step were execut in the launch zone and the target zone the test serv as overal check for all the preparatori work 3 combin test on 12 octob zhou enlai call a special meet and togeth with nie rongzhen ye jiani and yang chengwu wa brief by zhang zhenhuan about detail of the launch zone inspect and target zone prepar join by leader of the relev depart and expert thei again made an across the board review of the test prepar and safeti issu ye point out that the success of that test would attract great attent in china the hot test wa the final test and everyth had to be check carefulli includ everi screw and human error had to be elimin zhou stress that the test must be fail safe and assign nie rongzhen to take charg of the launch nie arriv at the northwest gener missil test base on 25 octob and heard a brief on the test situat of the missil and the warhead he inspect the test prepar and relai mao zedong s instruct given in the previou even when mao heard nie s brief mao said that the upcom test could succe or fail but it would not matter even if it fail nie took mao s comment to mean that peopl should prepar for the worst but do their best to succe nie ask the lead cadr to carri out mao s instruct and carefulli execut the final prepar at 1600 hour the test committe studi the weather forecast for the next 48 hour in the launch zone and the target zone it wa deep autumn weather and the wind wa strong at the launch zone the forecast wa that weather would improv after daybreak on the 26th nie agre with the opinion of the test committe that the formal launch should be schedul for the 27th at the launch site the test team carefulli complet all test for the missil and made sure that all the technic specif were met scientist of the northwest nuclear weapon develop base repeatedli and rigor inspect and test each compon with assist from scientist of the first academi of the seventh ministri of machin build final assembl of the nuclear warhead wa carefulli check out at about 9 o clock on the 26th the test committe determin that the launch time would be 9 o clock on the 27th zhou enlai approv thi launch time and ask peopl to calmli do their job launch team no 2 under the leadership of yan zhenq 7346 2182 3237 accur carri out sever hundr oper all prepar fulli met the requir the nuclear missil wa readi for launch at 2 am on the 27th the target zone suddenli had 6 7 grade strong wind thi weather chang wa not good for safeti in the target zone zhang yunyu be in charg of the target zone prepar for the worst case scenario and organ peopl for emerg evacu prepar meanwhil he kept a close ey on the weather at thi kei moment the weather depart of the base made real time observ of the weather and after rigor calcul determin that the strong wind would move out of the target zone at 8 o clock at a speed of 50 km hr the weather would then turn fair that forecast turn out to be veri accur and the strong wind inde move out of the region at about 8 o clock at about 9 o clock the launch command gave the launch order immedi the missil wa ignit and leap into the air follow the program it ascend turn and flew in a westward direct after separ from the missil bodi the warhead flew toward the target zone as program the observ instrument in the target zone aim at the incom warhead and the remot sens instrument receiv radio signal for target acquir and remot sens signal normal at 09 09 14 the nuclear warhead explod abov the target zone at an altitud of 569 meter it turn into an incandesc firebal and emit a blind flash after some violent churn of smoke and cloud a mushroom cloud slowli rose all the measur instrument in the target zone function well and obtain data preliminari test result show that the explos power wa in agreement with the theoret design valu the test wa a success the success of thi test show that china now had a practic nuclear missil it wa highli signific for china in term of an acceler pace for nuclear weapon develop and a stronger nation power in the meantim china also gain the full experi of develop a nuclear warhead after that other model of china s surfac to surfac nuclear warhead did not go through thi type of actual flight test section 5 first hydrogen bomb test on 28 decemb 1966 2 year and 2 month after it first atom bomb test china successfulli explod it first hydrogen bomb on a tower in lop nur half a year after that on 17 june 1967 china conduct it first success hydrogen bomb airburst test 1 first hydrogen bomb principl test at the end of decemb 1965 the central special committe approv a principl explos test of a hydrogen bomb to be conduct around the end of 1966 in earli april 1966 the defens scienc commiss organ a studi of the principl test for a hydrogen bomb after analysi and debat it wa conclud that the spare steel tower for the first atom bomb test could be us for the hydrogen bomb principl test the engin research institut wa to redesign the room for instal the hydrogen bomb and the hoist system in the meantim the measur requir of the hydrogen bomb principl test were studi new measur item were ad and the measur task were assign to variou unit subsequ the nuclear test base decid the posit of the steel tower and formul the experiment plan new measur item were determin and need instrument were arrang in mid june the defens scienc commiss review the experiment plan discuss the safeti measur for nearbi resid in the downwind direct and investig the effect test plan the commiss ask that prepar for the test be complet by 1 decemb the central special committe approv the test plan and work assign of the defens scienc commiss prepar continu at the test site by the particip unit engin prepar thi test involv a total of 113 engin project and need 1 400 kilomet of electr cabl the test base us onli 5 month to complet the project with accept qualiti the steel tower construct began on 18 june and wa complet at the end of octob the total number of work dai wa less than 100 and it took 80 dai less to construct than the first tower measur prepar the main issu of the measur prepar were to determin which measur data should be us to evalu the success of the hydrogen bomb test and which techniqu should be us to acquir these data theoret design and measur expert discuss and formul the test item to evalu the work condit of the hydrogen bomb in the initi phase four new test item were ad these task were accomplish by the cooper of a number of institut includ the nuclear weapon institut the atom energi institut the physic institut of the chines academi of scienc the shanghai institut of optic and fine mechan the xi an institut of optic and fine mechan the changchun institut of optic and fine mechan and zhejiang univers the effort wa led by the nuclear weapon test institut the test emploi 1 014 piec of instrument and requir onli 1 month to finish the on site instal safeti and protect compar with previou test thi test wa character by greater power lower explos point and greater surfac contamin the power of the hydrogen test wa hamper by the steel tower and other field condit even with reduc load of fission and fusion materi in the design it explos power wa still 5 to 6 time greater than china s first atom bomb to reduc the impact of radioact fallout on the test zone and the downwind direct expert from the health depart of the defens scienc commiss and the militari medic colleg made exhaust studi of safeti issu their consensu wa that the test would not affect the health of the resid studi by cheng kaijia and other had shown that the weather condit at the test must be carefulli chosen in addit the ground surfac within 230 meter of the tower base must be reinforc with cement and rock to reduc the amount of loos soil swept into the cloud simul test made with convent explos show that these measur were equival to rais the steel tower by 60 meter the safeti of the test wa assur test the explos effect to further investig the effect of the hydrogen bomb explos on structur and weapon and to studi the biolog effect the defens scienc commiss organ 16 militari unit and arrang 81 test us 1 377 articl of 158 differ type test command and logist protect in formul the test plan for thi test the nuclear test base recogn the complex and safeti requir of the test prepar were initi for commun air travel weather action plan safeti protect emerg evacu and result recoveri the test wa

fallout situat in china after the nuclear test the ministri of health establish the industri hygien institut as a nation center and built 46 environment radiat monitor station around the countri in each nuclear test these station measur the amount of dust fallout radioact concentr in near surfac air radioact in rain water and water sourc the degre of contamin of veget and gamma rai dosag at the ground surfac to studi the long term effect of radioact contamin the ministri of health made two larg scale survei in 1975 and 1977 respect on the radiat exposur and health situat of resid in dunhuan and jiuquan the survei were conduct by the industri hygien institut of the ministri of health the industri hygien institut of gansu and chemic troop in the lanzhou militari region in june 1979 these unit made a comprehens analysi of the monitor data and resid health data collect in the variou nuclear test the conclus wa that radiat exposur of the resid wa minor it wa less than the natur radiat background of the region and also less than the limit set in the radiat protect regul in comparison studi there wa also no evid that the resid health had been affect by the dust fallout of the nuclear test china ha acquir a great amount of data on aerial radioact cloud and radioact dust fallout outsid the test zone in it mani atmospher nuclear test it ha learn the movement behavior of radioact cloud and the characterist of radioact fallout it ha also found empir calcul method for forecast the path and concentr of radioact cloud and the contamin of ground air and rain water by fallout these find were crucial for the protect of troop movement and resid safeti base on the measur data and analysi of radiat dosag in downwind area it wa conclud that china s nuclear test pose no danger to the popul of neighbor countri in the downwind direct becaus china paid so much attent to the health and safeti of the popul within and without china and work so hard on safeti and protect all it 23 nuclear test were conduct safe section 8 underground nuclear test in underground nuclear test the nuclear devic is buri at a certain depth underground and then deton gener there ar two type of underground test tunnel nuclear test and shaft nuclear test compar to atmospher nuclear test underground test requir a higher degre of technolog more construct work and a higher cost howev thei have certain uniqu advantag such test not onli contain the radioact product underground which is desir in term of environment protect and secreci but also facilit the collect of radioact product sampl in particular physic diagnost measur mai be carri out veri close to the nuclear devic result of underground test ar us for improv nuclear weapon design and for studi the linear destruct effect of radiat these data ar indispens in the theoret research and design of nuclear weapon the move from atmospher test to underground test wa necessit by the object need of nuclear weapon develop 1 tunnel test in a tunnel test a special design long tunnel is dug into a mountain the nuclear devic and variou probe ar instal in the tunnel after the tunnel is fill and seal in a special wai the nuclear devic is deton follow instruct from zhou enlai the second ministri of machin build and the defens scienc commiss made a preliminari investig of the underground nuclear test problem later the defens scienc commiss follow the decis of the central special committe and organ the nuclear test base to formul a plan for nuclear test in tunnel and in shaft to thi end zhang yunyu zhang zhishang and zhang ying did a care site select for underground nuclear test and propos that the site for the tunnel test be chosen at nanshan in the nuclear test base the propos wa approv by zhou enlai in earli 1965 an extens studi wa organ by the defens scienc commiss and the site of the nanshan underground test wa final the studi wa conduct by the defens engin design institut of the engin the geologi institut of the chines academi of scienc the ministri of petroleum and the ministri of geologi the studi investig the geologi the hydrogeolog the rock chemistri and the mechan properti of rock later the nuclear weapon institut conduct theoret calcul for the propag of shock wave in rock and for the self seal mechan of the tunnel simul test were perform for chemic explos and the theoret paramet were unifi and revis these activ were the technic prepar for the underground nuclear test china origin plan to conduct it first underground test us a tunnel in mai 1966 later the plan wa temporarili halt by the central special committe becaus china want to come up with a flight test warhead as soon as possibl and to concentr resourc on the technolog breakthrough of the hydrogen bomb after the first success air burst test of china s hydrogen bomb in 1967 the defens scienc commiss held detail discuss with expert includ wang ganchang and cheng kaijia in octob and novemb regard the object test item and engin requir for china s first underground test it wa decid that the princip object of china s first tunnel nuclear test wa to explor the characterist of china s underground nuclear test and to conduct near field physic measur of the nuclear bomb in order to provid data for improv nuclear bomb design in mai 1965 the construct and progress of the variou task were coordin at the nuclear test base after redefin the task the construct for the underground test continu in the spring of 1969 becaus of technic requir there were a number of modif the tunnel construct involv extens engin complex technolog limit work surfac and high risk in view of these characterist the nuclear test base organ an engin command a technic guidanc command and a tool and materi suppli command and establish a sound construct procedur worker were fearless and work around the clock in the hot and stuffi tunnel togeth thei improv the technolog and complet 54 experiment engin project in june accord to plan and meet qualiti standard test and scientif experiment were arrang by the nuclear weapon design academi and the nuclear weapon institut after 2 month thei complet the instal and test of 400 piec of equip in earli septemb to assur safeti the defens scienc commiss met at the test site in april 1969 and work on technic measur that would prevent mishap in the test such as blow the top jump the gun misfir and dud in the even of 10 august the central special committe heard the report of deputi command zhang ying of the nuclear test base regard the prepar of the test site zhou enlai stress that the test must be done safe so that accid such as blow the top and leak of radioact materi could be avoid the nuclear test base again calcul the resist and wave absorpt in the tunnel and analyz the variou extern environ factor and thei were sure that the prevent measur taken would prevent jump the gun on 15 septemb the nuclear devic wa place in the explos chamber and the tunnel wa subsequ seal at 0015 on 23 septemb china successfulli deton it first tunnel nuclear test the tunnel s self seal mechan work and there were no blow the top or jump the gun incid the yield of the nuclear explos wa basic in agreement with the design to understand the characterist of tunnel nuclear test and to verifi the agreement between the theoret design and the actual explos the tunnel and explos chamber were excav from 1970 to 1971 the height and the size of the chimnei caus by the explos were measur and the effect of the self seal and fill function were investig three core were drill to collect the radioact materi gener by the explos first hand data of these investig show that the self seal technolog and the specimen core technolog were success the theoret understand of the fluid mechan of an underground nuclear explos wa basic in agreement with realiti diagnost measur made near the nuclear bomb yield import data and point to new direct in the develop of near field physic measur through thi test understand of underground nuclear test wa valid and enhanc and major interfer problem were reveal in the near field physic measur becaus the test wa conduct in limeston it gener a great amount of carbon monoxid and carbon dioxid which were detriment to the safeti of radiat chemistri analysi it wa not desir to conduct underground nuclear test in limeston the nuclear test base therefor move the test site to the granit beishan north mountain underground test site to gain more experi in underground nuclear test to improv the weapon design and to test new nuclear principl five more test were conduct from 1975 to the end of 1988 at the nanshan and beishan test site in the second tunnel nuclear test on 27 decemb 1975 import data were obtain in the near field physic diagnost measur these data help solv the technic problem in tunnel self seal rapid sampl acquisit and electromagnet interfer in near field physic measur in the third tunnel nuclear test on 17 octob 1976 new advanc were made in rapid sampl acquisit and new understand were gain in nuclear explos in granit and anti interfer technolog in the fourth nuclear tunnel test on 4 mai 1983 rapid sampl core wa achiev for the first time abund high qualiti solid sampl of radioact materi for chemic analysi were obtain in the first drill meanwhil major advanc were made in near field physic measur technolog on 19 decemb 1984 the fifth nuclear tunnel test wa conduct the test wa made for a new principl in nuclear weapon and the experi wa a success china had made a major breakthrough in new nuclear weapon technolog 2 shaft nuclear test in a shaft test the nuclear devic and variou sensor ar lower to the bottom of a larg diamet well the well is then fill and the nuclear devic deton due to the depth limit of a tunnel test most mountain cannot satisfi the experiment requir thi is particularli true for high power explos in a shaft test there is usual no limit to explos power as long as the underground rock ar suitabl for test a shaft can be drill to the depth need for the particular explos power for thi reason the shaft test mode ha becom the princip method for underground nuclear test in april 1967 china chose the xing er region northwest of lop nur for the shaft test site after year of effort a complet experiment facil and live quarter were establish and variou equip develop the necessari condit for conduct the test were basic provid a shaft nuclear test requir a well with a larg diamet and a certain depth drill such a shaft requir a larg drill rig in octob 1966 the nuclear test base the nuclear weapon institut and engin depart survei coal mine oil field and machineri depart and submit a propos to the defens scienc commiss to develop a larg diamet hard rock drill machin on 9 mai the central special

all the same and the oper god forbid collaps at sea full blame for the collaps will rest with incompet ministri offici who were unabl to think through all the detail and that such an outcom cannot be rule out is born out by sever fact sergei khetagurov former chairman of the north ossetian council of minist who switch chair to becom deputi minist for emerg ha been put in charg of all measur relat to the komsomolet what can an offici who lost an elect in a complet landlock republ know about underwat oper on the other hand three month after the creation of the ministri administr in charg of the komsomolet problem it ha just on member reserv rear admir mikhail tolokonnikov former deputi chief of the old csuo but even that specialist wa recent depriv of hi government commun link and move into an offic with a singl citi telephon if the expedit to the komsomolet collaps ministri offici will be abl to blame the mistak and muddl within their own ministri on seemingli object difficulti caus by the delai in obtain expert environment review and the lack of financ and so department interest have prove stronger than the nation interest meanwhil the problem of make the komsomolet safe ha taken on a new intern aspect it is no secret that sizabl financi resourc ar be enlist for thi have caught the scent of monei repres of the most divers organ pursu their own interest ar descend on russia like moth to light on such organ is the komsomolet memori foundat which wa creat in holland and ha announc to the entir world that it is rais fund to rais the submarin in 1993 the foundat manag to rais about 140 000 to properli assess thi amount it must be said that russia itself spent an incompar greater sum 4 million and 1 billion rubl on oper relat to the komsomolet in that same year alon but not even all of the monei collect by the foundat reach russia in the form of purchas comput part of it stai behind in holland still on could onli welcom such assist from a privat organ especi consid that the foundat promis to make avail a further 2 million guilder just over 1 million in 1994 were it not for the fact that it outwardli selfless action conceal other far less altruist consider provis of the fund which incident the dutch govern not the foundat itself intend to provid as aid to russia is conting on a number of condit chief of which is that the dutch firm smith and heerem kheyerem be hire as the main contractor in oper involv the komsomolet thei ar both part of a dutch consortium that carri out underwat oper in other word the foundat ha assum the role of lobbyist for dutch interest in matter relat to the russian submarin howev that is not the end of the problem in the final analysi in order to avert an environment disast we could sacrific the interest of russian industrialist were it not for on but hire for the project dutch firm that do not have deep water unit at their dispos but do own hoist crane will most like lead to a fundament revis of the entir plan of action and to replac of the plan to seal the submarin with a plan to rais it in that case it will no longer be possibl to mount an expedit to the norwegian sea thi season and an environment disast will becom almost inevit in the summer of 1995 there will be an underwat chernobyl at the komsomolet site by that time the submarin s torpedo will be destroi complet and no on and noth will be abl to stop plutonium 239 from leak out in expert opinion the consequ of the impend catastroph will be veri grave the section of the ocean where the submarin li is on of the most product account for 80 percent of all fish taken from the norwegian sea the loss to russia from reduc catch alon as well as from fine paid to other countri abov all norwai will amount to hundr of million of dollar a year in addit rather larg suspend radioact particl that can be transport by current were found at the komsomolet site in august 1993 in the event of massiv plutonium discharg that will continu for sever year the strong underwat current in the region which reach speed of 1 5 meter per second and chang direct sever time a dai will lead to the rapid contamin of sever thousand squar kilomet of seafloor consid

FBIS4-67574: bfn viktor litovkin report the sunken komsomolet put out so signal text sergei khetagurov deputi minist for emerg situat ha told an interfax correspond that 15 june thi year the ministri will mount an expedit to the site of the disast involv the russian nuclear power submarin komsomolet which sank in the norwegian sea in april 1989 the purpos of the two month expedit aboard the research ship akademik keldysh is to seal the torpedo tube hatch the submarin ha two torpedo on board with nuclear warhead and these fill specialist with the greatest apprehens the deputi minist said it is imposs to rule out in principl a possibl spread of radioact as a result of corros of their case he believ at the veri same time academician vladimir zuyev depart head at the russian academi of scienc institut of oceanolog ha sent a letter to the russian presid s staff he report that despit the real possibl of a vollei discharg of weapon grade plutonium into the marin environ from the sunken komsomolet the expedit to it and the actual seal of the vessel ar in jeopardi lead specialist with rich experi of underwat work have been taken off it the necessari ecolog expert apprais ha not been carri out there is no feder program for the reliabl corros proof of an increas sourc of radioact danger and the necessari financi resourc have not yet been alloc to thi what is the problem here why doe the situat with regard to the sunken komsomolet elicit such increas attent and such contradictori assess sever nuclear power ship have sunk in recent year and so much radioact wast ha been dump in the ocean that the possibl of a leak of plutonium from two torpedo appear a mere trifl compar with the constant discharg of radiat from these graveyard dr of technic scienc tengiz borisov former chairman of the committe for carri out special purpos underwat work whose function have now been transfer to the ministri for emerg situat believ that thi is not quit the case the question of ensur the komsomolet radiat safeti is far more seriou than other similar tragic instanc there ar sever reason first the submarin li off the coast of norwai in norwai s tradit fish ground the discharg of plutonium into the water and trace of it were alreadi detect last year although thei do not yet exce the background valu could depriv that countri of fisheri for hundr of year destroi the modern fish process industri depriv ten of thousand of peopl of their livelihood and as a consequ drastic undermin russia s prestig and forc it to pai compens run into mani million in foreign currenc second russia it leadership and it specialist still have the technic and econom possibl of prevent the radiat pollut of the ocean corros proof the sunken vessel and deliv europ from the threat of an ecolog disast but preciou time must not be lost here we ar left with virtual the last chanc of carri out the work thi summer there will not be anoth opportun the torpedo beryllium case ar bound to break up within the next few month and then all effort will be in vain true not all the specialist familiar with the situat on the submarin share the anxieti of tengiz borisov hi colleagu at the institut of oceanolog or other scientist and practic underwat worker some of them mainli employe of the ministri for emerg situat maintain that fish is not conduct at a depth of 1 700 meter where the komsomolet li and so there is simpli no threat that plutonium will get into the fish diet and thenc onto peopl s tabl in addit thei sai in the opinion of nuclear scientist at the scientif research institut of experiment physic at arzama 16 where the torpedo nuclear warhead were creat the discharg of plutonium follow the destruct of the torpedo case will not have appreci radiat consequ either for the popul or for the fauna if a 100 percent discharg doe occur all the materi will settl in a compact stain between 30 and 400 km long at the same time the radiat dose will be virtual insignific at the far limit of the seat of radiat the izvestiya editori offic ha a copi of thi opinion of the scientif research institut of experiment physic approv by academician yurii trutnev and stanislav voronin of the russian academi of scienc the chief design of nuclear warhead it conclus do not coincid with those reach at the ministri for emerg situat it is not yet clear the scientist write whether the uncertainti that exist at the present time in the estim of seab pollut by the fission product of plutonium corros can affect the global conclus that the escap of plutonium from the nuclear weapon as their insul case is destroi ha no appreci radioact consequ further it is necessari to make a more detail assess of the possibl movement of plutonium from the bed to surfac layer as a consequ of the season migrat of plankton which winter on the bed and the compet process of spread of the plankton patch on the lift of plutonium build up from seab deposit if we translat the scientist word into simpl languag understand to everyon it becom clear that larg area of plankton plaster with the decomposit product of nuclear warhead or rather precis plutonium have zero buoyanc thei can be move by underwat current ani distanc from the scene of the tragedi and thu end up ultim in the food of someon live thousand of kilomet from the norwegian sea the academician believ that it would be prematur to conclud that in work with the nuclear power submarin komsomolet it is possibl to confin ourselv just to radiat monitor everyth must be done to make naval weapon system safe bear the possibl of accid in mind a similar conclus wa reach by the russian secur council interdepartment commiss on ecolog safeti which discuss thi problem at the end of last year what then is prevent thi from be done todai particularli as the ministri for emerg situat as sergei khetagurov declar is readi and ha plan to carri out the special expedit to seal the stricken submarin in the opinion of mani specialist with whom i have spoken about thi work on corros proof the sunken submarin is be hinder by department differ and by ambit which no less than the actual corros ar eat awai at formerli amic and unit

iron shoe pair and pair of shoe rest on the sea floor as if their owner had just step out of them peopl sai what wa it like to go to the titan particularli out in the debri area the stern section where everyon di ballard recal of the ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12 000 feet in the north atlant in 1912 kill 1 500 of the 2 200 passeng and crew there ar pair of shoe all over there where peopl actual came to rest on the bottom of the ocean their shoe ar still there shoe all over the bismarck boot all over the place anim won t eat process leather thei eat the bodi and the cloth but thei won t eat the leather oceanograph ballard in lo angel to announc that he will host a televis seri about underwat explor and other scientif ventur is somewher in the middl of a long explan about why he pursu the sunken past with such avid partli he conced it s for the sensat that onli discoveri can provid the moment of discoveri i think the thrill of explor is to see someth to be the first to set ey on someth that ha never been seen befor he sai the first time i saw the titan wow there it wa thi monstrou ship just came out of the gloom and there it wa for ballard the moment of discoveri is intellectu kinet an instant when he connect palpabl with histori the best experi that i can give that s sort of an analog is like go to custer s last stand he sai to go and stand where custer stood and imagin you know bad dai to be in the cavalri that s the sens it s your hallow ground you sens crazi hors there and you just realiz the hopeless of the situat well when you re out at the titan and all of a sudden it happen right here it s no longer abstract unknown territori scientif and histor ha been ballard s countri for more than two decad perhap even as far back as hi childhood in southern california when he wa smitten by account of african explor and becam captiv by the pacif ocean now four year after the discoveri of the titan catapult him from mere well known scientist to global fame the 47 year old seem to be in the throe of anoth transform thi time around he appar is eager to shape both the futur and the past with the technolog that he develop in more than a decad of underwat explor furthermor he plan to us hi new tool as the new host of nation geograph explor a weekli two hour program produc by nation geograph and turner broadcast system inc it is the kind of popular of scienc that ballard ha been critic for in the past by hi peer but ballard sai he see hi metamorphosi into tv person as an educ mission that mai help convinc children that scienc is a contact sport discuss the search for the bismarck ballard obvious savor the contact with histori and scienc becaus the bismarck wa engag in a run battl hundr of mile from land when it sank neither the british nor the german were abl or much interest in keep precis record of their locat so ballard s expedit had to search about 150 squar mile of ocean floor initi with sonar and then with remot control computer robot sensor and camera control from a surfac ship befor locat the wreck june 8 thi kind of explor isn t cheap ballard note joke that we had 100 000 pound of equip and 10 van and six robot and a partridg in a pear tree you have to understand that the bismarck battl wa wage in a forc 8 sea 50 knot wind 15 foot wave with overcast and no celesti navig ballard sai the search for the bismarck which like the titan sank on it maiden voyag wa further complic by the natur of the atlant ocean the battleship wa in 16 000 feet of water and it wa in a mountain rang ballard sai not without enthusiasm it wa in an aw place and it wa in the northern latitud up at 48 degre north latitud which is not a nice stretch of ocean ever even in the summer despit the difficulti ballard wa drawn to the wreck becaus like the titan it is on of the most famou lost chunk of histori to litter the ocean floor i do it becaus of the challeng to do it he sai but i m also interest in the fact that thi ship is well preserv there is probabl more histori preserv in the deep ocean of the world than in all the museum of the world although it ha lost it gun turret and wa hit by numer shell and torpedo the bismarck still ha touch of fresh ballard add cite the huge paint swastika on the ship s bow and stern in it dai the 50 000 ton bismarck with heavi armor eight 15 inch gun capabl of fire on ton shell 24 mile and high perform diesel engin wa on of the most power warship afloat and briefli it prove to be just that slip out of it home port of danzig now gdynia on mai 18 1941 to attack alli convoi the bismarck soon had much of the british royal navi look for it at the time england face a victori germani alon and wa depend on convoi from america for most of it food and war materi discov by two british heavi cruiser on mai 23 the bismarck wa engag the next dai by two other british warship from a distanc of 25 000 yard the bismarck s huge shell hit the hood start a fire in an ammunit locker within minut the hood explod kill all but three of the ship s 1 400 crew member the princ of wale wa also damag of the bismarck the british were lucki to get it to the bottom ballard claim in the climact battl a freak hit by a torpedo launch from a vintag world war i biplan knock out the bismarck s steer forc the crippl battleship to wait for the british to come and get it of cours the british came and the bismarck wa sunk in the atlant about 600 mile west of franc sinc the discoveri of the bismarck ballard sai there ha been curios about what actual caus the ship to sink british firepow or scuttl by her own crew but ballard believ the evid make the point moot the british warship had order to sink the bismarck not captur it and the german were under order not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war prize he sai at 10 a m on mai 27 the captain of the bismarck order hi crew to open the seacock on hi disabl ship thu flood the hull ballard recount about 10 30 a m the bismarck wa hit by three torpedo from the british cruiser dorsetshir and sank three minut later bismarck s survivor so it wa on it wai down and the torpedo help but it wa on it wai down ballard sai if thei hadn t open the seacock i m convinc the british would have sat there and plunk torpedo into it until it sank so it s sort of academ who sank it onli about 100 of the bismarck s crew surviv nearli 2 300 perish includ sever hundr who were swim in the water after their ship disappear it is that moment that seem to galvan ballard when the bismarck sank approxim 800 live soul went into the water and were aliv after the ship went under he sai lean forward in hi chair and the dorsetshir came in and began pick up survivor and then someon thought thei saw a periscop and thei took off and thei left 700 peopl in the water aliv can you imagin the aw the hopeless the despair of the sailor who s just had a ship blown out from underneath him he s paddl and freez to death in thi water and salvat is right there and he s grab hold of the hull and the ship take off ballard ha said he will not reveal the exact locat of the bismarck except to german author as a ship of war the battleship belong to germani he sai although there might be some debat about which half of that divid countri would have the more legitim claim as with the titan ballard sai he strongli believ that such rel recent wreck should be left undisturb memori to those who perish as for wreck from the dim reach of the past ballard argu that thei should be explor onli by qualifi archeologist intent on broaden histor knowledg in fact he still becom visibl angri that privat expedit to the titan took some artifact from the wreck develop deep sea robot but ballard seem to be chiefli an enthusiast not a critic in particular he is a propon of machin especi robot ballard ha head up the develop of a system of deep sea unman robot call the argo jason system equip with camera and other sens devic the robot ar now capabl of plumb the world s deep water faster and more safe than the tini slow man submarin that previous were the cut edg of ocean research and explor he sai while an unman robot name jason jr wa us in a 1986 expedit to the titan it wa onli within the last few month that the leap wa made to fulli robot explor ballard sai mean that robot can now be direct from a surfac ship rather than from a man submarin via a control cabl it s a relief that he and other won t have to spend five or more hour per dai commut to the ocean floor which averag 12 000 feet in depth he sai even though he ha spent a lot of time in cramp research submarin and probabl will spend more ballard is mif by the ineffici of the romant littl gui refer to the small submarin he explain you re spend five hour a dai freez to death in thi littl sphere our averag dive time on the titan wa three hour a dai three hour out of 24 and you ve got 50 peopl and you ve got on gui look out of a window more interest in scienc ballard ha been talk about the potenti of thi technolog for year but recent advanc have made him more convinc than ever that the concept of telepres will revolution not onli undersea explor but the wai mani peopl travel more import he see the technolog as capabl of rekindl interest in scienc among american schoolchildren we re now reach a point in technolog in imag devic both acoust and visual fiber optic

where i don t feel profession inconvenienc by live in montana how much time he actual will spend in northern montana is an open question though given the demand of the explor televis seri with the

the sea 70 of the planet s under water we ve seen less than 1 of 1 i mean we know more about the mountain rang on mar than the mountain rang of our own planet he sai the vast unknown it is thi sens of

scientist who have been frustrat for decad by their inabl to place perman seismic and oceanograph monitor station on the ocean floor ar on the brink of realiz their dream by us transocean telephon cabl that have outliv their origin purpos on thursdai at t and it japanes counterpart kokusai denshin denwa ltd will donat part of the first cabl system to span the pacif to two scientif organ that plan to us it to suppli electr and a commun link to ocean floor system in the western pacif the vital link which ha been replac by a fiber optic system will allow scientist for the first time to instal perman seismic monitor station on the ocean floor between guam and japan eventu scientist hope to extend the program as other cabl becom avail there s a great deal of excit over the potenti of the program said rhett butler a seismologist with the incorpor research institut for seismolog iri of arlington va on of the organ that will receiv titl to part of the tran pacif cabl next month the institut which coordin seismic research for 70 us colleg and univers will be join in the program by the earthquak research institut of the univers of tokyo it s a tremend opportun for scientist said alan chave an oceanograph with at t s bell laboratori the cost of lai cabl across the ocean is so great that we could never possibl do it for scientif purpos alon he said but sinc the cabl ar there alreadi thei provid a chanc to creat a true global network of monitor station at a bargain basement price for the first time scientist will be abl to studi offshor seismic activ on a continu basi includ movement along fault chang in the contour of the ocean floor that could indic an immin quak and electromagnet emiss from the earth befor and dure quak the program could also aid research in a number of other area that ar global in scope oceanograph applic hold great promis for such area as global chang in the ocean environ a matter of concern to scientist who fear that the planet mai be warm becaus of the greenhous effect the onli wai to find out if that is true chave said is to monitor the entir planet simultan and collect data continu over a period of mani year on crucial tool in that effort could be the cabl that ar be abandon around the world the program is so new that no price tag ha been set yet but scientist believ thei have come across a resourc that is so valuabl it cannot be wast thi will give the cabl anoth life after retir from telephon us said butler in most case the cabl ar in extrem good shape although the link between california and hawaii wa somehow sever off the coast of california about a year ago that cabl could still be usabl from hawaii to the point where it is broken near the california coast and it could eventu be reconnect to the mainland if that prove worthwhil except for that problem the tran pacif cabl is just about as good as it wa when it wa first put down in the earli 1960s said bell s chave the cabl should be us for at least anoth 20 year he ad chave said the cabl can provid three thing for scienc a line to transmit power to ocean floor instrument a commun link to extract data immedi from those station and an abil to oper a wide rang of instrument remot we can t do ani of those without the cabl he said histor scientist were abl to put instrument in the sea for up to two year but the life of the instrument wa limit by their batteri and it wa not possibl to retriev data as it wa collect and eventu you have to drive a ship out there and pick it up chave said all of that add to the cost and reduc the effect and it creat gap in the data dure a workshop on scientif us of undersea cabl in hawaii earlier thi year junzo kasahara of the univers of tokyo singl out the primari problem in todai s research when he note that scientif data is collect unequ over the earth becaus two third of the planet is cover by ocean and littl data is collect there we have estim the natur of the earth us these incomplet data kasahara told the workshop retir undersea telephon cabl could help fill those gap by allow scientist to put perman facil on the floor of the ocean and collect data as it is gener that is particularli import in seismic research becaus scientist gener see onli the part of the pictur that happen on land right now there is a huge gap said butler who ha been activ in the effort to convert the cabl for sever year he note that there ar mani seismic station in california but onc you leav the coast the next station is in hawaii there ar still mani bug includ financ to be work out howev bell s chave said the biggest problem is find a wai to instal instrument along the cabl at a reason cost when at t crew need to instal repeat for instanc thei did it by cut the cabl lift both end to the surfac and splice their equip into it that s half a million dollar a pop he said and that kind of monei is hard to come by in scientif circl so the program is expect to get off to a slow start and will initi be center in the seismic activ zone between guam and japan us particip hope to build the equip in guam that will power the instrument at a cost of sever hundr thousand dollar butler said the system wa design to transmit power from guam not japan and it is not revers he ad japan plan to instal three station on the sea floor two of those will be pure for the studi of seismic phenomena such as the propag of seismic wave along the ocean floor after an earthquak the third will also includ electromagnet and oceanograph sensor to monitor such thing as chang in water temperatur and electromagnet signal emit by the earth befor and dure earthquak chave said there is also consider interest in a cabl that stretch from rhode island to spain becaus that could monitor the atlant includ a giant geolog structur call the mid atlant ridg that bisect the ocean floor and mark the area where the tecton plate ar pull apart that cabl will becom avail in 1993 there ar go to be a lot of opportun come up like thi in the next 10 year chave said the incorpor research institut for seismolog is put togeth a propos for fund from the nation scienc foundat although the biggest cost of the project ha alreadi been paid by the compani that instal the cabl it will not be cheap to build sophist ocean floor system and instal them chave said sever cost cut concept ar be studi includ the instal of junction box along the cabl that would requir a on time splice into the cabl for each box and instrument could be ad at ani time by simpli plug them in and wai will have to be found to attach the instrument firmli to the ocean floor so that such thing as seismomet will not be confus by current and shift in the mud at the bottom of the sea the program is so new that there is no consensu on how those object would best be met but us scientist believ thei will be abl to learn much at bargain basement price in the initi effort becaus the govern of japan plan to spend 10 million on the three ocean floor station far more than the us oblig sinc the power to run the cabl between guam and japan must origin in guam it will be up to american scientist to provid that at a cost far less than the japanes invest in the program in exchang us scientist will share fulli in the research and result from the japanes station thi is an instanc where we can learn a great deal about work with cabl for veri littl monei said chave the japanes ar budget 10 million if we can learn whether thi is worth do for the cost of provid the facil in guam then it s a good deal seismic research network telephon cabl that span much of the world s ocean will becom avail for other us within thi decad and scientist hope to see at least some of them to run seismic and oceanograph instrument on the ocean floor thi map show cabl that ar expect to be replac by fiber optic system by the end of thi centuri part of a cabl that link the unit state and japan will be turn over to research organ on nov 1 that cabl run
