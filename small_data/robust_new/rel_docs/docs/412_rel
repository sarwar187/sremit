other word with regard to the topic under discuss it task is to depriv air carrier of oper licens on behalf of the state if thei do not meet flight safeti standard set by the state the chao in the russian aviat industri begin with the statutori legal basi of thi function which is perform by the state or the lack of it in our countri regardless of whether the former ussr ministri of civil aviat

entitl to suspend the oper of aircraft airfield and airport when it discov shortcom that threaten their safeti but what doe is entitl to actual mean oblig to would be clear a danger ha been discov do

a 24 hour stopov at the same airport would cost a foreign compani fly an equival aircraft just 77 have listen to a number of pilot i am fairli skeptic when i hear their tale about the dire econom
