nation academi of scienc describ indoor air pollut as a potenti signific human health problem it call for a wide rang research effort but it wasn t until 1985 that the magnitud of the indoor pollut threat becam readili appar a five year epa studi survei 600 individu in six citi to find out what their exposur wa to 20 differ chemic some of which have been link with cancer and birth defect research were startl by the find it did not matter whether the studi particip live in the lo angel area next to an oil refineri or in a pristin rural set indoor concentr of the 20 chemic compound studi were almost alwai higher often by as much as 10 time or more than thei were outdoor peak concentr in some home were 200 to 500 time higher than outdoor indoor sourc blood sampl and breath test reveal that particip from rural area were burden with as much chemic contamin in their system as urban dweller a fact that research said could onli point to indoor sourc of pollut common in everi household the studi s find left question that must still be resolv ar higher exposur indoor necessarili danger what ar the cumul and synergist effect if ani of simultan exposur to more than 600 compound from build materi and household product found in home ar health risk too high or ar thei compar to everydai risk that most peopl take for grant like drive on a freewai will seriou health

that most human experi indoor ar also harm what is clear is that the elderli young children and those who suffer from respiratori problem or ar chemic sensit ar particularli vulner to indoor contamin studi in the unit state and britain have found for exampl that children who ar expos to elev level of nitrogen dioxid a combust product emit by kerosen heater and ga applianc had more than twice the

known human carcinogen ha been found in far higher concentr indoor than outdoor in lo angel the epa found that 71 2 of exposur to benzen occur indoor benzen is emit by synthet fiber plastic and some

benzen in their breath two to five hour after fill up the ga tank as 300 other particip who did not fill their own tank but wallac ad that the most import exposur to benzen is cigarett cigarett smoke benzen level in home with smoker were 30 to 50 higher than in nonsmok household smoker and those around them ar expos to an estim 4 600 chemic constitu in cigarett smoke a number of them cancer caus variou studi have estim that environment tobacco smoke mai account for upward of 5 000 death a year among nonsmok inde epa scientist jame l repac ha said that the risk of indoor air pollut from tobacco smoke to nonsmok ar almost twice as great as from radon ga and more than a hundr time as great as the total death rate from all cancer caus hazard outdoor air pollut regul by the epa under the clean air act scientist have note that a 1985 studi publish by the american journal of public health show signific increas in death due to leukemia and lymphoma among peopl who were expos as children to parent smoke each year there ar 200 000 emerg room admiss due to allergi and a third of them ar believ to be caus by microbiolog contamin found indoor accord to burg the director of the univers of
