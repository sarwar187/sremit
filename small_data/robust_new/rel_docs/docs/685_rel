15 000 word profil in new yorker magazin and there were those in hollywood who thought he might becom the first person to receiv a best director nomin for a documentari but when the oscar nomin were announc last month the name of morri and the thin blue line were nowher to be found a fact that shock critic and finlm maker alik it is on of the most outrag thing in the modern histori of the academi said english director michael apt who ha made both featur coal miner s daughter gorilla in the mist and documentari 28 up for my monei it wa the best piec of film in ani categori that thei ignor it diminish the academi film critic roger ebert who list morri 1979 gate of heaven as on of the 10 best film ever made call the slight of the thin blue line the worst non nomin of the year and attribut it reject to the inabl of academi voter to appreci innov film make if morri had done a 60 minut documentari with talk head film clip and convent narrat thei would have nomin it ebert said perhap thei would have in interview with sever of the 40 member of the academi s documentari committe the film s style it blend of interview reenact and fetishist like close up of polic light pistol and other murder scene object wa often mention as be off put i think thi is a case of the emperor ha no cloth said on documentari film maker on the committe i wa shock that the film had gotten all that attent and my own evalu wa so differ the critic accolad were stunningli differ from what i observ from interview done for thi stori it doesn t appear that the thin blue line even came close to receiv a nomin all but on of the member interview said thei did not consid it on of the five best film thei saw in fact at the committe screen of the thin blue line enough member rais their hand to have the film stop befor it wa complet it is a common democrat procedur committe member explain to have a film turn off when enough of them request it it is a process that on member describ as dump someth that occur frequent when there s a heavi workload arthur nadel chairman of the academi s documentari committe said 74 film were submit thi year ad up to between 100 and 150 hour of view if each on wa plai to the end how much of the thin blue line did the committe see befor thei dump it it wa 85 of the wai through on member in attend that night said some of us stai and thei show the rest of it but it s unfair to sai the other might have vote differ if thei d watch it all the film wa not like chuck workman whose preciou imag won him an oscar in 1986 in the short film live action categori said he consid the thin blue line on of the best film of the year and that he wa surpris it did not get nomin but workman said he did not think there wa anyth polit in the reject there is veri littl polit involv in that group he said thei have mind of their own and vote the wai thei see it a lot of peopl just didn t like the movi nomin for documentari both short and featur involv preliminari and final vote after each screen member evalu the film on a scale of 4 to 10 and jot their rate down in booklet that remain with the academi after thei ve seen all of the submit film thei get togeth for a dai to discuss what thei ve seen we argu and lobbi each other on member said then thei vote again onli the final vote which ar turn over immedi to price waterhous count vote for the actual oscar is done by all academi member who valid their attend at screen of all five nomine at thi year s wrap up nomin meet the thin blue line wa hardli discuss member sai it wa discuss onli in the sens that there wa so much neg feel about it workman said it wa pretti much dismiss so how doe a film steamrol critic woo audienc the thin blue line gross 1 5 million which is consid good for a documentari and get a warm recept on newspap op ed page onli to feel an arctic breez emerg from the academi theori abound the film had too much public it wa overhyp by the distributor and set itself up for a fall miramax film which hold the worldwid theatric and videocassett right to it push too hard in it academi award campaign in suggest it in trade ad for consider as both best pictur and best documentari featur it sent a signal to the committe member that the film wa worthi of more than thei could give it the film wa too slick it had too much product for it own good the academi voter ar too old and too narrow in their view of documentari to accept morri innov style and mani of them do not have the expertis to judg the committe member who did not vote for the thin blue line dismiss all of these notion i think the distributor set the film up as a shoo in and that it creat an expect among member that the film couldn t meet said mitchel block whose direct cinema distribut documentari but there wa no backlash as a group we simpli thought the five nomin film were better as for the critic block said thei have no caus for outrag how can thei sai thin blue line is the best documentari of the year when thei haven t even seen the five that were nomin thei can sai rain man is the best movi if thei ve seen all the featur but thei can t sai thei know better than we do if thei haven t seen what we ve seen ebert conced that point to block but won t conced to those member who said film critic get caught up in the emot of a movi and overlook it structur flaw there is a strong impuls in america to want a movi to tell a stori with none of the stylist element to distract you ebert said we now have all these movi that ar total narr peopl ar resist to movi like the thin blue line that break that narr reveri i think that s what happen in that committe the makeup of the documentari committe is cite by some as it strength and by other as it weak we have produc director camera peopl actor film editor all kind of extraordinari talent who have the dedic to commit to see all these film said chairman nadel thei bring a lot of knowledg to the nomin process workman said he believ the committe would be more effect if it makeup were less heterogen i think the intent of everyon on the committe ar veri good he said their tast ar their own and not necessarili enlighten i just wish there were more film maker involv the committe is compos of academi member who volunt for the job and ar then select by the chairman nadel who took over from norman corwin last year will not discuss committe membership but other member estim that more than half ar older than 65 and that there ar onli four who ar under 50 on other theori rais to explain the fate of the thin blue line is that it wa a victim of time becaus it wa on of the last of the 74 film shown to the committe mayb the member were too weari to give it the attent it need the last 10 minut of the movi includ what amount to a confess by the real killer yet enough member at the committe screen appar were readi to stop the film befor there wa a hint of the third act revel nadel would not comment on how or why film ar stop but two member emphas that the decis to dump is democrat impli that if on more than 50 of the viewer rais their hand the projector is turn off in ani event when the hand went up at the screen of the thin blue line there wa appar no opposit morri who is in lo angel attempt to parlai the success of the thin blue line into a featur film assign refus to be drawn into the oscar debat sai he had receiv hi award when the texa appeal court overturn the convict of randal adam my main concern from the begin ha been to get randal adam out of prison morri said what thi film ha done for me ha been enorm the fact that i ve been involv in a case like thi and have had an impact on it ha been reward enough nevertheless morri acknowledg that it would have been nice to stand befor the world and thank the peopl who made it possibl sue weil at pb who believ in me and the project and found a wai to keep us go when no on els wa will lindsai law at american playhous who got involv and made it possibl for me to do the re enact to hire compos philip glass and turn the interview materi into a movi morri who ha work as a privat investig between documentari said he and randal adam ar ahead of the game that he s got a new leas on hi film career and adam a new leas on life but that s not enough for those peopl who think their victori should have been toast with an oscar hi film is as good a look at that part of america as i have ever seen said director michael apt point out that the academi bestow a batch of nomin seven on mississippi burn while ignor a documentari that put the spotlight on a more recent exampl of southern injustic it s shame that fellow member in the industri don t give it the acknowledg it deserv the final upshot of the thin blue line the overturn convict came after the oscar nomin were announc workman wonder how hi colleagu on the committe felt as thei read the front page new stori about that rule i think those peopl ar embarrass now workman said wouldn t it be nice if everi time you see the randal adam case mention it sai the academi award nomin film but anoth member seem to be speak for the major when he said i m thrill that an innoc man is go to get out of jail but
