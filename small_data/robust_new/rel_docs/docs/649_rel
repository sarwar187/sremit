FBIS3-40468: languag japanes articl type cso text special issu secur lan network os and open system the trend toward open system should be welcom by user howev these kind of open network can also expos import busi inform to danger thi is becaus lan host and server can be easili access from outsid the compani secur can be guarante for the most part by us the built in function of network oper system and by us techniqu at the oper level product which supplement the area of weak ar come onto the market howev when secur is strengthen there is concern that the origin flexibl of an open system mai be lost part 1 the rapid increas of danger network link techniqu which center on lan such as tcp ip netwar and lan manag etc ar bring about the construct of a truli user friendli environ howev the down side to increas the degre of freedom is that thi so call open is creat secur problem a varieti of program and databas on person comput lan server unix machin and mainfram can be access through lan howev there is a grow danger that sensit and confidenti inform mai be leak by unauthor peopl access and view it mr hajim iwasawa chief inspector of the kyowa hakko industri compani s inform system depart sai there continu to be about 10 instanc of access by unknown parti at kyowa employe can access the intern compani system from outsid locat through a subscrib phone network a vax which is link

randomli view the vax surveil termin a log in show a connect log in failur wa displai mr iwasawa said as a result we do not know who that person wa it mai have been an employe who actual fail to get on but there is no guarante of that becaus it wa randomli view on the surveil termin who it wa could be discov becaus thei ar not alwai check the log oper there mai be other time when access is gain by unknown parti there wa a recent incid of a comput viru infect at the nation cancer center the viru invad nearli 200 machin includ nec pc 9800s appl macintosh and ibm pc the tip of the arrow began with the us of refer search and electron mail by a netwar person comput lan fortun the viru wa simpli on that made a sound and loss were minim later the sourc wa found out becaus it wa from a person comput infect by a viru that had record it id etc a viru that invad becaus of a littl careless and spread throughout an entir compani is not that rare both of these exampl involv a process that occur in an open inform system and thi make it necessari to reconsid secur measur in convent host termin system who can enter is determin natur howev in open system it is easi to connect with the network we must be abl to determin who mai not enter sai mr iwasawa of kyowa hakko the number of busi connect to network is grow secur is compromis by creat an open system with downsiz and the creation of open system inform is expect to be liber from a close world an environ is grow in which it is easi to connect to everyth from person comput to mainfram person person comput lan network oper system no such as netwar from novel and lan manag from microsoft ar reinforc thi open and standard protocol repres by tcp ip ar be support mainfram also permit tcp ip connect and thi set up an environ that can be connect from top to bottom the number of person comput termin which can link up to network is grow and inform resourc such as access program and databas ar expand and diversifi a person comput link to a lan creat an environ in which it is possibl to access inform that can be physic locat anywher on the other hand network infrastructur which have thi kind of flexibl and exapand carri with them the weak of be vulner to extern enemi thei ar easi to us but thei ar fragil in relat to unauthor access and acquisit of inform nearli the entir structur is open to the outsid and thi creat an environ that fall easi prei to unauthor activ guarante that a user is author is difficult for a long time system have tri to verifi who the user is when the host system is access in the log in procedur the host side verifi that it is the correct user by have the user input an id name and password the procedur for confirm the user by id name and password is the same in the world of person comput lan and unix in almost all case of confirm whether or not a user is author the id and password ar all there is in a typic lan system if an id and password ar us the program and databas can be access from virtual anywher thi practic receiv high mark from the point of view of conveni howev if the id and password ar leak that s all there is there have even been extrem exampl when the id and password were written on a memo past on the person comput that kind of loos manag permit unauthor us and easi intrus into the system it is also possibl to make a program that tri to gain access by substitut the password with pc lan server access control function ar provid which can stipul the rang of program or databas that can be access from the termin of each user the place where the control rang is determin howev is the user id if the id and password ar stolen the control lose all mean by open a system mainfram util ar on just step awai onc a mainfram is open up secur check becom a whole level softer convention independ address were set to each individu termin and the connect between the host and the termin wa made by built in coaxial cabl or by a dedic us line specif a on to on correspond wa establish between the commun port of the host and the termin even in public network relai such as subscrib telephon network termin address ar incorpor into independ procedur thu these could not be call the world of easi access by id and password alon for exampl even if the id and password ar found out access cannot be made through a differ termin there ar also instanc when the menu itself is vari as the protocol move from individu to open the circumst chang a gatewai is offer by which mainfram and third parti can access the host by tcp ip from pc etc howev when tcp ip is us unless special techniqu ar emploi the host cannot discrimin between termin the connect of the tcp ip open protocol impli that a termin address for individu manufactur cannot be implant all that can be request is an id and a password and seen from the convent vantag point secur is lax data can be easili stolen there is the possibl of steal data in a lan system all data run on cabl between node that ar link by segment even if access right ar restrict by id and password thi inform can be view and stolen sai kazu sugiyama team leader of the technolog develop depart system busi depart catena for exampl by take the electr signal out from the cabl at the circuit board and convert them to data the data can be view on the monitor if a lan manag analyz is us it is even more simpl lan analyz ar conveni system when analyz traffic condit and breakdown but in fact data can be seen if an analyz system is instal in a pc which is connect to the lan data can be stolen right from there some inform such as personnel inform should not even be seen by peopl within the compani with an analyz thi also is not difficult to see furthermor if the id and password that ar necessari to verifi the user ar stolen the consequ can be grave there is therefor a function to scrambl password data in the no of such system as netwar and lan manag so the password cannot be easili stolen unix system do not have thi function howev it is easi to have unauthor access without leav evid behind an issu that must be rais in pc lan and unix system is that no evid of oper and process remain behind indic jiju tabuchi manag of the softwar busi divis inform system busi depart fujitsu after an incid ha occur a mainfram can follow who did what oper thi techniqu can be us to stop unauthor access the log function ar weak howev in a pc lan or unix system in which a supervisor super user can easili do anyth if no log ha been done then no prior caus can be specifi unprotect network ar hotb for virus accord to the number of report case of viru damag tabul by the ipa inform process associ the number of case jump from 57 in 1991 to 229 in 1992 these number probabl repres just the tip of the iceberg believ norio yuto director of the ipa technolog center comput viru technolog survei laboratori busi ar appear that will provid gener secur servic against the kind of viru that konica suffer thi is becaus it is expect that the number of damag virus will increas in the futur as network becom more widespread thei will becom hotb for comput virus virus ar destruct program that becom incorpor into ordinari program and the entranc wai for virus increas with the spread of network there is the fear that onc thei invad thei can be transmit to the entir system befor anyon realiz it if a viru enter a jointli
