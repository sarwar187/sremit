graduat school of journal if what gilbert said wa the case then you could basic shut down courtroom to report by have them subpoena other attornei call for comment on media coverag of the case howev said the real problem with media coverag of big court case such as johnson s is the tendenc of report to reli on materi gather on the courthous step instead of insid the courtroom thi practic is especi common in televis and in case when report or camera ar bar from the courtroom but sourc said the practic allow and even encourag lawyer to try their case on nation televis when somebodi goe out on the courthous step what thei re give you is not a fact it s their own opinion and you gui should realli be report the fact said robert j perri who prosecut former auto maker john z delorean on cocain charg and is now a partner at epstein becker mulkeen green in lo angel the reason the media is easili manipul is it s faster and easier to have someon els particularli a particip to summar the event for you and that is the blur of fact and opinion that pervert the content of the report if legal maneuv is so complex that report do need help in interpret event perri said thei would do better to get a quicki opinion from an object third parti than from the attornei try the case the delorean case wa consid a mileston in media coverag of trial becaus delorean s defens attornei howard l

interview weitzman a partner at wyman bautzer kuchel silbert in lo angel said he believ there is noth wrong with a lawyer try to correct public mispercept about hi client i do think it s inappropri to get person with the other side and i do think it s inappropri to try on s case in the media weitzman said defin the latter as present fact to the press befor thei ar introduc in court what i have real troubl with is creat the media interest said weitzman who said he would not send out a press releas about a case befor it is file weitzman said the media were drawn to the delorean case becaus the auto maker wa alreadi a celebr the lawyer should not be gener the public the lawyer should be respond to the media s and the public s need for inform when lawyer do take their case to the press it is usual to counter damag done by polic prosecutor or the other side or to prevent their client from win the court case but lose in the court of public opinion sometim it is a veil attempt to influenc a
