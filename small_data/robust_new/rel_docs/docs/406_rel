princip investig of the new studi the new result ar veri import said neurologist stanlei fahn of the columbia univers colleg of physician and surgeon co chairman of a larger studi of deprenyl call datatop that is now under wai at 28 clinic center throughout the countri langston s studi serv as a pilot program for datatop result from the larger studi ar not expect until late 1990 at the earliest and fahn refus to comment on them but rumor circul in the neurolog commun suggest that those result will support langston s find and langston s result could have an immedi impact on treatment of parkinson s in thi countri six week ago the us food and drug administr approv market of deprenyl for us in combin with l dopa for treat patient late in the cours of parkinson s somerset pharmaceut of denvil nj will begin market the drug as eldepryl in mid septemb and onc thei do physician as thei mai with ani drug will be free to prescrib it for ani us thei see fit fahn note that it is inevit that larg number of neurologist will jump on it deprenyl for their patient in the earli stage of the diseas parkinson s diseas result from the death of cell in the substantia nigra portion of the brain that secret the neural transmitt dopamin which plai a kei role in the control of muscl movement the diseas s caus is unknown but grow number of neurologist believ that it is produc by chemic in the environ that poison the dopamin secret cell as product of dopamin is slow the victim lose control of their limb until thei eventu becom complet disabl l dopa is us in therapi becaus it is convert into dopamin in the brain increas the brain s dopamin suppli but it is effect on averag for onli about six year after which symptom worsen some research have attempt to cure parkinson s by transplant dopamin secret cell from the adren gland or from fetus into the brain of victim but those procedur have been attempt on onli about 300 patient and there is still no consensu on their valu in contrast deprenyl could be us with virtual everi parkinson s patient for their studi langston and neurologist jame w tetrud recruit 54 patient who had recent been found to have parkinson s diseas half were given twice daili dose of deprenyl and half were given a placebo a sugar pill with no effect the patient were monitor until either thei had been in the studi for three year or their condit becam sever enough to requir l dopa thei found that the averag time befor l dopa wa requir wa 312 dai in the placebo group and 549 dai in the deprenyl group langston and tetrud also rate the patient neurolog condit on five separ scale thei found that base on these scale diseas progress wa slow by 40 to 83 per year the clinic observ suggest that the diseas is progress more slowli and that s compel evid but it is not proof langston said in an interview to prove it we would have to demonstr that nerv cell ar surviv over time a procedur that is not current possibl in live human at the end of the studi the patient were taken off deprenyl for a month to ensur that the appar slowdown in diseas progress wa due to the preserv of nerv cell and not simpli to relief of symptom the drug therapi wa then restart and the research will continu to monitor the patient to determin whether the drug continu it effect for longer period iron deprenyl ha been us in europ for about 15 year to treat patient who have begun to develop toler for the effect of l dopa in on kei studi pharmacologist moussa bh youdim of the technion israel institut of technolog found that combin us of l dopa and deprenyl substanti increas the surviv of parkinson s victim but that studi wa view with a great deal of skeptic accord to ucla neurologist charl h markham becaus it wa an uncontrol studi on an unusu group of parkinson s patient langston s result howev would seem to provid strong support for youdim s conclus the 10 million datatop studi ha a design similar to langston and tetrud s but involv 800 patient some of those patient ar also receiv vitamin e as well as deprenyl howev to determin whether vitamin e can also slow the diseas as anim experi have suggest if the datatop result confirm langston and tetrud s fahn said research will almost certainli begin studi the long term combin effect of l dopa and deprenyl to determin if peopl will in fact live longer parkinson s drug parkinson s diseas is caus by the death of cell in the substantia nigra at the base of the brain that releas a hormon necessari for control muscl movement mount evid indic that metabolit of environment chemic such as pesticid can kill the cell caus the diseas the drug deprenyl delai the progress of parkinson s by block convers of the chemic into their toxic form
