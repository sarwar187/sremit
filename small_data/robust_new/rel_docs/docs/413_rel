base on micro test piec the size of micro test piec us for materi strength evalu is between 0 1 and sever millimet which is far smaller than the test piec us for convent strength evalu in gener strength properti correspond to the size of test piec therefor it is often not advantag to us test piec whose size is far smaller than the real part of the structur in question in realiti of cours smaller test piec ar gener us for econom reason therefor standard test method ar design includ the size of test piec to elimin the problem deriv from the reduct of size the size of the micro test piec us for materi strength evalu is rather small consid the scale of the part of the structur in spite of the problem caus by such a gap far smaller test piec ar us for the follow reason i thei ar essenti if an acceler type neutron sourc is to be us ii the amount of radiat is restrict even with nuclear fission reactor irradi iii the size of part us in the equip in question have becom smaller point i and ii ar requir for nuclear fusion reactor materi develop as describ in the previou chapter an acceler type neutron sourc is propos as the radiat sourc for materi test becaus it can approxim the condit of a neutron environ and the amount of radiat there is extrem small furthermor practic the onli irradi equip that can be us for the develop of nuclear fusion reactor materi is the high flux isotop reactor hfir at oak ridg nation laboratori ornl the maximum volum that can be irradi there is onli 100 cc and thu the reduct of the size of test piec is signific the item iii ha refer to the fact that minimum measur such as the thick of the part to be us in a fusion reactor is onli sever millimet and thu thei ar often small part rather than larg structur such as pressur vessel furthermor as the size of the equip us in the newer light water reactor such as abwr and apwr ha becom smaller it is necessari to pai attent to new kind of damag that mai be differ from convent type unlik i and ii thi is an extens of the thought that test is to be conduct in condit that approxim the condit of the real machin materi in seek to extend the life time of light water reactor data on the materi strength deriv from part of the real structur mai contribut to improv evalu accuraci then iii will respond to such a need befor a piec of equip and the materi that compos it can be put to us under

convent test method for instanc it is difficult to evalu the fractur tough of materi us for thin wall equip when us a test method base on linear fractur mechan reduc the size of test piec will also contribut to a reduct of radioact materi the us of small test piec and micro test piec in irradi test to evalu the strength of materi creat problem in term of measur effect on test piec as well as the handl of test piec which mai be too small for the manipul measur effect can be dealt with as follow 1 to discov the rang with smaller effect 2 to formul the measur effect and 3 to obtain onli rel relationship within the same test also the test method is design to reduc measur effect with regard to elast and plastic properti materi and test piec measur often fit into case 1 howev as thi is difficult to determin logic for the time be judgment must be made on the basi of comparison with the state of distort in individu case and result from test us rel larg piec irradi often result in a stiffen of the materi thi is due to the gener of a number of group of micro defect on the order of 1 m or less by irradi the gener of such group of micro defect tend to reduc measur effect as far as plastic behavior is concern in contrast raptur properti affect measur effect and these can be realist treat with 2 and 3 concern fatigu behavior there ar some result that indic that certain condit will reduc measur effect although the format effect ar larger in some case handl technolog ha been develop by produc remot control equip the follow is a descript of the equip that ha been develop for test equip we will describ equip for small punch test and tension test as well as test equip to obtain dbtt by trim becaus handl technolog for test piec is import test piec handl equip and test piec process equip will be introduc as test piec or a test piec materi test piec for the transmiss electron microscop tem test piec 3 x 0 25 mmt ar us the reason for thi select is that in spite of the

holder and tension small scale tension test for micro test piec first we will describ sp test thi is a type of bulg test in which the test piec is deform while it is in a state of two spindl tension therefor multipl spindl stress can be increas distort bind becom larger compar to tension test and a reduct of the measur effect can be expect therefor it is said that properti valu correspond to the fractur tough valu can be obtain from rel small piec thi method ha been appli at the am research laboratori in the unit state tohoku univers and jaeri in sp test the relationship of deflect between load and the test piec is obtain as illustr in figur vii 2 13 thi relationship of deflect consist of four distort step these ar the elast distort stage the plastic distort stage the plastic film extens stage and the plastic instabl stage in the order of less distort in the plastic instabl stage the load increas for the distort is reduc and the load is reduc sharpli when raptur final occur in part of the test piec concern materi properti stress at yield of the materi can be estim from the condit of transit from the elast distort stage to the plastic bend stage and the fractur tough valu can be estim from the energi spent for distort until raptur occur correspond to the area confin by the load distort curv or sp energi or the draw valu of the raptur section to be measur after test figur vii 2 14 illustr the relationship between the sp energi obtain from the same materi and the jc valu obtain in the standard fractur tough test becaus materi that present brashi ductil transit for

method is higher than that of the sp test howev there wa almost no differ in temperatur between the two type of materi in thi test method although there wa a differ of about 80 c in the standard

evalu the reliabl of plant effect simul requir an analysi of the damag mechan of structur and materi which in turn depend on basic materi research includ design test item and measur method the oper condit for structur materi for new type of reactor in particular ar affect by unpreced damag due to compound mechan such mechan includ high energi neutron high temperatur corros stress and vibrat therefor unless the behavior of materi is fulli assess by basic research and experi evalu the reliabl of plant could prove to be difficult furthermor as plant ar requir to have a high level of reliabl a basic examin is necessari even for item among compound oper that ar normal free from interact and thu seem less problemat therefor it will becom necessari to devis ad hoc evalu test on variou item the follow present some perspect on the develop of materi test in the futur take as an exampl the develop of structur materi for nuclear fusion reactor the materi us to blanket nuclear fusion reactor ar expos to intens irradi 30 dpa at the experiment reactor and over 100 dpa at the demonstr reactor by high energi 14 mev neutron in addit thei also receiv chemic effect from light water and liquid

FBIS4-27797: cso articl by toru nagai daiwa research institut blast furnac industri to have hard time extric itself from iron steel recess will be press to special in profit varieti text the desper struggl of the blast furnac industri which had held the posit of japan s kei industri continu it is certain that the five major compani will have their first ordinari loss in seven year the situat is seriou becaus of such thing as a declin in demand for iron and steel and an offens by electr furnac it is even possibl that it will trod the same path as the us blast furnac industri more seriou than dure the strong yen recess it is estim that japan s total product of crude steel in fy93 will be about 96 6 million ton 2 5 percent less than the previou year fall below 100 million ton for two year in a row for the first time sinc sinc the oil shock it is expect that a further declin in product volum will be unavoid in fy94 as well and the outlook is for it to fall to the 1970 level of 91 million ton a declin of about 20 percent from fy90 the most recent peak under these circumst the slump in busi result of the major blast furnac compani which have led japan s iron and steel industri is strike it is certain that the profit and loss of major blast furnac compani for the march 1994 period will declin to the first real loss in seven year moreov ordinari loss on a real base not count profit on secur sold is expect to total 280 billion yen y for the five major compani furthermor becaus of a declin in sale volum and so on it is veri possibl that the margin of loss will widen to top y360 billion in the next period thi is a level which rival the period of the strong yen recess which wa call an iron chill on can sai that we ar encount what is truli a second iron chill by simpl calcul if thi loss were to continu for the next five year some of the major blast furnac compani would certainli fall into excess debt if it er in it respons it manag base would probabl be lost even if it were iron and steel compani which have long reign as the essenc of japan s manufactur industri practic speak the possibl that thi scenario will becom a realiti is by no mean slight thi is becaus the condit surround the present iron and steel industri ar more seriou than those dure the strong yen recess first of all there can be cite the fact that there is alreadi littl room for ration at product site much wa adjust consider dure the strong yen recess so thing have progress to a stage where it will be imposs to make product more effici unless there is some technolog innov furthermor there is also the fact that such diversif sector as semiconductor and leisur industri in which a great deal of capit ha been invest by the steel compani dure the period of prosper after 1987 have not yet produc conspicu posit result but convers ar weigh on them as burden of larg fix expens and on can probabl sai that anoth reason is that in both domest and foreign demand it is difficult to find a scenario for recoveri of demand for steel product becaus at a time when adjust of stock is continu under asset deflat employ uncertainti ha also becom seriou so for the time be it is difficult to anticip expans of consumpt or of plant and equip invest in addit difficult to handl structur problem have arisen which ar more import than thi kind of problem thei ar the follow three point first that a differ between foreign and domest price ha becom constant second a larg gap exist between suppli and demand and third the rise of electr furnac these problem which began to surfac in the iron chill ar becom a new weight on major blast furnac compani in addit to have negat the benefit of cheap raw materi through it indirect effect a declin in proce from export sale and a reduct in domest product of car and electr machineri which ar major user of steel product it is natur that the strong yen would put pressur on iron and steel industri earn howev it is more import that the unjustifi strength of the yen sinc the plaza accord is produc a long term differ between foreign and domest price of steel materi if on look at japanes and us price for steel materi convert at the market exchang rate the averag market for hot coil steel over the last five year ha been about 560 per ton in japan in contrast to 350 per ton in the unit state so japan ha constantli been about 220 higher per ton becaus of such non price competit as deliveri and stabil and reliabl of qualiti which the blast furnac compani possess user have continu to us domest product up till now but it is to be expect that thi long term differ between foreign and domest price is have a strong impact on the cost competit of the final product in fact user who ar be forc to further reduc cost have begun to studi full scale us of low price import steel product alreadi mitsubishi heavi industri ltd japan s largest shipbuild ha decid that in fy94 it will doubl it previou rate of oversea procur of materi it is becom a situat where despit be under the condit of an iron chill no blast furnac compani will be abl to avoid price reduct to match oversea product in order to go on secur their market share the second point realiz of a gap between suppli and demand is not onli a problem of the blast furnac industri have a quantit excess suppli capac it is probabl also import that it is be forc to take anoth look at the strategi of improv the grade of steel product which everi compani ha pursu until now product of product with high ad valu particularli surfac treat steel plate which ar typic product type of major blast furnac compani ha continu to grow steadili sinc the oil shock at the rate of seven percent a year thi is becaus develop of the strategi to shift from pursu volum to enhanc qualiti which all blast furnac compani adopt when after 1975 nation crude steel product clearli level off suit the need of user with a greater inclin toward higher grade the compani all anticip a further expans of demand and advanc of the shift from product with low ad valu so thei have greatli increas and strengthen industri facil but now a movement ha appear in user and final consum to review a chang toward higher grade and higher qualiti that ha gone too far practic speak it is difficult to discov a need to equip passeng car which in japan ar us an averag of onli nine year with rustproof steel plate that can last as long as 30 year so it can probabl be said that the real situat is that compani ar becom orient toward rais the grade within a rang suit to need the result is that along with a declin in auto product demand for surfac treat steel plate ha declin by 13 percent from it peak on the other hand mani new facil have been complet so there ar indic that current averag oper capac ha fallen to about 60 percent thi mean that correct of earn power by enhanc qualiti which ha function effect in past recess ha run into a big barrier from both the user side and the supplier side attack electr furnac defend blast furnac the third item i point out the problem of the rise of electr furnac is to put it bluntli that tokyo steel mfg co ltd the largest electr furnac compani began to produc hot coil steel plate which wa the stronghold of blast furnac for the first time in japan begin in 1992 tokyo steel sold hot coil steel plate at about y45 000 more than y10 000 per ton below the exist market price and within about a year end up win approxim 30 percent of the 3 5 million ton import market which it had made it target as for qualiti at present there remain area where it is not up to that of blast furnac product but on ha to think that sooner or later blast furnac manufactur will feel the spread of it influenc even befor thi the proport of nation crude steel account for by electr steel wa on an upward trend but that wa done in steel bar and h beam which from the standpoint of blast furnac ar low valu ad construct materi for thin plate varieti a state of monopoli ha continu as a revenu sourc for blast furnac compani in other word becaus it enter a product where it is possibl to shake the foundat of blast furnac in the futur tokyo steel can becom an entiti which also threaten the lifelin of blast furnac here we can probabl see a design for attack electr furnac and defend blast furnac but as long as we look at the most recent situat the rollback by blast furnac is strike the situat is such that in product of h beam for the first half of fy93 the market share for blast furnac product rose for the first time in three year recov to 41 percent from 33 percent in fy87 furthermor move have been realiz to check the remark fast grow independ tokyo steel by attempt cooper and expans of busi content of compani which ar in their keiretsu for exampl topi industri which is affili with nippon steel corpor is consid new entranc into steel bar and kawasaki steel corpor ha decid to produc steel plate us electr steel manufactur by it keiretsu affili daiwa steel as a major trend there will probabl be no chang in the superior of the electr furnac which is gradual expand the type of product that it can produc and there is no doubt that in the futur the segreg of nich for product on the basi of blast furnac and electr furnac will becom more and more vagu it can be said that each blast furnac compani will have to chang from a strategi of put effort into high valu ad product to the direct of activ secur market share in all product even at the sacrific of immedi earn consequ it can probabl be said that it will be imposs in the futur for them to avoid a desper war of strength or war of attrit even as blast furnac compani the downfal of us blast furnac although there is a differ in degre in the follow point thi situat close resembl that of the us iron and steel industri in the first half of the 1980 s first besid domest demand for steel have declin becaus such manufactur industri as auto were lose competit as a result of a strong dollar and a chang in user tast there wa also an influx of rel inexpens import so a larg drop in price could not be avoid becaus of that in 1982 the amount of crude steel produc declin by 38 percent from the previou year retreat to the level of 36 year befor with the rate of oper fall to the 40 percent level and so on everi blast furnac compani end up have a big gap between suppli and demand and us electr furnac manufactur repres by nucor advanc rapidli with overwhelm cost competit as their weapon thei expand their share from 28 percent in 1981 to 40 percent in 1990 and so on the result wa that us blast furnac compani regist loss begin in 1982 and realli were unabl to restor profit until 1987 moreov even with that thei did not firmli establish a profit setup but were forc to record loss again accompani the fall in market condit after 1990 thi wa in spite of the fact that dure thi time thei strongli promot the restructur of busi by abandon product facil total more than 40 million ton for the industri and reduc employe by 250 000 about 64 percent but now against a background of enforc of antidump law and a steadi recoveri of their own countri s economi in addit to these effort at ration us steelmak ar steadili secur profit there is also a strong possibl that thei will overtak japan for the first time in 15 year in the volum of crude steel produc in 1994 it is probabl natur that there ar also area that differ between the unit state where a declin in intern competit in the area of qualiti and cost wa becom notic from the latter half of the 1970 s and that of present dai japan but it is probabl worth point out that even in the unit state which ha resolut carri out a bold restructur in thi wai recoveri realli requir 10 year the biggest caus for recoveri of the us steel industri be delai wa that it wa imposs to drastic increas intern competit by such thing as plant and equip invest at a time of success loss becaus of a declin in volum and in the market against the background of an influx of import the industri had to curtail invest in plant and equip moreov with plant and equip that ha becom obsolet on natur cannot attempt to enhanc qualiti or improv product effici and cost also becom rel higher the result wa that it had fallen into a viciou cycl of the market be conquer still further by import and busi result becom still more sluggish todai stagnat of busi result is becom long term thi wai even for japan s steel industri which ha the world s top level of qualiti and equip so if constrict of plant and equip invest continu it could veri well becom a situat similar to that of the us steel industri therefor the foundat of the structur reform which is be forc upon the blast furnac compani probabl come down to hasten reduct of cost by countermeasur which ar drastic and not shackl by preconceiv idea so as to restor price competit soon the stopgap of diversif and chang to high ad valu which have been carri out up to now and the strategi of each compani to keep abreast of the industri cannot be drastic measur the strategi that remain in that case where is the concret strategi that major blast furnac compani should choos in order to consid that i first analyz the cost structur of the major blast furnac compani and tri a comparison with south korea and taiwan i us south korea and taiwan in the comparison becaus whether view geograph qualit or from import busi result thei have begun to be the greatest competitor against japanes product pleas look at tabl 1 it is a breakdown of cost view by total cost without take into consider differ in product composit in the tabl with fy92 real result as the base for the sake of conveni i calcul 1 as 100 yen 750 won and nt 25 new taiwan dollar tabl 1 product cost in japan south korea and

compani nip pon steel corpor kawasaki steel corpor and sumitomo metal indu stri ltd whose nonferr metal depart ar of rel littl weight for south korea it wa pohang steel and for taiwan it wa china s teel the product cost per ton of steel materi in japan is 718 1 9 time as high as south korea s 388 and taiwan s 374 when we divid thi into fix cost and variabl cost the main variabl cost be the major raw materi of iron or and coke coal which ar procur on the intern market and the the basic unit us be about the same a larg differ ha not arisen among japan south korea and taiwan in contrast to thi in the fix cost per ton compar with south korea s 166 and taiwan s 150 japan is 435 so it work out to be a gap of from 2 6 to 2 9 time on can sai that the cost differenti among japan south korea and taiwan spring from fix cost personnel cost can probabl be list first as a reason why japan s fix cost ar high in comparison with south korea and taiwan in addit to south korea s annual unit cost for personnel be about 30 000 a level on third that of japan south korea is also superior in product judg by per capita product volum with 854 ton to japan s 730 ton therefor the personnel cost per ton is 35 for south korea and 133 for japan a multipl of 3 8 on the other hand in taiwan although per capita product is 633 ton below that of japan unit personnel cost is about 45 000 just half that of japan so personnel cost per ton come out to be less than japan after all in per ton cost of mainten and repair also it is estim that japan s burden about 90 is greater than south korea s 15 and taiwan s 1 thi is partli becaus the equip in the iron and steel mill that south korea and taiwan possess is newer so mainten and repair ar not too necessari but i think what is behind it is rather that when japan wa promot a chang to high valu ad product it thoroughli pursu greater effici in produc mani varieti in small volum to respond to custom need furthermor in the case of japan the burden of other fix cost product develop and improv cost which ar requir for provid high valu ad product is also heavi therefor in order to grasp intern competit in a more realist manner by take into consider differ in product composit we will make a comparison with hot coil plate as the benchmark the import thing for japanes steelmak is probabl whether or not the product cost for hot coil plate which hold the most central posit among steel product is low in comparison with the import price of product from south korea and taiwan if japanes product were to becom high in comparison the ration of produc everyth from pig iron to roll as an integr compani would end up be consider diminish the product cost for hot coil plate estim by the daiwa research institut take a typic japanes steel mill as the model wa a littl over 51 000 yen per ton in fy92 it break down to 39 600 yen for cost at the factori stage and 11 400 yen for headquart cost on the other hand the unit cost on a domest market base for import hot coil plate in the same period wa 55 500 yen for south korean product so at that stage the cost for japanes compani wa less than the market but the market ha now fallen to the level of 50 000 yen to 51 000 yen so if blast furnac compani product cost is also the same now i think their intern competit is alreadi in a fairli sever state therefor what is probabl demand first of all in order to recov competit is reduc the cost for hot coil plate howev in the next sever year of the employe who join the compani in great number dure the time of high growth a combin total for the five compani of over 10 000 will reach the mandatori retir ag becaus of that there is a view that the cost for major blast furnac compani will be reduc natur and even if loss were to also continu dure that time if thei cover it by realiz the latent profit from land and secur which is as much as 5 5 trillion yen for the five compani it would probabl also be possibl to again secur a certain amount of profit after that it is the view that there is no need to stir up feel of uneasi uselessli but thi doe not go beyond the realm of temporari improv of profit even if estim on the high side the cost reduct effect anticip from staff reduct would be about 3 000 yen per ton if the structur problem cite previous grow more seriou i think it will no longer be possibl to absorb them by that level of cost reduct white collar staff ar the target the first thing to be consid as an object for cut the cost of hot coil plate is probabl manag sector cost which grew conspicu after the strong yen recess it is estim that the cost per ton for the indirect manag sector which is made up of headquart cost and the portion of plant fix cost that correspond to manag process rose 7 900 yen from fy85 to fy92 becaus of that the benefit of cheap raw materi wa diminish greatli by the rise in the cost of the manag sector so total cost declin onli a mere 1 300 yen compar with the direct product sector where the effect of ration ha begun to appear indirect manag sector cost ar rise rapidli and ar thought to be a great weight on earn for cut cost in the indirect manag sector on can probabl cite rais the product of so call white collar staff all the blast furnac compani have alreadi made clear in medium rang plan that thei expect to reduc indirect sector personnel by 15 to 20 percent by transfer and the like but in a situat in which excess staff ha becom a problem for the entir industri it is difficult to imagin that mani compani will be abl to accept staff on temporari transfer furthermor even if all the place to receiv them were readi in order to preserv the salari level of the staff on transfer compani would have to carri the burden of pai the differ between the salari at the home compani and at the compani to which thei transfer so the realiti is that on cannot hope for the ration effect that would appear to exist on the face of thing herein li the problem with put staff reduct into effect through transfer accord to daiwa research institut estim with no increas in the salari base as a premis even by reduc indirect staff 20 percent through transfer it come out that on could expect a cost reduct effect of onli a littl under 500 yen per ton the effect of speed reduct of the cost of product develop and improv would be greater i think there is room for restudi whether excess enhanc of qualiti and pursuit of scrupul deliveri have not develop into excess qualiti and high cost it is probabl fulli possibl to reduc variou cost by reconsid proper qualiti and product process within limit not prejudici to user need in addit reduc cost by reform busi practic is also conceiv as a drastic plan for improv the commiss paid by blast furnac compani to trade compani for procur raw materi and sell their product is estim in the case of japan steel corpor for exampl to be at least 50 billion yen per year a littl over 2 000 yen per ton although difficult problem do exist becaus of histor circumst reduc cost by switch from thi system of commiss trade compani to on of manag thing in hous is probabl also worth studi there will also be industri reorgan but even if blast furnac compani recov price competit soon the environ will becom still harsher over the medium term the develop of nation product of crude steel ha move from a period of expans 1954 1970 which coincid with a period of high growth to a period of cycl 1971 to the present in which product vari upward and downward from a core of 103 104 million ton depend on the busi cycl in the futur the core level of the cycl is expect to drop to 90 95 million ton if the declin of domest demand becaus of deindustri and enhanc qualiti continu if in addit to domest demand for iron and steel decreas by 10 percent the ratio of import to appar demand were to becom 20 percent as in the unit state fy92 result were 8 percent and the ratio for electr steel were similarli to exce 40 percent fy92 result were 32 percent it would be a market reduct of a littl less than 23 million ton for blast furnac manufactur thi correspond approxim to the product scale of japan steel corpor the world s largest manufactur of iron and steel and mean that three of japan s typic larg scale iron and steel mill would becom surplu at thi point i will present as a new manag strategi a tent plan for industri reeingin the narrow of product type through prioriti invest at present blast furnac compani ar produc virtual everi varieti of steel product and the problem of the larg varieti of good produc is quit import as a factor in high cost the product lineup of everi compani close resembl that of the other so there ar also mani case in which it invit excess competit furthermor in portfolio manag in which profit product compens for unprofit sector on delai dispos of unprofit product as a result so it becom imposs to make us of asset effect big cost reduct will probabl be possibl if compani narrow the type of item thei produc and special in product at which thei ar stronger thi ration effect will be accompani by a reduct in the burden of plant and equip invest and simplif of the manag sector and also by effect asset util and an escap from excess competit so i think it will surpass a simpl increas in staff effici sumitomo metal industri plan for a buildup in seamless pipe which wa announc at the begin of 1993 will probabl be given great attent as pioneer in thi line at present becaus of such thing as the strong yen and a retreat in demand seamless pipe ha becom typic of unprofit product which ar record an estim yearli loss of 80 90 billion yen for the industri as a whole i think that thi kind of buildup plan in a situat in which earn ar sluggish is clearli a strategi to shake off pursuit by compet compani furthermor the appear of restructur that transcend the framework of individu compani is also conceiv to be precis by extend the narrow down of product type by each compani on can imagin such thing as swap of product type between compani a chang to joint ownership of equip and manag sector and dispos of surplu plant and equip which ar gener at that time and ultim merger particularli in regard to dispos of plant and equip there is a good possibl of earli realiz at present each compani s product setup is built on the assumpt that nation crude steel product estim at 104 106 million ton is the optimum rate of oper it is thought that thei will be review at a time when the product level is expect to declin over the medium term that will probabl also be similar for plant and equip for surfac treat on the other hand so far as can be consid at present there is littl likelihood of merger becom a realiti even if there were a merger ration of the indirect sector would requir consider time so it would probabl be difficult for the benefit to appear soon but there is a strong probabl of busi link be form becaus of plant site and product type it ha also been predict that the industri will be concentr into about three group in the futur in ani case we ar in a situat in which if the exchang level is not correct in the direct of a weaker yen no blast furnac compani will be abl to avoid a long term slump and a drop in competit unless there ar a rapid rise in product effici and a great reduct in manag cost it can probabl be said that japan s blast furnac industri ha an urgent need for the entir industri to adopt drastic measur which transcend preconceiv idea begin with major reduct in staff and curtail of the manag sector

steel from south korea where price ar more than 20 percent below domest price comment ar heard from sourc such as at nissan motor which sai a strong yen ha inspir a demand to lower materi cost which mean that it is onli logic to face up to demand for reduc the domest oversea price differenti on sheet metal price mai stabil but low price will persist for a long time the market price of h shape steel ha fallen significantli along with cut in manufactur price market price on angl steel and special shape steel will probabl drop further to level commensur with those establish as manufactur price howev sinc manufactur price have alreadi fallen below manufactur cost there is no room from a cost standpoint for addit manufactur price cut tokyo steel manufactur ha set the manufactur s price of 33 000 yen per ton for h shape steel as the final price from which further cut cannot be made and ha announc the cancel of the system of after the fact adjust to compens distributor for loss suffer becaus of sharp market price drop which in effect were cut in manufactur price even nippon steel ha analyz japan steel manufactur s market measur as be seriou and ha conclud that further price cut will not take place and ha also implement cancel in the after the fact adjust system thi mean that an armistic is in the process of be establish between tokyo steel manufactur and nippon steel on h shape steel where sharp price cut had taken place sinc distributor will move to rais resal price in respons to price measur taken by the maker the market for construct steel such as h shape steel should form a bottom howev the import privat sector demand for steel us in offic build will most like not recov for anoth two to three year a substanti rise in overal construct steel price will be difficult and the probabl scenario will reflect stabl low price price for sheet steel us on automobil and domest applianc will bounc off the bottom ow to the recoveri in consum purchas some steel maker like kawasaki steel sai that initi steel crude product plan of 22 4 million ton for the april june period have been revis upward by 1 6 million ton becaus of increas demand for sheet steel price will also stop drop howev fierc competit from import will preclud ani attempt at price hike and ani bottom of price will result in low price for the long term price war will heat up further and price drop will continu the steel maker engag in reckless expans dure the bubbl period capac for product of h shape steel ha grown to 7 million ton howev current demand is 3 5 million ton per annum mean that on half of the capac is excess as long as excess capac remain the steel maker mai speak of product cut but will not be abl to enforc major product cut even if h shape steel price stop fall temporarili there is the possibl that maker will look upon the situat as a good opportun to resum increas product creat product excess and caus price to drop again the armistic on the third h shape steel war mai just last until inventori adjust ar complet and later laps into anoth shoot war begin in april tokyo steel manufactur enter the steel sheet pile market which in the past wa monopol by the blast furnac oper manufactur price were set at about on half of those establish by blast furnac oper it wa as if it had challeng the blast furnac oper as a price destroy thi price war affect steel sheet pile and angl steel will not end until weak maker either withdraw from the market or fall by the waysid recoveri in economi will caus sharp turnaround steel demand for public work project will increas sharpli after summer privat sector demand for automobil and domest applianc should recov and progress smoothli and corpor capit invest should recov gradual inventori of h shape steel held by

and thi year if the mill continu at it current rate crawfordsvil will ship nearli 1m ton a princip reason is that the design assum that the entri nozzl which carri steel into the sm cast mould would
