conduct a studi on the effect of calcium estrogen and exercis on bone densiti and ar look for evid that osteoporosi can be prevent the studi is be conduct on women who had their final menstrual period more than three month earlier but less than five year ago we know that estrogen stop bone loss and we know that in certain popul exercis will help to a small extent said dalski who ha a doctor in exercis physiolog from brigham young univers in provo utah what hasn t been done especi in the earli post menopaus woman or in ani studi is to us both treatment while it is recommend that women get the recommend amount of calcium in their diet take calcium supplement alon will not prevent osteoporosi when calcium supplement ar combin with estrogen supplement thei seem to make the estrogen more

connecticut studi will be place in four group on group will receiv calcium onli anoth will receiv calcium and will exercis anoth will take estrogen and calcium and the fourth will get a combin of calcium estrogen and exercis dalski said the research hope to have 120 volunt we hope that by combin exercis with the estrogen a woman who is low in bone mass upon entri into the studi can maintain her bone mass and that with the combin of exercis and estrogen we can reduc her risk of fractur by make her bone stronger that s the goal dalski said the gradual loss of bone is painless until a fall

exercis for younger women will help keep bone strong but she stress that overdo it can have seriou ramif we ve all heard about women who exercis so strenuous that their menstrual period stop for some time and that s danger becaus thei lose the protect of estrogen and thei becom suscept to fractur much earlier in life she said the studi mai ultim show that women who us a moder exercis program up to
