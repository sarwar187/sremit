fail to take account of the highli select natur and the monopoli enjoi by mani if not all of those school which you cite as illustr the merit of singl sex school thi no doubt is true a corollari is that some school at least have gone co ed becaus of difficulti in recruit and or maintain standard while singl sex the survei offer strong prima faci evid for such a view howev it doe not affect our conclus that a disproportion share of the best school academ ar singl sex it doe not of cours follow that a system of singl sex educ is inher better the wide variat in fee and the weak of evid link

ratio is 9 3 1 select five with fee around pound 7 500 yield a ratio of onli 9 1 there is therefor no straightforward link between what you get and what you pai for neither in term of result nor of

dulwich colleg charterhous shrewsburi and haileyburi last year it gain more place at oxford and cambridg than ani other state school howev the town boast two other success grammar school and more remark sever secondari modern now call upper school with good examin result becaus our leagu tabl is base onli on a level it doe not show the upper school success but in gcse exam taken at 16 some of these school finish ahead of comprehens in neighbour milton keyn so the latest evid from the ft 1000 and the govern s exam statist suggest that the select educ system which britain ha been dismantl dure the last 25 year can be success for a wide rang of abil under certain condit the figur for buckinghamshir also illustr a more gener truth that where state school achiev good result the independ sector tend to be push into second place it might be object that high wycomb like some other place with good state school result is inhabit by the ambiti middl class whose children would do well in ani system our survei show for exampl that the best perform comprehens school ar those which serv area where affluent and educ peopl live such as north oxford or sunningdal in berkshir in

corner of berkshir and surrei weak competit from local independ school also help it seem that in thi area the dream of mani idealist of the 1950s and 1960s ha been fulfil thei hope then that strong middl class demand for improv state educ would make privat school unnecessari but the middl class alwai want the best for their children which in a select system mean grammar school good a level grade
