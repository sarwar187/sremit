return i think it is appropri on thi level to sai word indistinct i will sum thi up for you first the issu of our unfortun certif i think that the new element is that slovakia ha recent held talk with the european commun about eas the situat for the european commun in thi sphere thi mean that thei will not requir certain certif in fact it would be a measur discrimin against the czech side if irish portugues and danish export ar not oblig to acquir certif while czech export would be oblig to acquir them we receiv an assur an unequivoc assur from the slovak side an assur which i perceiv as a veri posit on that first noth ha been sign with the european commun onli talk have been held second the slovak side consid it self evid that if such an agreement with the european commun is conclud it is clear that it will be appli automat in the same wai for the czech republ therefor ani discrimin can be rule out i think that thi is the first import thing i would appreci if our mass media make thi clear becaus it is unfortun to quot each other untruthfulli i would be realli grate to you if you could commun thi clearli second we spoke about the so call old bloc all of us know what it mean both side have express interest in abolish thi old bloc in put it forward to the two parliament to approv thi thi mean that the slovak parliament ha to do so by august when it is to hold it last session befor the elect we would put thi forward to our parliament at it juli session becaus it doe not hold ani session in august ye there is an interest in abolish the old bloc in the wai which would make it imposs for ani oblig to emerg between the two state between the govern or between the govern and enterpris in the given countri thi mean tackl the issu of ani remain relat on the level of enterpris

the media we do not do thi and would much appreci the other side not engag in thi thi is in my view the fourth import conclus the fifth conclus is to take the border issu into the implement phase thi is an import issu there is an except to the disput area about which the slovak side ha clearli said that their side find it imposs to make concess the issu of the so call kasarna but otherwis it seem possibl to conclud all the other issu i think it is good to conclud these thing thi would mean do awai with yet anoth problem the slovak side sai that thei simpli do not perceiv the kasarna issu as on which might be solv by hand the territori over to the czech republ the onli option is to introduc specif condit in thi region open a special border and road introduc a special norm there which would
