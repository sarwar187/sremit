in quynh chau or the new rich second adolesc who curious try someth new by smoke just for fun and then get hook howev the third kind of addict is the most numer and pitiabl thei ar victim of poverti and backward addict happen to these peopl in two wai the first come from the belief that opium ha a tonic qualiti that give them strength to chop down tree and to clear bush to make terrac field is not an easi job and thi doe not count the distanc to be travel that requir climb hill and cross stream to compens for thi expend of energi an appropri intak of protein is need but these peopl usual do not have much to eat just a few bowl of rice even just a few piec of manioc or wild root then thei come to the opium smoke paraphernalia and as a magic wand a few puff banish the fatigu in their bodi thei do not know that the opium provid them with stimul that creat a fals strength a strength that sap their own bodi the second wai becaus of poverti and backward thei contract diseas thei do not get

realli had been work hard in thi total humanitarian task thei had to travel all the wai to hanoi to learn from other physician and to find medic the hanoi physician out of respect for their colleagu taught them the method of treatment and sold them 10 dose of medic at the total price of 3 million dong back at the center thei us three dose on three patient the first dai everyth wa fine the second

district cpv communist parti of vietnam committe secretari cao tien tan had a tradit prescript hand down from hi ancestor which he believ wa good but unfortun he wa in the posit of a district parti

to us the district parti secretari s prescript now call tk92 it wa tk92 that help to cure 113 of the 118 case with onli five patient becom addict again becaus of a recurr of their chronic diseas what did thei us to treat these diseas onc again opium and so thei becam addict onc more present patient in van chan district in yen bai provinc and in thai binh provinc have us tk92 with good result but tk92 us for addict in qui chau district ha not brought about ani good result probabl becaus of a failur to follow exactli the physician s prescrib instruct the method that quynh giang villag us to detoxifi addict wa total differ from that us by ky son whether becaus the 57 addict there had violat the honor of a local that had been given the nation public health lead banner or becaus of ani other reason that quynh giang adopt the dictatori measur to bear upon it addict we did not know prior to organ the detoxif program the villag had built four high wall it also put up a barb wire fenc in addit to the medic staff the villag cadr also station four public secur men there then order were issu for hold a meet then peopl were sent out to escort the addict in it wa as noisi as an oper launch to catch a bunch of bandit in the first phase there were 11 detoxif patient after two month a review found that five of them becam addict again in the second phase 12 patient were to receiv treatment but three of them escap becaus of excess fear the nine addict who were caught and taken to the center all went on medic hunger strike and promis that thei would quit the habit by themselv the result obtain in other center were no better than those in quynh giang que phong took in 22 addict for detoxif but four of them escap from the center leav 18 behind after two month a review found that 14 becam addict again in qui chau after two month 18 of 24 patient smoke again in tuong duong after two month 18 of 27 patient smoke again and so exclud the ky son detoxif center onli 24 case were treat sucessfulli in the other four center and yet in thi phase 1 the state had spent 170 million dong it wa becaus of the success and failur in phase 1 that the campaign leader have chang the wai to manag it sinc the middl of 1993 the nghe an public health servic ha been in charg of the detoxif program in the provinc perhap thi is the right approach medic speak drug addict is a diseas sinc it is a diseas treatment must come from physician question mark remain after more than a year of detoxif in nghe an we must reluctantli ask these question can nghe an save the more than 6 000 peopl the pitiabl and reproach peopl from the viciou cycl of addict when is thi mission of salvat over it is difficult for anybodi to offer an answer howev thi is not the onli pain we do not know whether some adolesc malaria patient and peopl afflict by stomach diseas stomach ach and so on ar get close to opium and befriend it at the same time when statistician ar ad and subtract figur or not we do
