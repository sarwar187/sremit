parti or polit persuas thei belong to i believ that the most import issu matter of deep concern there ar mani but the most import on compris the follow first of all the violenc i believ is uppermost in the mind of just about all our peopl secondli i believ the high crime rate becaus despit the multitud of death that have occur becaus of polit motiv i understand that 90 percent of the violenc is still attribut to crime coupl with that unemploy no job not suffici job for our peopl and then educ and train better educ better train to equip our peopl for the strenuou circumst that the new world order will requir of south african and then of cours hous proper hous the provis of hous as well as medic and health care now let me make it veri straight the on parti that is not involv in violenc is the nation parti the onli parti that ha been advoc that the leader should get togeth is the nation parti and the goldston commiss ha made a veri clear and categor find as to the main caus of the violenc it is the war between inkatha and the anc as far as crime is concern the anc would now like rapist to vote thei would like the gangster of cape town if caught and found guilti to vote venter thank you mr botha i m afraid gentlemen we ar go to have to be inflex with our time allot modis well the first opportun went to mr pik botha there the open statement thi time around will be made by the nation chairperson of the anc mr thabo mbeki mr mbeki mbeki well let me sai thi that our countri ha reach a decis point in it histori we ar veri close to the point where the polit order in thi countri should be chang and that s import thi is an object for which mani peopl have sacrif thousand of peopl have di thousand of peopl have been injur to produc a unit nonraci nonsexist democraci it s an import moment in our histori and we believ that such is it import that all south african need to be involv in bring about that kind of south africa now there ar mani challeng to that process some of some of which were demonstr todai there ar peopl who ar oppos to chang who don t want democraci who want a perpetu of apartheid a white minor rule we believ that all of us as south african ought to join hand to solv that problem not to sai thi on is to blame the other is to blame i m innoc but to sai as south african what do we do in order to ensur free and fair elect as south african what do we do to ensur peac that s import becaus apart from ensur free and fair elect part of what we ve got to do is to creat the circumst when it would be possibl for us to rebuild the economi of thi countri you can t rebuild it in condit of violenc and instabl and it doesn t help it doesn t help that anyon of us in respons posit blame the other what we should be do is to sai what should i do what should my parti do to contribut to thi climat of peac that s veri import it s go to be veri import that we have a program to creat an economi which provid job which provid hous which address these enorm imbal that exist in south african societi apartheid imbal whether thei ar racial or gender or region all of that ha to happen now i m sai that in the end here you have an african nation congress which for eight year plu ha fought for these idea we ar at the point where we ar sai that that victori for which so mani peopl have sacrif is about to be score and i do believ that a parti and organ such as the anc which for more than 80 year ha sacrif peopl in pursuit of these object thi is an organ that should be trust modis mr mbeki thank you veri much and now time for us crowd jeer time for us to take the first question mr freek robinson of agenda and the question to mr pik botha robinson mr pik botha i want to relat my question to the event of the dai and not about polici matter you have refer to violenc as a major problem in the countri todai mr thabo mbeki refer to the fact that we must have all the peopl of thi countri involv in the process and to ensur that there will be free and fair elect but i want to put it to you that peopl in the right wing and inkatha support sai that you ar in an unholi allianc with the anc and that you ar go to stick to an arbitrari elect date irrespect of the cost to live and that you ar do so for polit expedi to get a few more vote will you therefor in the climat that we have todai consid postpon the elect so that temperatur can come down and we can have the condit for free and fair elect with an inclus polit settlement botha the decis question is will it becom better will the circumst in thi countri be better if the elect is postpon that is a veri veri import question i doubt it with the cycl of violenc rise as it doe i have sever doubt that the climat will be better after 27 april so it would seem to me at thi moment of speak to you that the sooner we get the elect behind us the better becaus perhap a lot of the stress and strain and tension can be attribut to the fact that the countri ha not had an elect and then thi date wa not an arbitrari date thi date wa set long ago when all the parti of thi countri had the opportun to make a contribut and had an opportun to make suggest as to a proper date it is not our fault if parti did not make us of the opportun that were open and avail to them at the time and thi dai wa decid upon and the whole world is expect us to stick to it the whole world is expect south african now to come to peac with each other otherwis the world will turn it back against all of us and then it wouldn t matter who win the elect or it wouldn t matter what will happen next year we will be margin the world will lose interest in us the world will sai you ve had your chanc you have been negoti for three year you cannot make peac with yourself you ar like yugoslavia as a matter of fact you ar a doom countri applaus modis and thi opportun now goe to mr thabo mbeki of the anc mbeki let me sai thi also i agre with mr botha that elect crowd jeer i agre with mr botha the elect must go ahead as plan and as agre but in order to ensur that the elect go ahead as plan and as agre there ar certain respons that fall on all of us to creat the climat so that those elect ar free and fair now you cannot have you cannot have a situat where the anc book a stadium legal pai it deposit doe all of that and some peopl come and occupi that stadium with arm the previou dai the result is that the anc can t us the stadium mr botha s govern doe not sai to the secur forc of the countri you cannot allow that kind of thing to happen mr botha is correct the elect must go ahead but i am sai that the respons is on the part of govern to ensur that thi climat for free polit activ exist it ha to happen it s their respons the statement is correct but the action the action the action ar undermin the possibl the action of the south african govern ar undermin the possibl for free and fair elect that ha to be address modis thank you thank you mr mbeki and anoth respons from mr pik botha to what mr mbeki ha said botha the point is just that there is now a transit execut council tec applaus on which we have agre and there is a subcouncil on law and order and on on defens it is not the respons of the govern ani longer alon it never wa the govern s respons alon crowd jeer the unit nation and the whole world and the intern observ here will make it clear to you that thei expect all parti presid de klerk is thrown against hi head with a stone presid de klerk can t address a nation parti meet the nation parti can t open offic in transkei and what is happen about it noth there is uneven handed and the tec should attend to thi matter urgent and serious judg kriegler should not onli fly to kwazulu he should also fly to umtata he should also talk to the other leader there is now structur there is a structur in thi countri to take care of thi modis mr pik botha thank you veri much anoth minut crowd jeer mr mbeki mbeki the light here thei ar alreadi show red what i m sai is thi if somebodi come and occupi umlazi stadium illeg with gun the commission of polic should sai to the polic forc if necessari to the defens forc can you pleas go and remov those peopl so that the meet that wa permit can take place that s simpl straightforward the tec cannot instruct gen johan van der merw becaus you insist that when the tec wa set up it wa not replac the present govern govern must instruct johan van der merw to sai remov those peopl and that ha not happen and we have the crisi we have todai crowd jeer venter just befor we go to the next question which will be from lesli mashokw of

let s talk to them the afrikan volksfront nation front avf walk out of the negoti we said nevertheless let s sit with them and find a solut it is our genuin belief that let s find a peac negoti settlement the matter of the king the king of the zulu we have not met up to now the deleg of the king not becaus we didn t want to but that deleg hasn t come we ar readi to discuss each and everi singl question that is an obstacl to a peac resolut of their problem face the countri as a start point you can ask anyon of these peopl that i m talk about you can ask former bophuthatswana presid luca mangop what he want where he is now we sat with him in five meet to resolv whatev issu that he had now we want a peac resolut to these matter we want a peac resolut to the question that the ifp face what happen todai had noth to do with ani of that we would have thought given the fact that even todai there wa a tripartit meet the south african govern ifp and the king and ourselv as heard that it wa not necessari to march on anc offic in johannesburg anc headquart shell hous is at least eight block awai from the venu of the ralli venter interrupt mr mbeki thank you veri much mr botha a two minut respons crowd jeer botha job will onli be creat if thi countri attract suffici capit if new factori mine and job opportun ar creat the south african economi doe not have in itself healthi as it is at present and it ha recov remark as we ar now follow the condit of the intern monetari fund but it s as simpl as that to creat more job you re go to need increas train you ar not go to get monei unless paus oversea investor ar scare and frighten by the violenc and by statement made inter alia also by senior anc member not mr mbeki i agre but thi is what mr ben turok said a new south africa will need to defend it interest against the predat action of intern capit and it institut like the imf and world bank etc their intent to the third world ar clear enough to instal bourgeoi democraci and a new world order which recolon integr subordin the third world in a system of so call free market i sai thi with all respect to my anc friend stop talk like thi thi is marxist communist talk stop talk like thi crowd jeer thi is what is chase awai invest in addit to the violenc we must first overcom the violenc but then we must get in line with the imf becaus african countri who now subscrib to the condit of the imf have shown econom growth those who did not show econom declin applaus venter mr mbeki you have a on minut respons to that mbeki mr botha let s not move awai from the question that wa pose the question that wa pose wa event todai which might have an impact on job peac and stabil what i m sai is that what happen todai wa not necessari the reason it happen wa you have peopl who ar not interst in peac who ar not interest in the creation of the condit which make that invest possibl peopl were suppos to be demonstr halfwai across the town were never suppos to have been at the anc headquart thei came to caus troubl second the polic were warn on sundai to sai thi wa go to happen and no action wa taken to block these peopl to disarm them and you had the problem that you had we want peac we want job i wa sai thi we ve been bend over backward to find resolut venter thank you mr mbeki botha i spoke to venter interrupt sorri mr botha we have to move to

botha no mr mbeki is absolut right in sai what happen todai wa unnecessari but it s more complic it is almost imposs for the polic when in a march a group split up into other group you can t have polic on everi street corner what i want to sai emphat thi even and we have said it befor mass action in gener is not need if the anc feel that it ha such an overwhelm major then why should it resort to mass action if thei believ thei have such an overwhelm major help us to arrang the elect peacefulli and you can prove your overwhelm major where there s intimid there ar threat it is thi fight between inkatha and the anc that must stop the mass action by both parti must stop venter mr botha thank you modis thank to mr pik botha there now the opportun will go to ferial haffaje of the sabc radio new to pose a question to mr pik botha ferial haffaje mr botha just to move wai from the event of todai the homeland ar collaps like domino thei cost mani billion to creat do you agre that it wa a foreign polici failur and did ani good come from the homeland system botha no it not a foreign polici failur it s an intern polici failur the depart of foreign affair never creat the independ state laughter those which have collaps ye i believ todai that had thei follow differ polici thei would have been in a better posit becaus even if thei had never got independ then still you would have to administ the area thei still would have need hospit clinic a polic forc road build agricultur thei would have need to have dam built in those region i predict here todai that the cost of administr of the region would perhap exce the cost of administr of the independ state not that i prefer the independ state we have long ago decid that all of them should return to the jurisdict of south africa becaus of the econom integr and the realiti of our situat what happen in those two state is that the public servic turn against the govern of the dai and although a lot of instig and intimid might have taken place i think i must put the record straight and that is that also nation parti support in bophuthatswana were intimid by member of the mangop govern and in the case of ciskei i m surpris that it took so long befor we could make the chang laughter modis thank you right now the opportun goe to mr mbeki to respond mbeki what ha happen in thi particular area is an illustr of the wrong and the bankruptci of the system of apartheid the bantustan the homeland whatev name you want to give them ar veri typic apartheid and what we ve seen happen is a gener rebellion the minist is correct the civil servic and other peopl said we don t want thi thing in much the same wai as the overwhelm major of the popul doesn t want apartheid jeer and applaus no no it s true the minist and myself have spent a long time talk togeth he ha been administ these area laughter he ha been financ them but at least he ha the decenc to sai thi thing ha fail modis thank mr mbeki and we give anoth minut to mr pik botha botha ye the big danger face south africa is that south africa as a whole mai fail if the polici ar follow of the communist parti in thi countri and there ar element within the anc who would wish to do exactli like that write in the guardian yesterdai or the dai befor it wa state categor that what the communist parti want to do is to set up a complet central totalitarian regim that is the surest wai to get thi countri into a catastroph econom speak the countri ha done well econom over the past year despit it isol posit it ha the strongest economi south of the sahara there ar investor who ar interest but thei wil onli modis mr pik botha thank you veri much and anoth minut jeer a final comment on thi issu from mr mbeki mbeki minist the communist parti did not creat the bantustan laughter the nation parti creat the bantustan that s a matter of fact you don t have to disput that what the peopl of thi countri ar sai is that thei re against apartheid it s not south africa that will collaps it s apartheid that must collaps and our common responsibl is to creat a nonraci democraci modis thank you mr mbeki venter our next question is from anna mari mischk of rapport mischk mr mbeki dure the past decad or even a bit longer the anc and befor it the mass democrat movement have abundantli and veri often veri effect us mass action as an instrument to get what it want we have seen exampl of thi dure the past week onc more in the toppl of some of the homeland govern but after 27 april we re go to have presum a democrat elect govern most probabl with the anc as a major parti in that govern jeer applaus if thi cultur of mass action and what we more and more see polit intoler is go to prevail after the elect what is the anc attitud go to be to mass action not onli from your own peopl but from other parti who obvious ar follow the exampl mbeki anna mari it s veri import to protect in ani polit settlement the right of the peopl to take peac action the anc will sai and insist on thi that even when it is govern all condit must be creat such that the peopl can take such mass action as thei wish if thei ar oppos to what an anc govern is do thei must take that action so it is a fundament democrat right it s a right of the peopl to go out into the street and sai we protest we demand the follow jeer no no no no you sai ak 47 let me tell you what happen in durban a huge demonstr over the weekend and what happen the polic put barb wire and anc peopl walk up and down veri peacefulli noth happen jeer and you had a demonstr in johannesburg todai when the govern and the polic were warn that it wa go to be violent and peopl came into the center of johannesburg as demonstr with gun anc peopl didn t come with gun in durban jeer anna mari what i m sai is that we shall defend the right of everybodi to engag in mass action against an anc govern it s a fundament democrat right jeer venter thank you veri much mai i remind the audienc of their oblig to the candid mr botha you have two minut botha i do not doubt the good intent of mr mbeki what i sai is that those intent ar not translat into realiti in practis the fact of the matter is that we have warn time and again both inkatha and the anc that in a tens atmospher you should not organ mass action becaus crimin element ar join thi mass action innoc peopl ar be attack car ar be burn human be ar be burn and then it s too late to come and sai later that thi wa intend to be a peac march but let us look at the oversea comment i invit the sabc to make a summari of report in all the influenti newspap all over the world of the past two to three week then you will get the answer and that answer is simpli thi on that the anc and inkatha ar to blame for the violenc ye you have a right to protest but ordinari citizen also have a right to be protect you cannot march and then burn down peopl s car you cannot march and then break into shop and steal good from shop owner and as i said befor if the anc is so sure of victori and someon i think you impli that most probabl thei weren t we have not yet had the elect let us first have the elect the nation parti ha everi intent to come out as the strongest parti and the wai the anc now conduct itself we will come out as the strongest parti jeer venter thank you veri much mr botha thank you veri much we appreci a live audienc i remind you that a courtesi would be to give the candid the time that s still allot to them mr mbeki you have 1 minut left mbeki mr botha we need to understand the np need to wage a campaign to win elect i understand that but let s look at the actual you know the actual of thi countri is like what for instanc the goldston commiss said you know there ar veri seriou charg that have been made about who is behind thi violenc jeer no realli serious who is behind thi the goldston commiss doe not make those charg lightli i think we need to address those question serious i conced the object you have of battl to win elect that s fine but we must not in the process of that turn our back on the truth venter your final minut mr botha botha there is all over the world in all respons circl todai it s accept that apartheid is gone that is why the nobel peac prize wa award also to presid de klerk that is why the unesco peac prize wa award also to presid de klerk that is why the philadelphia peac medal and liberti medal wa also alloc or award to presid de klerk in other word it is onli the anc i think thei feel extrem sorri that apartheid wa abandon becaus thei ve lost their platform certainli the communist parti feel that apartheid should have continu a littl longer i have now reach the stage where we must realli object analyz our situat unless we fall in line with the modern and success industri economi of the world it wil not be a pleaseant thing to govern thi countri and the anc have not yet taken that step venter thank you mr botha modis again the opportun to ask the next question is still with anna mari mischk of rapport newspap and thi time the question goe to mr pik botha mischk mr botha four year ago when the anc and the sacp were unban on of the reason that were given by your govern wa that the communist threat had disappear or diminish to such an extent that you felt free to unban them becaus of what happen in eastern europ now veri soon member of your parti will probabl be in the same cabinet as some communist but suddenli a campaign against the communist parti and against communist ha becom a veri definit featur of your elect campaign what i d like to know now ha the nation parti had second thought about the communist laughter or is it just veri us to take the old bogeymen of the total onslaught year back from under the bed where you have alwai had the red what is the situat around the communist in the nation parti botha no we have never had second thought about the south african communist parti sacp but the moment you decid to legal an organ then you need not chang your view you need not start like them you then put your hope in the peopl of the countri to reject it that is the democrat wai and that wa the basi of our decis our concern now is that we were challeng by the sacp here i must sai not the anc but the sacp to prove that more than 16 of the candid on the anc nation list ar communist and we did so 25 of them ar and thi is of major concern not suddenli to the south african govern professor johnson an oxford academ wrote three dai ago in the london time that the sacp had too strong an influenc on the anc and that is pose a danger for south africa s econom growth thi is come from a well known and reput expert on southern africa but what is more imf economist share the same view so thi is not just someth that the np suddenli have drawn into the debat thi is there all the time and our concern is that not even the anc will be abl to resist thi firm grip which the sacp now ha on the anc jeer and that will preclud invest there s not a singl countri in the world todai where a communist parti is particip in an elect thi is the point i want to start make the anc ha the wrong alli we shed apartheid we got rid of that burden we admit the mistak that it wa i m wait for my anc friend to take the same bold step modis mr botha thank you veri much we give a two minut opportun to mr thabo mbeki mbeki the problem can i appeal modis interrupt let me appeal to the member of the variou organ pleas give the repres of your organ the opportun to state their case pleas thank you mbeki can i appeal to the np can you listen to what i m go to sai if you disagre with it when i ve said it pleas object but pleas listen you see the problem about thi issu is that the np ha gone back to old wai it s gone back to old wai the np doe not sai thi is what we find to be wrong and communist in the program of the anc which would be legitim to sai we believ that what you sai about thi or that or the other is communist and therefor bad for the countri the np doe not sai that which you can then debat the np sai you ve got secret file which show the follow about peopl i m sai it goe back to what it ha alwai done and what it s try to do the np is i think veri unfortun it s try to demon the anc to sai to the peopl out there it constitu that thi is a demon which must be destroi that is precis what produc the killer that we have on our street jeer brian mitchel who wa respons for trustfe said we did what we had to do becaus we were told that it wa an anti christ and we had to destroi it the np without a shred of evid in term of polici is sai that the countri is go to disast becaus modis interrupt mr mbeki thank you veri much and now the next minut s opportun is for mr pik botha botha i would like to repeat mr mbeki s appeal also give us a chanc to put our viewpoint and then disagre or agre i do not need to reli mere on np point of view on commun it s a fail system the world over it creat miseri in poland hungari czechoslovakia in bulgaria in albania in the 15 republ of the former soviet union it is a fail system it ha brought miseri to million of peopl econom miseri and social miseri and miseri in everi sphere of life so i need not defend the np polici in thi respect we sai it is inher a bad polici just as apartheid wa on and we ar strong enough and bold enough to sai apartheid wa wrong we shed it we re thrown it off and now we sai to south african pleas let us move forward modis mr pik botha thank you veri much your minut is up jeer cheer last opportun thi minut to mr mbeki mbeki minist you have absolut everi right to talk about poland and bulgaria and thi and that and the other what i m sai is i haven t heard on singl thing said by the np to sai in term of the anc polici as we understand it thi element is communist that element is communist the other is communist noth all that is happen is that the np is go back to it old wai the new np is go back to it old wai demon invok fear in peopl without a singl shred of evid to sai thi is the communist polici that the anc is go to implement becaus it s not there that is not true venter our next question from ferial haffaje of sabc radio haffaje on to monei matter mr mbeki thi countri s debt burden is well over 114 billion rand we pai 1 billion rand a month in interest alon how ar we go to pai our debt and creat job and build school and improv health care mbeki you ar quit correct there ar enorm challeng that face us as a countri becaus we inherit an economi that ha been in declin for a long time it is an economi that made million of peopl unemploi an economi that s made million of peopl homeless an economi that make children die of hunger now central and critic to what ha to happen to thi economi is we ve got to ensur that new invest consider invest take place part of what you ve got to do with regard to that issu is you ve got to creat the polit circumst the peac and the stabil that s import you ve got to creat the econom polici which sai to the investor thi is a safe place to invest you ve got to bear in mind that south africa is in competit with the rest of the world in term of foreign invest or invest gener includ domest invest that s a matter on which we ve got to focu to creat the polit and econom climat for that invest to take place that s the first thing and that is what we re battl now you ve got to creat the polici and that s the polici that the anc is put forward in term of an econom polici framework which make that invest possibl and then you ve got to address thi issu of the million of the peopl who ar depriv so that thei feel comfort with thi chang it s bring them someth i m sai it s possibl to do it venter the time ha caught you mr mbeki i m sorri mr botha ha a two minut respons botha the fact of the matter is that south africa thi bad place thi bad place is produc 40 percent of the gdp of sub saharan africa consist of 42 countri with a total popul of 500 million the fact of the matter is that the economi of thi countri is the envi of the whole of africa the fact of the matter is that when gener obasanjo a nigerian leader who land here for the first time and he flew the helicopt over pretoria witwatersrand area when i greet him he said to me i am suffer from shock i am suffer from shock i didn t know such a wonder industri area exist south of the sahara the fact of the matter is that anc member who go to other part of africa can confirm thi thei can confirm that thi countri is the hope of africa africa want us to succe africa said we have achiev so much and the fact of the matter is the remov of apartheid alon will not bring stabil and econom growth onli sound polici and be in line with the industri economi of the world todai and thi the nation parti can do and onli the nation parti can do thi that is why govern deleg on after the other sai to me unless the nation parti continu to have a decis role and a strong posit after the elect south africa will not attract ani invest that is a simpl fact applaus venter allow mr mbeki a minut s comment pleas mbeki the fact of the matter is that we have in thi countri a higher infant mortal rate than botswana ha it is a fact of the matter the fact of the matter is that zimbabw ha got more black engin than we have here that is a fact of the matter the fact of the matter is that thi economi with all the potenti that it ha ha produc i wa sai at least 5 million unemploi peopl laughter i wouldn t consid that a success i think it is failur it ha got potenti despit what the nation parti ha done despit what the nation parti ha done it ha the thing that the minist sai it doe becaus in realiti thi economi is much larger than ani of these other economi venter thank you mr mbeki mr botha could you wrap that up botha i would just like to give the fact as thei exist adult literaci rate for sub saharan africa 45 percent south africa 76 percent life expect at birth sub saharan african 52 year south africa 63 year infant mortal rate sub saharan africa 107 south africa 56 the fact is that we have not made 5 million unemploi across the world you have world tide of recess etc the fact of the matter is we have 2 million

stadia in order to block meet from take place the govern doe not sai pleas go and remov those peopl so that we can have a climat of free polit activ it doesn t happen ye inde ye inde we ar quit certain veri mani polic peopl men and women veri mani member of the south african defens forc ar veri consciou of their duti and veri commit to ensur that thi chang take place but what happen dai in

afraid i total disagre thi is again typic of the anc blame everybodi els the common denomin in all violent activ in thi countri is the anc it is the anc and apla azanian peopl s liber armi it is the anc and dp it is the anc and inkatha alwai the common denomin is the anc the fact of the matter is thei have a respons and i think thi even the minist declar 10 district in johannesburg to be under unrest area the moment he want to do that the anc is against it the polic doe need certain power but we must act in term now of the tec legisl everi time the polic need addit power it is deni them why ar these power deni it is becaus the anc see some sinist motiv in some of these addit power and you mai well reach the stage where we mai have to give far more power to the polic but then it must be done in term of the tec venter mr botha thank you veri much your minut is up and thi time an opportun to mr mbeki mbeki part of the problem with thi discuss is the minist is avoid the specif what i am sai have discuss thi matter yesterdai with the govern about what wa like to happen in johannesburg todai and have agre that roadblock would be put and peopl search so that thei could come and demonstr without weapon why wa it not done have discuss all matter of thing for govern to sai there must be free polit activ peopl must not occupi stadia with gun thei must be stop why is it not done i am sai that ani number of specif instanc where there ha been failur of govern as a result of which peopl have di and that is realiti venter thank you mr mbeki well a final question then from freek robinson of agenda to mr mbeki robinson mr mbeki my first question i have tri to come down to the underli reason for the violenc and it is clear to all of us basic that thi polit framework in which we oper includ the basi for the elect and the basi of the govern in the next two year after the elect it is someth that is contest by other peopl there ar mani fear among the smaller parti in particular about the constitut and what might happen after the elect the fear is that you might win the elect convincingli even with a two third major and that you might scrap the interim constitut complet can you give me a clear indic tonight what exactli is it that you would like to chang in that constitut delet or add to it mbeki the first thing that i need to sai freek is that the anc with regard to these constitut matter that you rais the anc is bound by two document which were agre in the multiparti negoti on of them is the declar of intent that wa agre right at the begin of thi multiparti process we ar bound by that document secondli there ar constitut principl which ar contain in the interim constitut the anc is bound by those principl what do thei do that first document and the second on thei spell out a unit democrat nonraci nonfascist south africa entrench human right for everybodi regular elect a multiparti polit system an independ judiciari all of these question that is what thei spell out all of these provis that is what the anc bound to now the interim constitut that we have is a product of the process of negoti it doe not reflect necessarili anc view but i am sai that the anc would be bound to those basic principl it would also be bound to the notion that we need to take the countri not just anc support and anc member that is to draft a constitut it must be base on accept by the major of the peopl in the countri so that even if the anc got a two third major it would want to proce in a manner that take nation consensu clearli there ar mani thing in the constitut that need to be look at there have been mani debat about mani issu there is an outstand debat venter interrupt thank mr mbeki i am sorri mr botha now ha a two minut repli to it botha i am awar of the fear the concern particularli the smaller parti and of certain commun and not necessarili white commun also black commun of thi countri thei sai to us openli at time we were anc we know them but fact of the matter is we believ it is a good constitut and all constitut the world over it is not the end of constitut develop as far as i am concern it is begin of the new era that is what 27 april mean and i have the firm belief that the intern commun thi new world order with it new condit will simpli not allow the futur south african govern and we ar go to be part of that govern not becaus of favorit but that is the agreement between us and the laughter no but it s a fact we ar go to be part of it and a strong part of it becaus a vast number of black peopl ar of the convict ye thei would like to vote for the anc i sai thi openli but thei also sai but then the nation parti must be part an overwhelm major of black south african want a govern of nation uniti in thi countri and thi is import but the constitut basic is a good constitut it is a reason constitut it doe recogn a feder system and it doe make it possibl for all the provinc to retain a larg measur of autonomi and to be feder state and to preclud the interfer of the central govern in those matter which have been alloc to the provinc thi is how we must start there is no other wai we must now go into the elect test our rel support and start the new south africa so that we can get invest on condit that the nation parti is still part of the govern venter sorri to cut you off mr botha mr mbeki you have a on minut repli mbeki as far as the small parti ar concern we have throughout thi process made sure that thei were parti to these decis the whole multiparti process ha involv them if you look at for instanc what is now call the anc elect list you ll see mani small parti there and part of the reason thei ar there is so that we can ensur that thei ar repres in parliament if thei stood on their own thei would not win but precis to make sure that their voic is heard we put them on our own list so i am sai the anc mr pik botha is correct the nation parti will be a minor parti laughter but we ar sai that never mind that it is a minor parti it ought to be part of thi new govern becaus it is import that thei make a contribut on the construct of thi new south africa venter thank you mr mbeki mr botha you have on minut to close the issu botha i sincer believ that the best thing that can happen to south africa is that there should be no major parti after the elect that all of us must not onli be if i mai put it thi wai be forc by the constitut to form a govern of nation uniti but it must alwai be the choic of the major of south african that there should not be on strong domin polit parti and that is why i sai again there is onli on wai to achiev that in the elect and that is to vote for the nation parti and to ensur that thi countri will not be domin but i do not share those fear as i said befor the new world order will not allow the futur south african govern in my opinion to do as it like what is the danger is that irrespons element within the anc might exercis too strong an influenc in the anc venter mr botha thank you veri much that close off the question section of thi debat thank you applaus modis well obvious veri enthusiast member of the polit parti who ar here tonight right now we ar come to the end of the program we ar give the opportun a three minut opportun to mr thabo mbeki to make a statement on variou issu that he feel need to be known mbeki well i realli need to sai thi that as i wa sai at the begin the countri is face with a great opportun and a great challeng we understand the heat that get develop around elect campaign but we believ that it is the common respons of everybodi who in the countri consid themselv a leader of ani signific section of the popul of our countri to approach these matter in a respons manner we do inde believ that we need to develop a nation consensu around a number of basic issu on of those issu ha to be that it is a right of everi south african to vote to elect a govern of their choic therefor it cannot be permit that there is somebodi out there who consid themselv part of a leader of some peopl who want to block that process i think the countri need to unit to sai nobodi should be block from exercis that democrat right to decid what govern thei want that is an import thing the question of violenc the question of violenc is import we need all of us i am sai again to act togeth to resolv thi matter so that the anc ha the respons to sai to it own member thi is not allow ani other parti that is involv need to do the same thing but also the govern the govern need to approach thi matter to resolv the issu and not tie it to parti polit advantag to sai it is alwai the anc and the ifp that ar fight if thei meet and so on why ar the polic allow to watch as peopl ar kill themselv simpli becaus thi matter is defin as parti polit there is an intervent by govern that ha to be made i am sai that is a common nation respons wherev the violenc come from whether from the anc peopl or whoever that we must all of us act veri firmli and decis to address thi issu i think final i do not know what my time is like i think it is fundament wrong fundament wrong to sai of an organ like the anc that it s a demon it is the same anc that ha stood for nonraci for democraci and all of these thing which must bring the major of the peopl of thi countri into the settlement to turn round and sai thei ar a demon becaus what you ar do you ar creat a situat where we will not be abl to resolv the problem of thi countri if you take that attitud toward the anc you will then get that demon i think it is irrespons venter interrupt mr mbeki thank you veri much mr botha a similar three minut thank you botha it is quit clear to me that south african have a stark choic to make on 27 april a stark choic between those parti and particularli the anc that find itself in allianc with the wrong parti an anc that cannot disciplin it own follow cannot control them dure mass action an anc who allow individu to attack the industri nation of the world to attack the industri economi of the world and to sai derogatori thing about the imf and the world bank becaus in the new world order that is come the anc would have no choic and mr mbeki quit rightli earlier on about specif the whole issu of the miner right that must be restor to the state of the peopl i wonder whether the anc realiz what that ha done to the economi of thi countri and to invest of thi countri i want to warn the anc a govern cannot run a mine stai out of it but in the end i am encourag by the new that there might soon be a meet between presid de klerk mr mandela the king of the zulu and dr buthelezi and that i see that in the spirit in which mr mbeki offer with that i agre we ar all south african we onli have on south africa let us come to peac with ourselv and let us prai that these four leader will find a wai to reduc the tension that ha been creat in thi countri and let us prai for that and hope and hold thumb that that meet will be success we all need it we have onli on countri and we ar go to share it and histori will condemn all of us if we do not share thi respons there i agre with my friend and colleagu mr mbeki venter thank to mr pik botha there befor we leav the debat we ar go to ask each of the candid for a quick impress of the discuss we have just had start with mr mbeki mbeki well lester i think we should sai congratul to the sabc for afford thi kind of opportun i don t think there is suffici time given for real debat i hope that it would be possibl to organ so that we do inde have real debat so that i talk to my friend pik botha there so instead of promot the nation parti actual debat issu venter thank you veri much mr mbeki can we come back to mr botha pleas botha i am glad thi could take place in that we could openli canvass our view but perhap i don t know perhap we should do it in a more relax atmospher i do not want to reduc the enthusiasm of the audienc but i think we tend to lose some of the valu of argument on both side if the two speaker cannot realli be heard it is not a complaint and then lastli those who ar support of the nation parti pleas drive carefulli home those who ar not who am i to tell you how to drive venter thank you veri much for particip mr mbeki and mr botha modis and befor we sai good night the leader of the two parti the nation parti and the african nation congress mr fw de klerk and mr nelson mandela will meet in a debat similar to thi on on 14 april venter don t miss that good night
