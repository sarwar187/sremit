parti or polit persuas thei belong to i believ that the most import issu matter of deep concern there ar mani but the most import on compris the follow first of all the violenc i believ is uppermost in the mind of just about all our peopl secondli i believ the high crime rate becaus despit the multitud of death that have occur becaus of polit motiv i understand that 90 percent of the violenc is still attribut to crime coupl with that unemploy no job not suffici job for our peopl and then educ and train better educ better train to equip our peopl for the strenuou circumst that the new world order will requir of south african and then of cours hous proper hous the provis of hous as well as medic and health care now let me make it veri straight the on parti that is not involv in violenc is the nation parti the onli parti that ha been advoc that the leader should get togeth is the nation parti and the goldston commiss ha made a veri clear and categor find as to the main caus of the violenc it is the war between inkatha and the anc as far as crime is concern the anc would now like rapist to vote thei would like the gangster of cape town if caught and found guilti to vote venter thank you mr botha i m afraid gentlemen we ar go to have to be inflex with our time allot modis well the first opportun went to mr pik botha there the open statement thi time around will be made by the nation chairperson of the anc mr thabo mbeki mr mbeki mbeki well let me sai thi that our countri ha reach a decis point in it histori we ar veri close to the point where the polit order in thi countri should be chang and that s import thi is an object for which mani peopl have sacrif thousand of peopl have di thousand of peopl have been injur to produc a unit nonraci nonsexist democraci it s an import moment in our histori and we believ that such is it import that all south african need to be involv in bring about that kind of south africa now there ar mani challeng to that process some of some of which were demonstr todai there ar peopl who ar oppos to chang who don t want democraci who want a perpetu of apartheid a white minor rule we believ that all of us as south african ought to join hand to solv that problem not to sai thi on is to blame the other is to blame i m innoc but to sai as south african what do we do in order to ensur free and fair elect as south african what do we do to ensur peac that s import becaus apart from ensur free and fair elect part of what we ve got to do is to creat the circumst when it would be possibl for us to rebuild the economi of thi countri you can t rebuild it in condit of violenc and instabl and it doesn t help it doesn t help that anyon of us in respons posit blame the other what we should be do is to sai what should i do what should my parti do to contribut to thi climat of peac that s veri import it s go to be veri import that we have a program to creat an economi which provid job which provid hous which address these enorm imbal that exist in south african societi apartheid imbal whether thei ar racial or gender or region all of that ha to happen now i m sai that in the end here you have an african nation congress which for eight year plu ha fought for these idea we ar at the point where we ar sai that that victori for which so mani peopl have sacrif is about to be score and i do believ that a parti and organ such as the anc which for more than 80 year ha sacrif peopl in pursuit of these object thi is an organ that should be trust modis mr mbeki thank you veri much and now time for us crowd jeer time for us to take the first question mr freek robinson of agenda and the question to mr pik botha robinson mr pik botha i want to relat my question to the event of the dai and not about polici matter you have refer to violenc as a major problem in the countri todai mr thabo mbeki refer to the fact that we must have all the peopl of thi countri involv in the process and to ensur that there will be free and fair elect but i want to put it to you that peopl in the right wing and inkatha support sai that you ar in an unholi allianc with the anc and that you ar go to stick to an arbitrari elect date irrespect of the cost to live and that you ar do so for polit expedi to get a few more vote will you therefor in the climat that we have todai consid postpon the elect so that temperatur can come down and we can have the condit for free and fair elect with an inclus polit settlement botha the decis question is will it becom better will the circumst in thi countri be better if the elect is postpon that is a veri veri import question i doubt it with the cycl of violenc rise as it doe i have sever doubt that the climat will be better after 27 april so it would seem to me at thi moment of speak to you that the sooner we get the elect behind us the better becaus perhap a lot of the stress and strain and tension can be attribut to the fact that the countri ha not had an elect and then thi date wa not an arbitrari date thi date wa set long ago when all the parti of thi countri had the opportun to make a contribut and had an opportun to make suggest as to a proper date it is not our fault if parti did not make us of the opportun that were open and avail to them at the time and thi dai wa decid upon and the whole world is expect us to stick to it the whole world is expect south african now to come to peac with each other otherwis the world will turn it back against all of us and then it wouldn t matter who win the elect or it wouldn t matter what will happen next year we will be margin

monei unless paus oversea investor ar scare and frighten by the violenc and by statement made inter alia also by senior anc member not mr mbeki i agre but thi is what mr ben turok said a new south africa will need to defend it interest against the predat action of intern capit and it institut like the imf and world bank etc their intent to the third world ar clear enough to instal bourgeoi

botha no mr mbeki is absolut right in sai what happen todai wa unnecessari but it s more complic it is almost imposs for the polic when in a march a group split up into other group you can t have polic on everi street corner what i want to sai emphat thi even and we have said it befor mass action in gener is not need if the anc feel that it ha such an overwhelm major then why should it resort to mass action if thei believ thei have such an overwhelm major help us to arrang the elect peacefulli and you can prove your overwhelm major where there s intimid there ar threat it is thi fight between inkatha and the anc that must stop the mass action by both parti must stop venter mr botha thank you modis thank to mr pik botha there now the opportun will go to ferial haffaje of the sabc radio new to pose a question to mr pik botha ferial haffaje mr botha just to move wai from the event of todai the homeland ar collaps like domino thei cost mani billion to creat do you agre that it wa a foreign polici failur and did ani good come from the homeland system botha no it not a foreign polici failur it s an intern polici failur the depart of foreign affair never creat the independ state laughter those which have collaps ye i believ todai that had thei follow differ polici thei would have been in a better posit becaus even if thei had never got independ then still you would have to administ the area thei still would have need hospit clinic a polic forc road build agricultur thei would have need to have dam built in those region i predict here todai that the cost of administr of the region would perhap exce the cost of administr of the independ state not that i prefer the independ state we have long ago decid that all of them should return to the jurisdict of south africa becaus of the econom integr and the realiti of our situat what happen in those two state is that the public servic turn against the govern of the dai and although a lot of instig and intimid might have taken place i think i must put the record straight and that is that also nation parti support in bophuthatswana were intimid by member of the mangop govern and in the case of ciskei i m surpris that it took so long befor we could make the chang laughter modis thank you right now the opportun goe to mr mbeki to respond mbeki what ha happen in thi particular area is an illustr of the wrong and the bankruptci of the system of apartheid the bantustan the homeland whatev name you want to give them ar veri typic apartheid and what we ve seen happen is a gener rebellion the minist is correct the civil servic and other peopl said we don t want thi thing in much the same wai as the overwhelm major of the popul doesn t want apartheid jeer and applaus no no it s true the minist and myself have spent a long time talk togeth he ha been administ these area laughter he ha been financ them but at least he ha the decenc to sai thi thing ha fail modis thank mr mbeki and we give anoth minut to mr pik botha botha ye the big danger face south africa is that south africa as a whole mai fail if the polici ar follow of the communist parti in thi countri and there ar element within the anc who would wish to do exactli like that write in the guardian yesterdai or the dai befor it wa state categor that what the communist parti want to do is to set up a complet central totalitarian regim that is the surest wai to get thi countri into a catastroph econom speak the countri ha done well econom over the past year despit it isol posit it ha the strongest economi south of the sahara there ar investor who ar interest but thei wil onli modis mr pik botha thank you veri much and anoth minut jeer a final comment on thi issu from mr mbeki mbeki minist the communist parti did not creat the bantustan laughter the nation parti creat the bantustan that s a matter of fact you don t have to disput that what the peopl of thi countri ar sai is that thei re against apartheid it s not south africa that will collaps it s apartheid that must collaps and our common responsibl is to creat a nonraci democraci modis thank you mr mbeki venter our next question is from anna mari mischk of rapport mischk mr mbeki dure the past decad or even a bit longer the anc and befor it the mass democrat movement have abundantli and veri often veri effect us mass action as an instrument to get what it want we have seen exampl of thi dure the past week onc more in the toppl of some of the homeland govern but after 27 april we re go to have presum a democrat elect govern most probabl with the anc as a major parti in that govern jeer applaus if thi cultur of mass action and what we more and more see polit intoler is go to prevail after the elect what is the anc attitud go to be to mass action not onli from your own peopl but from other parti who obvious ar follow the exampl mbeki anna mari it s veri import to protect in ani polit settlement the right of the peopl to take peac action the anc will sai and insist on thi that even when it is govern all condit must be creat such that the peopl can take such mass action as thei wish if thei ar oppos to what an anc govern is do thei must take that action so it is a fundament democrat right it s a right of the peopl to go out into the street and sai we protest we demand the follow jeer no no no no you sai ak 47 let me tell you what happen in durban a huge demonstr over the weekend and what happen the polic put barb wire and anc peopl walk up and down veri peacefulli noth happen jeer and you had a demonstr in johannesburg todai when the govern and the polic were warn that it wa go to be violent and peopl came into the center of johannesburg as demonstr with gun anc peopl didn t come with gun in durban jeer anna mari what i m sai is that we shall defend the right of everybodi to engag in mass action against an anc govern it s a fundament democrat right jeer venter thank you veri much mai i remind the audienc of their oblig to the candid mr botha you have two minut botha i do not doubt the good intent of mr mbeki what i sai is that those intent ar not translat into realiti in practis the fact of the matter is that we have warn time and again both inkatha and the anc that in a tens atmospher you should not organ mass action becaus crimin element ar join thi mass action innoc peopl ar be attack car ar be burn human be ar be burn and then it s too late to come and sai later that thi wa intend to be a peac march but let us look at the oversea comment i invit the sabc to make a summari of report in all the influenti newspap all over the world of the past two to three week then you will get the answer and that answer is simpli thi on that the anc and inkatha ar to blame for the violenc ye you have a right to protest but ordinari citizen also have a right to be protect you cannot march and then burn down peopl s car you cannot march and then break into shop and steal good from shop owner and as i said befor if the anc is so sure of victori and someon i think you impli that most probabl thei weren t we have not yet had the elect let us first have the elect the nation parti ha everi intent to come out as the strongest parti and the wai the anc now conduct itself we will come out as the strongest parti jeer venter thank you veri much mr botha thank you veri much we appreci a live audienc i remind you that a courtesi would be to give the candid the time that s still allot to them mr mbeki you have 1 minut left mbeki mr botha we need to understand the np need to wage a campaign to win elect i understand that but let s look at the actual you know the actual of thi countri is like what for instanc the goldston commiss said you know there ar veri seriou charg that have been made about who is behind thi violenc jeer no realli serious who is behind thi the goldston commiss doe not make those charg lightli i think we need to address those question serious i conced the object you have of battl to win elect that s fine but we must not in the process of that turn our back on the truth venter your final minut mr botha botha there is all over the world in all respons circl todai it s accept that apartheid is gone that is why the nobel peac prize wa award also to presid de klerk that is why the unesco peac prize wa award also to presid de klerk that is why the philadelphia peac medal and liberti medal wa also alloc or award to presid de klerk in other word it is onli the anc i think thei feel extrem sorri that apartheid wa abandon becaus thei ve lost their platform certainli the communist parti feel that apartheid should have continu a littl longer i have now reach the stage where we must realli object analyz our situat unless we fall in line with the modern and success industri economi of the world it wil not be a pleaseant thing to govern thi countri and the anc have not yet taken that step venter thank you mr botha modis again the opportun to ask the next question is still with anna mari mischk of rapport newspap and thi time the question goe to mr pik botha mischk mr botha four year ago when the anc and the sacp were unban on of the reason that were given by your govern wa that the communist threat had disappear or diminish to such an extent that you felt free to unban them becaus of what happen in eastern europ now veri soon member of your parti will probabl be in the same cabinet as some communist but suddenli a campaign against the communist parti and against communist ha becom a veri definit featur of your elect campaign what i d like to know now ha the nation parti had second thought about the communist laughter or is it just veri us to take the old bogeymen of the total onslaught year back from under the bed where you have alwai had the red what is the situat around the communist in the nation parti botha no we have never had second thought about the south african communist parti sacp but the moment you decid to legal an organ then you need not chang your view you need not start like them you then put your hope in the peopl of the countri to reject it that is the democrat wai and that wa the basi of our decis our concern now is that we were challeng by the sacp here i must sai not the anc but the sacp to prove that more than 16 of the candid on the anc nation list ar communist and we did so 25 of them ar and thi is of major concern not suddenli to the south african govern professor johnson an oxford academ wrote three dai ago in the london time that the sacp had too strong an influenc on the anc and that is pose a danger for south africa s econom growth thi is come from a well known and reput expert on southern africa but what is more imf economist share the same view so thi is not just someth that the np suddenli have drawn into the debat thi is there all the time and our concern is that not even the anc will be abl to resist thi firm grip which the sacp now ha on the anc jeer and that will preclud invest there s not a singl countri in the world todai where a communist parti is particip in an elect thi is the point i want to start make the anc ha the wrong alli we shed apartheid we got rid of that burden we admit the mistak that it wa i m wait for my anc friend to take the same bold step modis mr botha thank you veri much we give a two minut opportun to mr thabo mbeki mbeki the problem can i appeal modis interrupt let me appeal to the member of the variou organ pleas give the repres of your organ the opportun to state their case pleas thank you mbeki can i appeal to the np can you listen to what i m go to sai if you disagre with it when i ve said it pleas object but pleas listen you see the problem about thi issu is that the np ha gone back to old wai it s gone back to old wai the np doe not sai thi is what we find to be wrong and communist in the program of the anc which would be legitim to sai we believ that what you sai about thi or that or the other is communist and therefor bad for the countri the np doe not sai that which you can then debat the np sai you ve got secret file which show the follow about peopl i m sai it goe back to what it ha alwai done and what it s try to do the np is i think veri unfortun it s try to demon the anc to sai to the peopl out there it constitu that thi is a demon which must be destroi that is precis what produc the killer that we have on our street jeer brian mitchel who wa respons for trustfe said we did what we had to do becaus we were told that it wa an anti christ and we had to destroi it the np without a shred of evid in term of polici is sai that the countri is go to disast becaus modis interrupt mr mbeki thank you veri much and now the next minut s opportun is for mr pik botha botha i would like to repeat mr mbeki s appeal also give us a chanc to put our viewpoint and then disagre or agre i do not need to reli mere on np point of view on commun it s a fail system the world over it creat miseri in poland hungari czechoslovakia in bulgaria in albania in the 15 republ of the former soviet union it is a fail system it ha brought miseri to million of peopl econom miseri and social miseri and miseri in everi sphere of life so i need not defend the np polici in thi respect we sai it is inher a bad polici just as apartheid wa on and we ar strong enough and bold enough to sai apartheid wa wrong we shed it we re thrown it off and now we sai to south african pleas let us move forward modis mr pik botha thank you veri much your minut is up jeer cheer last opportun thi minut to mr mbeki mbeki minist you have absolut everi right to talk about poland and bulgaria and thi and that and the other what i m sai is i haven t heard on singl thing said by the np to sai in term of the anc polici as we understand it thi element is communist that element is communist the other is communist noth all that is happen is that the np is go back to it old wai the new np is go back to it old wai demon invok fear in peopl without a singl shred of evid to sai thi is the communist polici that the anc is go to implement becaus it s not there that is not true venter our next question from ferial haffaje of sabc radio haffaje on to monei matter mr mbeki thi countri s debt burden is well over 114 billion rand we pai 1 billion rand a month in interest alon how ar we go to pai our debt and creat job and build school and improv health care mbeki you ar quit correct there ar enorm challeng that face us as a countri becaus we inherit an economi that ha been in declin for a long time it is an economi that made million of peopl unemploi an economi that s made million of peopl homeless an economi that make children die of hunger now central and critic to what ha to happen to thi economi is we ve got to ensur that new invest consider invest take place part of what you ve got to do with regard to that issu is you ve got to creat the polit circumst the peac and the stabil that s import you ve got to creat the econom polici which sai to the investor thi is a safe place to invest you ve got to bear in mind that south africa is in competit with the rest of the world in term of foreign invest or invest gener includ domest invest that s a matter on which we ve got to focu to creat the polit and econom climat for that invest to take place that s the first thing and that is what we re battl now you ve got to creat the polici and that s the polici that the anc is put forward in term of an econom polici framework which make that invest possibl and then you ve got to address thi issu of the million of the peopl who ar depriv so that thei feel comfort with thi chang it s bring them someth i m sai it s possibl to do it venter the time ha caught you mr mbeki i m sorri mr botha ha a two minut respons botha the fact of the matter is that south africa thi bad place thi bad place is produc 40 percent of the gdp of sub saharan africa consist of 42 countri with a total popul of 500 million the fact of the matter is that the economi of thi countri is the envi of the whole of africa the fact of the matter is that when gener obasanjo a nigerian leader who land here for the first time and he flew the helicopt over pretoria witwatersrand area when i greet him he said to me i am suffer from shock i am suffer from shock i didn t know such a wonder industri area exist south of the sahara the fact of the matter is that anc member who go to other part of africa can confirm thi thei can confirm that thi countri is the hope of africa africa want us to succe africa said we have achiev so much and the fact of the matter is the remov of apartheid alon will not bring stabil and econom growth onli sound polici and be in line with the industri economi of the world todai and thi the nation parti can do and onli the nation parti can do thi that is why govern deleg on after the other sai to me unless the nation parti continu to have a decis role and a strong posit after the elect south africa will not attract ani invest that is a simpl fact applaus venter allow mr mbeki a minut s comment pleas mbeki the fact of the matter is that we have in thi countri a higher infant mortal rate than botswana ha it is a fact of the matter the fact of the matter is that zimbabw ha got more black engin than we have here that is a fact of the matter the fact of the matter is that thi economi with all the potenti that it ha ha produc i wa sai at least 5 million unemploi peopl laughter i wouldn t consid that a success i think it is failur it ha got potenti despit what the nation parti ha done despit what the nation parti ha done it ha the thing that the minist sai it doe becaus in realiti thi economi is much larger than ani of these other economi venter thank you mr mbeki mr botha could you wrap that up botha i would just like to give the fact as thei exist adult literaci rate for sub saharan africa 45 percent south africa 76 percent life expect at birth sub saharan african 52 year south africa 63 year infant mortal rate sub saharan africa 107 south africa 56 the fact is that we have not made 5 million unemploi across the world you have world tide of recess etc the fact of the matter is we have 2 million citizen from our neighbor countri that have flock to thi countri for job for train for educ for a better life if we have to send back those 2 million we would virtual have no unemploy problem the fact of the matter is the world and africa is wait for thi countri to produc a success stori the world opinion todai is that the nation parti and presid de klerk is essenti if south africa is to surviv thei ar essenti to plai a decis import role in the next elect and that is why the peopl particularli the black peopl must vote for presid de klerk that will ensur for them a better life jeer modis thank you again and right now the opportun to ask the next question goe to mr lesli mashokw of newslin and the question to mr botha mashokw mr botha you narrat the occurr of violenc in thi countri and you were state categor that the nation parti wa not involv in that the question is which govern is in place is it the nation parti govern whose polic gener ar now implic in third forc activ by the goldston commiss who is in charg of the secur process in south africa it would appear that whilst you ar busi woo vote from black peopl you forget that thei ar import and thei need to be protect seemingli you would want dead bodi to vote for you that is how your polit foe regard your view with regard to thi botha i m veri glad you put thi question becaus i think it is a question uppermost in the mind of mani of our peopl particularli our black brother the fact of the matter is laughter no but thi is a seriou matter and if you ar realli serious concern you will heed mr mbeki s appeal and mine the commiss found and said it would like to stress that the person name in thi report have not been found guilti of the alleg made against them not me sai it judg goldston the evid much of it strong remain prima faci until proven by a normal judici process but then commiss went on to sai thi the commiss earnestli appeal to all south african to recogn and appreci that as seriou as the alleg misconduct by some member of the sap mai be there ar over 100 000 member of the polic forc without the courag and honesti of major van vuuren and du plessi brigadi schoeman and colonel piet botha not all the botha s ar that bad laughter the commiss would have been unabl to discov the evid point to the network of crimin activ in other word what i am sai is there is onli on polic forc the major ar not white policemen we ar not go to have two polic forc and i am sai here thi even i appeal like the judg let us not becaus of a report implic and not yet prove not yet prove in the word of the judg condemn the whole polic forc thei ar there to protect all of us and thi is what the judg said and i want to emphas that here thi even we have been demor the polic by do thi sort of gener accus and condemn of the south african polic applaus modis thank you mr botha and now two minut respons to mr mbeki mbeki the problem is impli in the question the problem is that govern ha not done what it is suppos to do the govern todai wa suppos to issu an instruct that the polic would set up roadblock so that nobodi come in the johannesburg citi center carri weapon that wa not done jeer peopl occupi stadia in order to block meet from take place the govern doe not sai pleas go and remov those peopl so that we can have a climat of free polit activ it doesn t happen ye inde ye inde we ar quit certain veri mani polic peopl men and women veri mani member of the south african defens forc ar veri consciou of their duti and veri commit to ensur that thi chang take place but what happen dai in and dai out is that the govern doe not discharg it respons to protect thi process of a peac transit to a democrat south africa it doesn t give the proper direct it doesn t give the necessari instruct it doe not support thi honest botha in the polic laughter and that s the failur and there s a real real seriou problem the third forc issu that we rais for mani year wa deni by govern no it doesn t exist as a result of thi govern did not move when it should have move then we would not have had thi crisi that s the problem applaus venter thank you mr mbeki and a minut to mr botha botha i am afraid i total disagre thi is again typic of the anc blame everybodi els the common denomin in all violent activ in thi countri is the anc it is the anc and apla azanian peopl s liber armi it is the anc and dp it is the anc and inkatha alwai the common denomin is the anc the fact of the matter is thei have a respons and i think thi even the minist declar 10 district in johannesburg to be under unrest area the moment he want to do that the anc is against it the polic doe need certain power but we must act in term now of the tec legisl everi time the polic need addit power it is deni them why ar these power deni it is becaus the anc see some sinist motiv in some of these addit power and you mai well reach the stage where we mai have to give far more power to the polic but then it must be done in term of the tec venter mr botha thank you veri much your minut is up and thi time an opportun to mr mbeki mbeki part of the problem with thi discuss is the minist is avoid the specif what i am sai have discuss thi matter yesterdai with the govern about what wa like to happen in johannesburg todai and have agre that roadblock would be put and peopl search so that thei could come and demonstr without weapon why wa it not done have discuss all matter of thing for govern to sai there must be free polit activ peopl must not occupi stadia with gun thei must be stop why is it not done i am sai that ani number of specif instanc where there ha been failur of govern as a result of which peopl have di and that is realiti venter thank you mr mbeki well a final question then from freek robinson of agenda to mr mbeki robinson mr mbeki my first question i have tri to come down to the underli reason for the violenc and it is clear to all of us basic that thi polit framework in which we oper includ the basi for the elect and the basi of the govern in the next two year after the elect it is someth that is contest by other peopl there ar mani fear among the smaller parti in particular about the constitut and what might happen after the elect the fear is that you might win the elect convincingli even with a two third major and that you might scrap the interim constitut complet can you give me a clear indic tonight what exactli is it that you would like to chang in that constitut delet or add to it mbeki the first thing that i need to sai freek is that the anc with regard to these constitut matter that you rais the anc is bound by two document which were agre in the multiparti negoti on of them is the declar of intent that wa agre right at the begin of thi multiparti process we ar bound by that document secondli there ar constitut principl which ar contain in the interim constitut the anc is bound by those principl what do thei do that first document and the second on thei spell out a unit democrat nonraci nonfascist south africa entrench human right for everybodi regular elect a multiparti polit system an independ judiciari all of these question that is what thei spell out all of these provis that is what the anc bound to now the interim constitut that we have is a product of the process of negoti it doe not reflect necessarili anc view but i am sai that the anc would be bound to those basic principl it would also be bound to the notion that we need to take the countri not just anc support and anc member that is to draft a constitut it must be base on accept by the major of the peopl in the countri so that even if the anc got a two third major it would want to proce in a manner that take nation consensu clearli there ar mani thing in the constitut that need to be look at there have been mani debat about mani issu there is an outstand debat venter interrupt thank mr mbeki i am sorri mr botha now ha a two minut repli to it botha i am awar of the fear the concern particularli the smaller parti and of certain commun and not necessarili white commun also black commun of thi countri thei sai to us openli at time we were anc we know them but fact of the matter is we believ it is a good constitut and all constitut the world over it is not the end of constitut develop as far as i am concern it is begin of the new era that is what 27 april mean and i have the firm belief that the intern commun thi new world order with it new condit will simpli not allow the futur south african govern and we ar go to be part of that govern not becaus of favorit but that is the agreement between us and the laughter no but it s a fact we ar go to be part of it and a strong part of it becaus a vast number of black peopl ar of the convict ye thei would like to vote for the anc i sai thi openli but thei also sai but then the nation parti must be part an overwhelm major of black south african want a govern of nation uniti in thi countri and thi is import but the constitut basic is a good constitut it is a reason constitut it doe recogn a feder system and it doe make it possibl for all the provinc to retain a larg measur of autonomi and to be feder state and to preclud the interfer of the central govern in those matter which have been alloc to the provinc thi is how we must start there is no other wai we must now go into the elect test our rel support and start the new south africa so that we can get invest on condit that the nation parti is still part of the govern venter sorri to cut you off mr botha mr mbeki you have a on minut repli mbeki as far as the small parti ar concern we have throughout thi process made sure that thei were parti to these decis the whole multiparti process ha involv them if you look at for instanc what is now call the anc elect list you ll see mani small parti there and part of the reason thei ar there is so that we can ensur that thei ar repres in parliament if thei stood on their own thei would not win but precis to make sure that their voic is heard we put them on our own list so i am sai the anc mr pik botha is correct the nation parti will be a minor parti laughter but we ar sai that never mind that it is a minor parti it ought to be part of thi new govern becaus it is import that thei make a contribut on the construct of thi new south africa venter thank you mr mbeki mr botha you have on minut to close the issu botha i sincer believ that the best thing that can happen to south africa is that there should be no major parti after the elect that all of us must not onli be if i mai put it thi wai be forc by the constitut to form a govern of nation uniti but it must alwai be the choic of the major of south african that there should not be on strong domin polit parti and that is why i sai again there is onli on wai to achiev that in the elect and that is to vote for the nation parti and to ensur that thi countri will not be domin but i do not share those fear as i said befor the new world order will not allow the futur south african govern in my opinion to do as it like what is the danger is that irrespons element within the anc might exercis too strong an influenc in the anc venter mr botha thank you veri much that close off the question section of thi debat thank you applaus modis well obvious veri enthusiast member of the polit parti who ar here tonight right now we ar come to the end of the program we ar give the opportun a three minut opportun to mr thabo mbeki to make a statement on variou issu that he feel need to be known mbeki well i realli need to sai thi that as i wa sai at the begin the countri is face with a great opportun and a great challeng we understand the heat that get develop around elect campaign but we believ that it is the common respons of everybodi who in the countri consid themselv a leader of ani signific section of the popul of our countri to approach these matter in a respons manner we do inde believ that we need to develop a nation consensu around a number of basic issu on of those issu ha to be that it is a right of everi south african to vote to elect a govern of their choic therefor it cannot be permit that there is somebodi out there who consid themselv part of a leader of some peopl who want to block that process i think the countri need to unit to sai nobodi should be block from exercis that democrat right to decid what govern thei want that is an import thing the question of violenc the question of violenc is import we need all of us i am sai again to act togeth to resolv thi matter so that the anc ha the respons to sai to it own member thi is not allow ani other parti that is involv need to do the same thing but also the govern the govern need to approach thi matter to resolv the issu and not tie it to parti polit advantag to sai it is alwai the anc and the ifp that ar fight if thei meet and so on why ar the polic allow to watch as peopl ar kill themselv simpli becaus thi matter is defin as parti polit there is an intervent by govern that ha to be made i am sai that is a common nation respons wherev the violenc come from whether from the anc peopl or whoever that we must all of us act veri firmli and decis to address thi issu i think final i do not know what my time is like i think it is fundament wrong fundament wrong to sai of an organ like the anc that it s a demon it is the same anc that ha stood for nonraci for democraci and all of these thing which must bring the major of the peopl of thi countri into the settlement to turn round and sai thei ar a demon becaus what you ar do you ar creat a situat where we will not be abl to resolv the problem of thi countri if you take that attitud toward the anc you will then get that demon i think it is irrespons venter interrupt mr mbeki thank you veri much mr botha a similar three minut thank you botha it is quit clear to me that south african have a stark choic to make on 27 april a stark choic between those parti and particularli the anc that find itself in allianc with the wrong parti an anc that cannot disciplin it own follow cannot control them dure mass action an anc who allow individu to attack the industri nation of the world to attack the industri economi of the world and to sai derogatori thing about the imf and the world bank becaus in the new world order that is come the anc would have no choic and mr mbeki quit rightli earlier on about specif the whole issu of the miner right that must be restor to the state of the peopl i wonder whether the anc realiz what that ha done to the economi of thi countri and to invest of thi countri i want to warn the anc a govern cannot run a mine stai out of it but in the end i am encourag by the new that there might soon be a meet between presid de klerk mr mandela the king of the zulu and dr buthelezi and that i see that in the spirit in which mr mbeki offer with that i agre we ar all south african we onli have on south africa let us come to peac with ourselv and let us prai that these four leader will find a wai to reduc the tension that ha been creat in thi countri and let us prai for that and hope and hold thumb that that meet will be success we all need it we have onli on countri and we ar go to share it and histori will condemn all of us if we do not share thi respons there i agre with my friend and colleagu mr mbeki venter thank to mr pik botha there befor we leav the debat we ar go to ask each of the candid for a quick impress of the discuss we have just had start with mr mbeki mbeki well lester i think we should sai congratul to the sabc for afford thi kind of opportun i don t think there is suffici time given for real debat i hope that it would be possibl to organ so that we do inde have real debat so that i talk to my friend pik botha there so instead of promot the nation parti actual debat issu venter thank you veri much mr mbeki can we come back to mr botha pleas botha i am glad thi could take place in that we could openli canvass our view but perhap i don t know perhap we should do it in a more relax atmospher i do not want to reduc the enthusiasm of the audienc but i think we tend to lose some of the valu of argument on both side if the two speaker cannot realli be heard it is not a complaint and then lastli those who ar support of the nation parti pleas drive carefulli home those who ar not who am i to tell you how to drive venter thank you veri much for particip mr mbeki and mr botha modis and befor we sai good night the leader of the two parti the nation parti and the african nation congress mr fw de klerk and mr nelson mandela will meet in a debat similar to thi on on 14 april venter don t miss that good night 
FBIS3-20827: languag macedonian articl type cso interview with borko stanoevski governor of the nation bank of macedonia by vasko eftov and vesna m bozinovska place and date not given balanc between the govern s cours and the bank text our convers with borko stanoevski governor of the nbm nation bank of macedonia the former yugoslav republ of macedonia fyrom take place as call for hi replac ahead of schedul ar becom louder allegedli hi stubborn attitud toward certain question ha not won him great sympathi among certain member of the govern and while competit in the press about the name of hi possibl successor ha alreadi becom intens mr stanoevski in hi interview with vecer begin to speak sincer about these controversi issu vecer mr stanoevski it is precis in the monetari sphere that there have been open question about the negoti with the world bank that took place last week in skopj were the ambigu clarifi dure the somewhat delai visit of minist trpevski to washington stanoevski dure the negoti with the world bank the particular problem wa voic becaus of their demand that we be veri restrict with respect to further loan to enterpris that ar not liquid natur thei have demand that the govern or the nbm through it process reliev the bank of that burden and issu a regul through which thei would be prohibit from issu credit to enterpris that ar not abl to meet their oblig thi issu wa also present to a great extent in dicuss with the imf i person discuss the matter with the chief of the mission who wa here and convinc him that thi demand wa unaccept monetari disagr vecer wa the disagr precis the reason the negoti were abandon at on point stanoevski i did not abandon them i have never abandon ani negoti but on on occas we reach the point at which instead of increas the invest by as much as 21 percent thei propos a reduct of six percent we could not accept that and propos anoth solut the increas in the invest of the resourc of the bank could go up to 16 percent the fact that we were unabl to go to a variant growth in the invest so that thei would amount to 21 percent wa that the entir program could not be brought befor the board of director so we agre that thi should not be a criterion for fulfil the program we document our doubt that becaus of the fact that a larg number of enterpris were in particularli difficult circumst that instrument could not be put into effect we agre to consult a second time in the second quarter of thi year on the basi on the result that would be achiev dure the first three month the world bank suddenli demand that we refus to offer credit to enterpris that have great loss but those ar enterpris with a great number of worker some 20 enterpris have suffer 90 percent of the loss and have about 40 percent of the employe in the economi for the state that would be veri difficult to accept and a compromis solut wa found it wa approv by us and the govern a group of the 25 largest lose enterpris will after present conclud account be abl to us credit from the bank thereaft but onli if the govern guarante them but thi arrang is valid onli until 30 june and after that date the enterpris will be abl to us credit onli if thei ar creditworthi at the begin the world bank want such a decis to be made by the nbm even though i think that the nbm doe not have the author to introduc such a regul now it is necessari for the govern to do it and the nbm assum the oblig in the second quarter from the possibl growth of denar invest which amount to 608 million denar to ensur 300 million denar to be us onli by these enterpris we will devot the remain 308 million denar to the us of the remain enterpris the nbm will issu that regul otherwis as far as the method for grant credit to the greatest loser up to 30 june the govern held a special session at which each of it member had to declar whether he wa prepar to accept that oblig vecer januari 15 will be rememb as the date on which the board of director of the intern monetari fund met and the program had to be verifi but could that deadlin not be extend somehow stanoevski no the imf and world bank board did not set the date in advanc accord to the latest inform the meet of the imf board of director wa set for yesterdai i think that the program will pass without difficulti becaus we succeed in reach an agreement about these detail in the past few dai on 8 februari the world bank board will meet and i think that there will not be ani problem there either vecer it mean that the posit on our side ar also in agreement how is it that we found out on wednesdai that you had a meet with prime minist crvenkovski and other minist who ar involv in the work stanoevski everyth is in agreement there ar no open question all the technic problem associ with provid resourc for get through and settl oblig toward the bank should be complet by the middl of next month which will be follow by withdraw against the first tranch vecer will we pai off the debt ourselv or will there be an altern wherebi holland or the central bank in zurich will do it first and then we would settl with them stanoevski it will be a combin the main debt which reach it deadlin for payment at the end of septemb and amount to about 107 million should be paid at onc through the bank for transfer to the account in zurich and in conjunct with the netherland central bank later we will settl the debt to them either with resourc from donor or from our reserv otherwis up to now about 27 million ha been agre upon by the donor part of which ha been paid in advanc and part of which await decis by the govern of those countri those ar the percentag at the present time the donor assist will be about 35 million but the process of acquir the donor assist will be extend throughout the entir year vecer will the soro credit be left out of the combin stanoevski no the soro foundat is not left out of the combin thereaft to surviv we will incur debt of 25 million if everyth is pass by our parliament of cours expand independ vecer sinc mai last year the central bank ha gain greater autonomi in it activ abov all vi a vi the govern how do you evalu such a loosen trend stanoevski you see the central bank is quasi autonom in it activ which is a consequ of the constitut of the republ of macedonia as far as it work is concern the bank is basic respons to the parliament howev in the true mean of the word autonomi an independ central bank doe not exist anywher in the world as the bank direct monetari polici which is onli on segment of the macroeconom polici of a state which is propos enact and carri out by the govern here it mean that a veri close coexistenti and routin cooper must exist in that context it is understood that there can often be disagr howev there ar frequent discuss about the extent to which a measur from the aspect of monetari polici is accept to the govern vecer is there an unwritten rule about how much the central bank is independ in it work and how much the govern want to focu attent on itself stanoevski perhap there is some truth in that i do not know how to approach that question you should ask the govern that vecer last spring the legal decis need by the nation bank to enabl the central bank to gain a greater degre of autonomi in it activ vi a vi the state organ had great difficulti in get pass it is even said that the govern accept the measur under pressur from the imf it is also interest thi metamorphosi of the leadership of the nbm from our conserv attitud with respect to the monetari sovereignti of macedonia to the hard work at least under our circumst of take radic step for the greater independ of the central bank stanoevski we have not been conserv when the issu of monetari independ aros even though to a foreign it mai have appear that wai you know 1991 wa a veri except year in the parliament those preliminari step were taken for three or four month we had no elect govern the prioriti wa to get decis with polit substanc actual that year not a singl item from the econom sphere came befor the parliament vecer okai do you treat monetari independ onli as an econom problem stanoevski it is a multifacet problem in 1991 we made good us of 11 percent of the emiss from the nation bank of yugoslavia even though accord to the size of the social product we could have exploit at most 5 5 percent and bought currenc reserv from the nation bank of yugoslavia to the magnitud of 197 million dollar and that is 17 5 percent of the total currenc sold by the nation bank of yugoslavia for that year we did not bui that much currenc in the three previou year that year macedonia wa swim in gasolin so we began build currenc reserv vecer in what wai did the govern transgress in order to accept the measur for greater independ of the central bank last spring even though the member of the cabinet of mr crvenkovski did not in the end agre with such an altern stanoevski no thei did not agre thei were just indecis i tell you frankli that we were also hesit i endur great apprehens over the chang imagin we who for 50 year were on a fix cours suddenli had to chang to a cours determin by the market gener speak it wa not simpl meanwhil i must sai here that at the begin there were still mani progress in the govern who support thi program we had a much greater misunderstand outsid the govern in the econom chamber and in other institut which show greater skeptic commun with the govern vecer how ar your relat with the govern it is said that your stubborn attitud on that specif issu did not find you great sympathi among particular govern minist abov all those directli respons for the economi stanoevski no we have alreadi talk about that about the oppos interest which ar known vecer ye but we did not talk about the misunderstand that have been report about interest rate polici last year stanoevski okai we have discuss interest rate the govern adopt some recommend and resolut about interest rate polici which were creat here togeth we estim that the interest rate polici of the commerci bank in the first half of last year wa not set realist the economi rightli rebel against the high interest rate we discuss thi problem at the bank s council and the govern also discuss it at it own special session we came up with ident decis we charg the bank with re examin their interest rate polici vecer you sai that the govern discuss the interest rate polici at it session why should the govern discuss the interest rate polici when it is the respons of the nbm is that not just interfer by meddler stanoevski no the govern discuss it under pressur from the chamber and from a group of econom leader who demand an audienc with the govern otherwis the interest polici of the commerci bank is not within the compet of either the nbm or the govern vecer is it true that the central bank doe not have ani difficulti in carri out the inadequ interest rate polici in the commerci bank without anyon take administr measur against it stanoevski we do not have ani legal basi for such administr measur vecer don t you think that the nbm howev should be abl to regul interest rate polici with administr measur countri like the us until 1986 or spain until 1987 fix interest rate in the commerci bank us administr mean didn t thei stanoevski okai i agre that there should be some measur howev the measur should be base on indirect mean through monetari polici measur in order to cut interest rate and we will try to do that abov all through auction vecer were you on the same wave length as the govern when it wa a matter of the financi reorgan of the bank especi with respect to the format of an agenc for the financi reorgan of the bank stanoevski here we had a small problem now there is no kind of agreement there were two these we all agre that an agenc for the financi reorgan of the bank should be form as an institut which would be profession charg with that work and not as it ha been up to now by necess debat it wa complet a technic question should all the technic work for the agenc be conduct by the bank what should be meant by that technic and administr work no on defin it such a decis for a particular short period wa us in slovenia but it wa emphas that it should be duplic in our law our opinion wa that it should be an independ govern agenc and in the end our interpret wa accept on the contrari let s sai the director of the agenc in a wai would also be a director of a detach sector in the central bank i could not accept that with that the independ of a work unit would be statutorili establish have two master on the on hand the council and the govern and on the other a manag council of some agenc it is a good thing that there wa in the end someon who thought that it should remain as it wa vecer wa the law taken out or return in the assembl s procedur stanoevski the law wa not taken from the procedur it wa incorrectli introduc simpli befor the law enter the procedur we agre with the leader of the govern that a controversi articl would be expung moreov bekir zuta incorrectli accept it and transfer it to the ministri not further identifi which took the law out of the procedur when we saw what had been done we immedi correct the error and return the law to the procedur vecer how much do the state reserv amount to current stanoevski at the moment there ar about 122 million but that is subject to veri rapid chang with respect to the fact that the oblig to the world bank should now be paid the largest share of the currenc reserv ha been acquir through exchang transact we end 1992 with about 66 million in currenc reserv but now you see thei have increas by about 60 million of which 50 million wa deriv from exchang transact but the rest is from abroad actual we sold more abroad through the currenc market than we bought non immun of the polici vecer doe polit interfer with the work of the bank now an elect of three deputi governor is immin saban prevala is a repres of the parti for democrat prosper dusanka hristova is a member of the presid of the liber parti and dr gligor bisev ha been call up to now an independ stanoevski you see befor the end of last year we were left without a deputi governor in accord with my dutie i am charg with suggest the elect of deputi governor and of an act governor consid that for me as governor it wa the presid of the republ who name me and who can dismiss me i first acquaint him with the problem we examin two possibl option the matter could be left until the elect of the next governor or it could be resolv now in order for the peopl to ensur continu and to assum a portion of the governor s duti parliament select them and in the final analysi thei ar respons to the assembl and not just to me as governor we agre howev that it would be better not to wait for the expir of my term but rather to propos deputi governor vecer we hear that there ar some problem with the rule concern their appoint stanoevski well until yesterdai until the withdraw of the propos from the agenda i thought that there were no problem of ani kind where thing stand now i have not been inform in the public media i read that thi wa ti to my replac and that the nomin of the new governor and the elect of the new deputi governor should be postpon for a while vecer when will your term expir do you have the right to campaign for a second term stanoevski i cannot campaign for myself it is up to the presid of the republ to offer a nomin my term expir on 19 octob thi year vecer to what extent is there a possibl for you to be governor of the nation bank for a second time stanoevski that would depend upon mani circumst and it is most like that at that time it would be possibl for me to sai whether i would be a candid abov all it depend on who will be presid of the republ and what kind of composit the govern will have vecer when your term expir the presid of the republ and the composit of the govern will certainli be the same consid that the elect will probabl be even later stanoevski i do not know whether in the last month of their work the parliamentarian will debat the select of a new governor it is most like that would leav me in place after the expir of my term provid of cours that i wait through the end of the term and anoth few month as act governor consequ if thei want to replac me thei should do so now vecer in our convers you continu stress if i wait through the end of the term do you realli feel such strong pressur to resign stanoevski no i have experienc absolut no such pressur but recent the press ha begun to write about that vecer and just how much power doe the press have certainli it cannot replac you stanoevski no it certainli won t replac me i trust the press and i trust that you now have exact data and do not fabric thing you probabl know someth now that i do not vecer thei sai when all kind of stori begin to circul about a certain person in polit life then certainli thei ar try to suggest someth to him what is suggest to you by the stori that you have a privat bank stanoevski i have not heard these stori unfortun i do not have ani kind of bank and i do not have even on denar of stock in ani kind of bank my wife is in on bank in the credit bank and probabl that is the ground for the stori for me it is an unfulfil dream to have my own bank but i cannot get the capit sinc i do not have 150 000 mark vecer much earlier you chang the law which strengthen the limit for open save account previous other thing be equal would it have been easier for you to open a save account stanoevski if i made a mistak i made it earlier four or five year ago in the former yugoslavia i should have form a bank then scandal vecer speak about privat bank and save account is it possibl for us to have a scandal along the line of those of dafiment bank or jugoskandik bank stanoevski as far as i know a scandal ha alreadi arisen it concern a save account which call itself a branch of some belgian bank it promis credit up to 60 000 german mark with a hypothet deal with which it collect a lot of resourc from citizen and suddenli disappear anoth case and a much bigger scandal involv the situat with jugomarket stedilnica save bank as a result we made a decis that the licens of that bank should be revok the consequ ar known thei will not work either as a bank or as a save institut thei will go bankrupt and the deposit will be settl by the bankruptci court vecer what s go on with karic bank stanoevski karic bank of belgrad ha a busi branch in skopj which wa in complianc with the provision rule of the law on bank as it then exist but as such it wa not under the control of the nbm i spoke with the owner of karic bank and thei were categor that not a singl depositor would lose monei either interest or princip i promis them assist and that i would discuss with some of our bank give them denar credit on the basi of the hard currenc deposit and that the nbm would not treat these deposit in accord with the bank s hard currenc polici thu we would make an except in the interest of the citizen vecer to what extent do you work with the bank for foreign trade stanoevski in my opinion the bank for foreign trade ha not carri out the procedur for separ itself from the former jugobanka in the most felicit manner that is why from the veri begin of it oper it encount liquid problem toward the end of last year the liquid of the bank reach a critic point for pai into the save account of citizen as guarante by the nbm and thei began to draw on the resourc of the central bank at that point we issu a rule which prohibit them from us thi monei for other purpos while draw the resourc for the save account thi prohibit last onli 15 dai later we replac thi rule with anoth on which stipul certain measur to overcom the problem in three month we will decid whether the bank should enter the restructur process vecer have the ambigu regard the busi balanc between komercijalna and stopanska bank been fulli clarifi stanoevski no the busi balanc wa not fulli complet and i think that the entir work should be finish much quicker the two bank should themselv work out a mutual agreement it would be wrong for the komercijalna bank to think that it ha extric itself from thi there will be problem for exampl the stopanska bank could take advantag of some unfair practic the world bank the imf and the other intern financi institut should be inform that the disput between the two bank ha not end vecer and in conclus the competit for new macedonian bank note ha end how far ha work progress stanoevski the competit ha end but the decis on the bid have been review by a special form group which is under the auspic of the nation bank and on which artist scholarli and financi expert collabor in accord with their suggest we agre to make a contract with the win contest biljana unkovska who now live in slovenia she is to prepar six bank note with figur and six bank note with other symbol from our cultur and nation heritag when these ar readi we will decid which design to accept

how ar current indonesia us relat siregar you know that relat between indonesia and the unit state in the past few year have been quit good in polit indonesia ha been activ in solv the cambodian problem and thi ha benefit the unit state the indonesian and us govern have also work togeth well in intern forum such as in the asia pacif econom cooper apec and the uruguai round meet harymurti did indonesia and the unit state alwai hold similar view dure the uruguai round talk siregar of cours there ar alwai differ of opinion but we do not belong to the group of countri obstruct the uruguai round talk in econom ti our bilater trade grow steadili our export last year stood at us 4 5 billion and our import at us 3 5 billion while us export to indonesia stood at us 4 3 billion harymurti so bilater trade is more or less balanc siregar that is right from the indonesian point of view the us market ha great potenti us invest in indonesia especi in oil ga and mine stand at about us 25 billion while it nonoil and nonga invest ar at about us 3 2 billion the unit state is the fifth largest investor in indonesia after japan hong kong taiwan and south korea harymurti what is the impact on bilater relat of the us threat to remov gener system of prefer gsp facil siregar bilater relat ar quit cordial more than 10 000 mayb even 12 000 indonesian student ar now studi in the unit state mani have complet their studi and return home view from variou angl bilater relat ar quit excel it is therefor regrett if relat ar strain due to the gsp and human right issu harymurti the gsp facil involv onli a small fraction of indonesian export to the unit state why doe the govern appear to be nervou about the possibl remov of gsp facil siregar it is true that onli us 640 million were deriv from the gsp facil from our export to the unit state in 1992 which stood at us 4 5 billion but if the gsp facil ar discontinu thi move mai strain bilater relat as you know indonesia ha been view in a neg wai sinc the dili incid on 12 novemb 1991 thi problem continu to exist and mai flare up again anytim we wit us senat feingold s attempt to ban the sale of arm to indonesia we notic that the us press often view indonesia as a gross violat three preced word in english of human right and thi trend will emerg when the gsp facil ar inde withdrawn in februari therefor i hope a satisfactori solut to the issu will soon be found otherwis the neg consequ will be far greater harymurti howev the main problem li with the us congress and nongovernment organ not the us govern how do you cope with them siregar that is true the dili incid is the most difficult issu and thi will be a medium or long term issu we need time to solv it in view of the fact that the us polit system is differ from that of other countri includ indonesia we cannot sai that the main problem li with the us congress and nongovernment organ all of them should be seen as interdepend agenc the gsp issu is on exampl nongovernment organ such as asia watch and the afl cio ar the agenc that take the initi to have our gsp remov but it is the us govern that make the decis the same is true with the feingold amend name a senat tabl the bill but if congress had approv it the us govern would have implement the resolut to ban the arm sale therefor thei ar insepar my person view is that bilater relat should not be strain by the gsp and worker right issu harymurti there ar fear that onc the gsp is remov other countri will follow the us exampl is that true siregar that is possibl becaus worker right ar also part of human right harymurti what is the outcom of the ilo team s recent visit to indonesia thei said that some of indonesia s labor regul ar not up to the intern standard siregar i have not yet receiv a complet report on the issu but at a hear on 3 novemb 1993 the indonesian govern through it ambassador said that it would take step to improv worker welfar thi is not due to the us request hopefulli the govern will realli take step for the benefit of it own peopl and also as a mean to appeas the american harymurti what about the case of marsinah labor activist murder in east java siregar well it

and the attitud of the actual reform ar strongli influenc by the us model an orient to western europ could have alreadi reduc the hardest consequ of the reform but social secur ha to be financ and we must not forget that foreign aid ha been far less than promis the aid is mainli provid in the form of debt reschedul to return to the critic that the imf and world bank s condit ar exact too high a toll as yet there is no prospect of measur which would lead to a larg increas in unemploy in fact we ar even see that russian product is to be protect that import tariff will increas and there even seem to be talk of possibl price control in brief there is a real possibl that in a few month we will have a situat here which is just as catastroph as that in ukrain or romania perhap thi govern will then see that tough measur ar necessari and perhap the russian peopl will accept these measur if thei ar taken by former communist manag like chernomyrdin these polici ar not accept from an academ

a certain sober up hesit and doubt all the wai to a slow down now it seem that there is again a certain speed up what doe the present govern intend to do even though the period of it activ is curtail by the date of the earli elect to ensur that transform acquir an irrevers charact schmognerova first of all i would like to sai that thi question is slightli hypothet transform is an existenti necess and the outcom of the elect should not i hope chang anyth in thi regard the fact that the govern can slow down or speed up transform is anoth matter and a respons govern cannot view a complic process such as transform mere from the point of view of time narodna obroda all right let us be more specif what now and what later schmognerova first and foremost it is necessari to realiz that chang ownership is on of the basic task for transform the economi privat ha becom stuck and complic recent now that the govern ha decid to speed up privat by mean of coupon privat and standard method we mai assum that the whole process will start move again narodna obroda there wa often talk about part payment sale what do you think of thi option for exampl schmognerova part payment sale is on of the privat method doe thi realli have a posit impact in our situat realiti show that it doe not the new owner often ha troubl with pai the first instal let alon all the other therefor it is necessari to realiz that it is more effect to sell to someon who is solvent thi doe not mean that part payment sale will not be implement at all thei will not be given prioriti howev the fact that a new owner is not alwai a good owner is anoth thing for thi reason it is also necessari for exampl to consid that it would often be better to encourag the good manag of enterpris for we do have them so that thei take part in ownership it is necessari for exampl to reapprais manageri agreement and to motiv peopl let us sai by guarante them the option of purchas share in the event that the enterpris achiev good result incident there ar sever of these place narodna obroda the problem of the dire financi situat face mani enterpris ha becom veri pronounc and not onli recent thei frequent could do someth and knew how to do it but where is the monei to come from schmognerova we have somehow inconspicu move over to a differ packag of problem here also howev it is necessari to ponder the issu over a longer time frame in essenc i see a solut to the dire financi situat in the busi sphere on two level first and foremost in the busi sphere itself where so call bad debt from the past prevail here it is necessari to find a mechan for final rid these enterpris of these debt if thei realli know how to proce next we ar look for an effect mechan nevertheless it is alreadi clear that no mechan for clear debt will help some enterpris follow tough analys it is no longer possibl to hesit with liquid on the other hand it is also necessari to improv the situat in the commerci bank it is veri difficult to get credit at the moment the bank have consider financi resourc ti up in the enterpris and thei ar not even grant credit for propiti project the cautiou credit polici adopt by the nation bank of slovakia which wa react to the unfavor monetari develop in the fourth quarter of 1993 is also on of the reason for the shortag of credit narodna obroda credit realli is a special chapter do you see ani possibl of improv the current situat schmognerova i have alreadi outlin it on the on hand by help to resolv the financi situat in the busi sphere and on the other by improv the portfolio of the commerci bank it doe not just involv thi howev if the bank were to continu to administ themselv as mani have done until now we would not achiev much it is also necessari to make improv here narodna obroda foreign credit have been discuss for quit some time but there is still no signific chang why schmognerova look some peopl think that foreign organ ar hesit that thei ar wait to see what happen in the elect it is not like thi howev the negoti with the imf ar come to a head and negoti ar under wai with the world bank on a standbi loan and on credit for the financi restructur of the enterpris and the bank sphere and so on if these negoti ar success the wai is open for other line of credit mani potenti creditor often ask me will you receiv a standbi loan thi will be an import signal for them that it is possibl to have confid in slovakia the fact that despit the mani loan alreadi obtain there is a problem in draw on them is someth els there is a lack of good and propiti busi project thi should chang narodna obroda as we ar discuss the imf and the world bank these institut coupl the provis of loan to complianc with specif recommend howev compli with some of them often provok opposit schmognerova it is necessari to admit that these financi institut ar not charit organ credit from them have advantag repay period and interest rate but the state that want to obtain them ha to prove that it will not fritter awai the monei that it will us it effect and that it will guarante it return narodna obroda howev the major of the recommend will not much improv the current situat of less solvent and averag solvent citizen and some of the recommend ar not discuss much schmognerova there is no reason not to talk about them after all the implement of some of them is alreadi be prepar for exampl increas the state budget s revenu by mean of a higher tax burden or cut some subsidi narodna obroda thi is the veri subject of the increas critic schmognerova i realli see no press reason for thi inde thi involv categori of luxuri good and servic a mistak wa made when certain item that ar realli not luxuri item found their wai onto the list the govern will rectifi thi howev it is necessari to add that we would have had to adopt these measur whether we want to conclud an agreement on a loan with the imf or not so we were face with a dilemma either to adopt them which would have been reflect in price increas of about 3 4 to 4 4 percent and thu resolv the crisi situat in health care educ and in provid child allow or not to adopt them and irrespons burden the budget with a further sever dozen billion koruna which would have to have been paid in futur year or and thi wa also a possibl to condon the total collaps of health care and educ or get ourselv into a situat in which we would be unabl to pai child allow to the realli needi here is just on exampl why pai for some luxuri cosmet oper from the paltri resourc for health care after all thi is absurd narodna obroda and what about the issu of a later pension ag or lower pension schmognerova you have open a larg and sensit packag of issu so my answer will also requir more space thi involv a seri of social issu i would begin by sai that compar with the past the imf and the world bank have alter their approach to us and thu also their method of negoti while at the begin a year ago these institut came to slovakia with their propos for an econom program on whose basi the negoti were then held the approach now is differ we have drawn up our analys we have propos certain cours of action and we have sought a concessionari and accept solut narodna obroda for exampl then the issu of later retir schmognerova it is a fact that in western countri thi limit is higher than in our countri for exampl in

busi entiti in china have not been greatli reform in fact the lag in their reform underli the lag in all of china s financ and bank reform befor analyz the reason for the lag in reform of nation special bank it is necessari to summar the basic charact of the nation special bank becaus it is these characterist that plai a veri great role in determin the intern structur and behavior of china s special bank 1 region structur from top to bottom level by level the chines special bank have set up branch bank base on administr divis provinc citi prefectur and counti consequ the special bank ar superfici individu bank in a unifi nation bank system when thei ar in fact sever thousand rel independ local bank 2 intern administr rank system for histor reason the nation special bank have had the charact of govern organ sinc the date of their found thu the bank have fashion an intern offici standard stimulu mechan in which the pursuit of promot is the ultim concentr express of the individu effect of bank staff member and worker 3 mix of polici relat busi with busi relat busi 4 govern plan control credit busi becaus of the linger influenc of the plan economi model the govern regard the special bank as credit middlemen for plan distribut and as intermediari institut for payment and settlement whose busi is sole to ensur that plan financi distribut activ ar perform thei have becom an oper mechan wherebi product proce accord to plan and financ is subordin to product plan in a market economi environ howev the special bank do market style busi outsid credit plan insofar as possibl with a view to make a profit in the absenc of restrain law and regul thi kind of two track system of do busi can easili lead to disarrai in the financi trade order 5 the industri divis of labor pattern among the four larg special bank at the work level thi industri divis of labor creat a situat in which a firm borrow open an account and make settlement onli through a singl bank therebi produc a pattern in which a bank handl a firm s fund exclus the bank becom a firm s largest creditor therebi make it easi for the firm to shift risk to the bank 6 unifi state control over incom and expenditur as part of financi manag evalu of the special bank busi effect and individu earn have never been link to profit instead a semi administr agenc style unifi state control over incom and expenditur ha been practic in financi manag some profit retent pilot project were tri with some special bank such as the chines bank of agricultur between 1989 1991 but without success there ar two main reason why it is so difficult to move ahead with reform to convert the special bank into commerci bank as follow first ar intern reason i e the reason creat by the special bank s intern microstructur second ar extern reason quit a few articl publish in china have contain a fairli larg number of analys of the extern reason zhou ziyuan 0719 5261 6678 1993 xu jian 6079 1696 1992 but analysi of the intern reason have been few mani articl have said a great deal about reform that the special bank should make and thei have even gone so far as to provid quit a few idea about the reform step that should be taken xu maosen 5171 5399 2773 1993 howev just why reform of the special bank ha lag dure the past 15 year ha never been made clear all these analys impli on idea name that the govern ha not realli push reform of the countri s special bank if the govern realli want reform it could move ahead with reform measur unimped inde mani of the reform that china ha conduct dure the past 15 year have been compulsori institut reform that the govern ha push lin yifu 2651 3015 1133 1989 but why doe the govern fail to appli pressur onli on the matter of nation special bank reform in china reform of the nation special bank ha a bear on mani interest group to reform or not to reform how much reform and reform toward what goal depend on whether those that approv support and push these reform ar in an advantag posit to muster rel more strength against oppos interest group hu ruyin 5170 3067 6892 nation special bank reform is more difficult to promot than enterpris reform foreign tard reform price reform agricultur reform and taxat reform becaus these special bank plai a special role in china s modern econom and polit life thei have a bear on interest in mani quarter sinc thi reform would lead to a substanti alter of interest pattern possibl it would be veri riski 1 monopoli posit the monopoli posit of the special bank is a factor in the lag of reform in two wai first monopoli interest have led to insuffici motiv for intern reform now that financi market have enter a situat of strong barrier and a shortag of monei coupl with vigor demand and a fairli tremend gap between state control interest rate and market equilibrium interest rate the monopoli interest of the special bank ar enorm under these circumst for the bank keep thing the wai thei ar is prefer to reform that would damag their monopoli posit convers some reform and polici that might benefit the special bank monopoli posit such as central bank deleg of author elimin of credit control permit the special bank to provid full servic busi increas cost deduct increas bad debt reserv etc the special bank do their utmost to promot thu the cours of financ and bank reform in china for the past 15 year ha been weird on the on hand progress ha been substanti in reform the central bank s monetari polici and the develop of financi market while on the other hand the special bank monopoli posit ha not chang in the cours of reform meanwhil the effici of these bank ha declin their servic have not improv their return on asset rate ha fallen and the percentag of their bad debt and overdu loan ha risen second is the outward resist creat by oligopolist interest relationship by so call outward resist is meant the unit resist of the sever special bank to extern reform pressur in 1986 1988 and 1991 sever effort were made to implement substant reform plan for the special bank but none of them succeed thi situat show that sinc the sever special bank monopol the financ and bank busi a tacit agreement wa reach among those share a common interest in certain quarter to block or weaken the central bank s reform plan or monetari polici in fact ani major decis that the central bank make must obtain the approv of the special bank befor it can be put into effect sometim dialogu and consult such as joint confer and joint report to the state council must be emploi to solv problem unavoid the central bank must make necessari compromis 2 the govern s relat interest and hesit the govern includ the central bank ha never been resolut on the special bank reform issu the reason for the insuffici extern govern reform motiv ar as follow a fear that central govern s revenu might be impair the busi tax and profit that china s special bank pai have alwai been a main sourc of revenu for the central govern treasuri amount to about on sixth of central govern revenu in view of the rel great declin in the percentag of central govern s fiscal revenu sinc 1987 thi revenu ha assum greater import consequ when a given reform mai impair the central bank s earn the central govern usual find it hard to be firm b worri about carri out the govern s econom polici intent for mani year the govern ha declar that the nation special bank also have macroeconom regul and control function govern direct particip in special bank busi decis ha never chang thi ha three aspect on is that the special bank ar respons for all polici relat loan for govern design purpos second a substanti portion of commerci loan flow toward the sector or enterpris that the govern favor particularli loan to state own enterpris at interest rate that ar lower than the market equilibrium interest rate which is actual a form of subsidi and third the total amount of special bank credit ha a veri great effect on total social demand the prevail system help the govern regul and control total demand by control total credit therefor when the exist special bank system fit in with the macroeconom control system in certain regard there can be no demand for compulsori reform for the time be c certain technic factor in the cours of mani year of oper the special bank have construct a huge and complic intern system were thi to be fundament reform govern would not be abl to deal complet with certainli technic matter such as how to split up institut placement and transfer of personnel chang in the settlement system reschedul tax account and the divis of account for polici relat busi and commerci busi reschedul creditor and debtor relat with local govern etc worri about these matter mai magnifi the risk of special bank reform with the result that it ha never been possibl to make a decis 3 other extern factor the central govern the central bank and the special bank themselv ar the main decis maker in draw up special bank reform plan thei consult with each other and thei haggl back and forth howev in thi decis make process certain extern factor or on might sai extern condit for reform frequent becom the main topic of discuss or mai even becom the main factor affect decis these factor includ mostli the follow sinc china ha not yet set up a modern enterpris system no strong restraint appli to enterpris credit and liabil thi is a decis factor influenc the qualiti of special bank asset no market have yet been set up for the substanti flow of the kei element of product thu no profit equal mechan ha been form the entir interest rate system remain control thu interest rate cannot truli reflect the monei suppli and demand situat and monei s opportun cost the financ and bank busi taxat system and fiscal system is unfair thei frequent have a fairli pronounc administr interfer color etc thi situat ha produc two point of view on point of view maintain that it is necessari to wait until the abov extern condit have been reform to a certain extent befor reform of the special bank can make ani substant headwai onli then can some reform measur be inaugur the other point of view maintain that china s current econom environ is not an obstacl to special bank reform both the special bank and the aforement extern factor requir substanti reform at the same time but reform of the special bank happen to be lag now the author agre with the second point of view actual emphas the full necess for extern condit for special bank reform is a chicken or egg argument for which there can be no solut 4 the non support attitud of local govern under current condit in china local govern particularli provinci govern have no decis make author on the special bank reform issu howev local govern do have substanti power to direct the credit busi of special bank branch when the treasuri ha no monei go to the bank is the usual rule in the ey of mani local administr offici the local branch of special bank ar a second treasuri therefor the fund of the nationwid special bank ar cut up by jurisdict credit is local and how credit is us is subject to local govern interfer the main offic not onli is unabl to move monei around but it branch cadr effort to alloc and apport fund frequent meet with refus by or a plea from the local govern thi is particularli the case regard the credit busi of special bank local branch and sub branch and matter close relat to administr offic pet project and career achiev frequent local fund shortfal can be made up by have a special bank branch or sub branch dun the central bank or the main offic of a particular special bank therefor local govern ar larg satisfi with the present special bank pattern and it oper mechan thei maintain an attitud of nonsupport for ani reform plan that might chang the present situat thi nonsupport attitud make itself felt on ultim decis via variou channel 5 enterpris demand for special bank reform not suffici as far as state own enterpris ar concern particularli for larg and medium size enterpris on which decis have a substanti effect the limit on special bank credit ar veri weak for them the special bank mai be term creditor but thei ar actual supplier of fund the exist special bank set up benefit state own enterpris consequ the demand of state own enterpris for reform of the special bank is by no mean urgent on the contrari were the special bank to becom real commerci bank onli those abl to repai would be issu credit the poor would be scorn and the rich favor the toughen of credit restraint pose a threat to state own enterpris for numer state own enterpris that depend on credit to carri on in particular reform of the special bank would confront them with the threat of bankruptci larg number of nonstat own enterpris ar veri dissatisfi with the special bank system becaus their possibl of obtain credit from these bank is veri small therefor the urgenc of their demand for reform is strong howev nonstat own enterpris have no influenc in the overal decis make structur summar of the forego show that from the standpoint of four main interest group the special bank themselv the central govern local govern and enterpris extern motiv and extern demand for special bank reform is not great thi is anoth wai of sai that the exist special bank system ha had a posit benefit for the abov four major interest group for a certain period and thi is also the reason that reform ha lag the fact is that thi posit benefit stem from the tremend amount of credit that the special bank grant everi year and thi increas come from the central bank credit basic monei increas it also come from an increas in the cash balanc that societi need in the process of monetar the economi it is incom deriv from the issuanc of monei dure the next sever year the monetar of china s economi will slow thu the surplu incom that come from currenc issuanc will declin on the other hand the special bank s loan in be will not turn over the qualiti of asset will declin and a latent crisi mai appear 2 challeng that the special bank system face the special bank system ha been in oper in china for more than a decad as market reform intensifi the shortcom of thi system will becom increasingli appar therefor some analysi of the lambast and challeng that the special bank have born in recent year will help clarifi the object model for special bank reform 1 develop of special bank foreign financi institut sinc the advent of reform veri great advanc have been made in the diversif of china s financ and bank institut the financi reform path form outsid of these bank institut ha now enter a new stage eight small commerci bank foremost of which is the bank of commun includ the zhongxin industri bank the guangda bank the shenzhen develop bank the guangdong develop bank the fujian enterpris bank the shekou merchant bank the huaxia bank and the pudong develop bank have been in busi for onli a short time nevertheless all of their busi have develop veri rapidli as of the end of june 1993 these bank had loan balanc total 97 billion yuan or 4 53 percent of the 2 143 trillion yuan loan balanc of the four larg special

their oper their tight intern manag their high asset qualiti and their superior servic have attract quit a few talent peopl and busi from the special bank in place such as shenzhen and guangdong in particular the market share of the special bank had declin to around 50 percent the administr institut charact the cumbersom natur the ossifi manag and the not veri high effici of the special bank put them in an increasingli unfavor competit posit 2 the intern onslaught with the develop and widespread applic of scienc and technolog in everi countri of the world in recent year and with the tremend increas in the social and even the degre of internation of product and market financi reform have been conduct on a global scale in particular the busi and the organ of commerci bank have undergon profound and tremend chang these chang have enter china through intern exchang and thei stand in strong contrast to china s special bank system the model effect that the develop of bank outsid china ha engend in china ha stimul pressur for reform in china these pressur come from both within the special bank themselv and from outsid on onslaught that is particularli appar is the outflow from the special bank of mani expert cadr to foreign bank and other financi institut thi ha had a veri great impact on the develop of busi in the special bank the ossifi system technolog backward and the loss of skill personnel pose an even greater hidden danger for the futur such a lambast also mean that after china re enter gatt when more foreign bank will enter china and mai handl renminbi busi unless the special bank carri out basic reform thei will be at a futur competit disadvantag 3 challeng from the develop of china s market economi sinc institut of a market economi chines industri and commerci enterpris have gradual shift over to the market economi market economi principl have been incorpor into enterpris oper behavior enterpris demand for fund and financi servic ar also express in market law term given thi situat the special bank which mostli follow the former plan model do not fit in with the market style enterpris system for exampl the oper plan that enterpris have drawn up to meet market demand do not mesh with the special bank credit plan when enterpris need monei no credit is avail but when thei do not it the bank urg credit on them non state own enterpris that ar make good return cannot get loan but monei lose state own enterpris have plenti of credit avail thu these state own enterpris mai re lend monei at higher interest or thei mai not repai the loan or

the system thi creat havoc in the domest financi order the deepseat caus of which is the failur of the prevail special bank system to fit in with develop of a market economi 4 challeng of financ and

act on total social demand through the special bank the special bank have been the microeconom foundat for monetari polici howev the situat dure the past sever year show the action of the special bank to be at odd with the market economi becaus of the effect of all sort of extern and intern factor the loan that the special bank have issu have not flow into high output sector the result ha been a

is also on of the motiv for govern and central bank determin to reform the special bank 3 object model for special bank reform the goal of nation special bank reform is present clear it is to make

not look at it sole from the angl of individu bank second it mean that the four special bank will not necessarili be convert into four commerci bank thei might be convert into even more commerci bank thi would help shape a competit environ third the ultim goal of thi reform is to improv bank busi return and to promot the alloc of financi resourc through the market it is not reform for reform s

onc judg among the most under manag institut he had encount the bank s problem is not financi the equiti paid in capit plu reserv of the intern bank for reconstruct and develop the bank s commerci lend arm is dollar 26 6bn on which sharehold govern demand no dividend if the bank were mere to earn a 5 per cent real return on it capit it would be abl to support the current level of administr cost in perpetu thi huge subsidi must howev be justifi by perform here li the bank s challeng there ha been a broad recognit led by preston that an institut like the bank cannot keep on expand sai husain there is also a conscious that the bank ha to be manag you don t simpli manag loan and you don t simpli manag econom and sector work but you have to manag resourc and peopl improv in effici and reduct of cost have to becom an integr part of the work of the bank the task is made urgent by the critic of the institut and by the rapid with which the world continu to chang the bank s main long term mission is deem to be the allevi of poverti abov all in africa and south asia along with environment sustain develop but around thi core the bank must be tremend mobil in husain s word leviathan must learn to waltz befor preston s arriv the bank had suffer two traumat re organis on in 1972 the other in 1987 these focus on the bank s structur rather than on it process and procedur husain sai we believ that larg traumat chang of the sort that took place in 1987 leav behind so much debri that in the long run thei ar self defeat on disadvantag of such infrequ larg chang is that peopl do not take chang as a normal wai of life what we ar try to inculc howev is the idea that sinc the world around us is chang all the time so must we the other disadvantag allud to by husain is the effect on staff moral the world bank emploi highli qualifi staff who believ in what the bank doe but dislik the institut itself thi problem of poor moral wa greatli exacerb by the 1987 upheav in which staff were simpli told to scrambl for new job as in a giant game of music chair when preston came to the bank he found an organis still shatter by that event thi had reduc staff number by about 500 and creat four larg self contain region offic the cut prove to be temporari the number of regular staff at 6 406 last june can be compar with the 6 095 in june 1986 befor reorganis and the 5 665 shortli afterward the new structur cope quit well with narrowli region challeng such as structur adjust in latin america and the grow involv with china but husain argu that thi decentralis bank could not serv us well in provid a central driven respons to chang in the intern environ for exampl our work on the environ wa slow to take off our work on russia and eastern europ also took time to take off and abov all we took a long time to recognis that the wind had chang and that our constitu both in the develop and develop countri expect much greater rigour in manag and effici preston s initi effort wa to strengthen the centr by creat a presidenti offic with three manag director he also establish three new central unit in the area of sustain develop human resourc and promot of the privat sector a next stage wa to strengthen the bank s personnel and manag function husain sai that in the cours of the 1987 reorganis there wa an almost total demolit of the central manag and personnel capac there wa no unit that wa concern with busi process there wa veri poor capac on organis issu poor capac for recruit for an institut which basic ha onli on asset it peopl and inadequ manag of train and skill the main emphasi ha been on chang process but chang in process ar expect to affect structur as well thi sequenc from process to structur rather than the other wai around is novel for the bank it is

would be review within the divis with peopl in support depart with the director and with the region vice presid the second step would be a final project summari which would go through the same review process in the meantim much project prepar would take place after thi last review a mission would be sent to apprais the project the mission would come back and would prepar an issu memorandum again peopl would collect from around the bank to look at those issu then the vice presid would give the go ahead to write the apprais report thereupon there would be negoti with the borrow when the negoti were complet someon in the vice presid s offic would look at the final negoti project which would be sent to the board for approv what we ar do in the case of east asia is to have on simultan review at a veri earli stage we ar go to do pilot project on that basi the fundament thesi is thi review thing onc do thing simultan do them faster husain admit that thi mai all seem minor but everi year we approv 250 project at ani time the world bank is work on 1 000 project it also spend massiv amount on econom and sector work we believ it is through thi detail re engin that we will get to the issu of cost and effici thi will requir deleg it will involv a tremend amount of effort in select of peopl and in train it will also requir rationalis of intern inform and technolog the bank is in short try to get thing right first time for what ha effect been a government bureaucraci these ar huge chang with radic implic for deleg and train and for the qualiti of the peopl do the job as oppos to those who manag the peopl who do the job these effort at improv intern manag do appear signific but question remain over the effect of the board for exampl particularli in supervis the bank s manag and over the effect on the shaki moral and hunger for secur of a staff whose opportun elsewher ar limit both by their experi at the bank and by the g4 visa for foreign member which prevent them from stai in
