about uninterrupt contact between the ig and the us administr and it embassi in cairo can you explain to us what went on in these contact qasim thi is no differ from the issu of dialogu with the govern we did not contact the us embassi all these report of such contact ar li i can confirm that no contact have been held on ani level with the us embassi it wa the american who ask for contact but we refus it mubarak it is not import who began the contact but what happen in them qasim there were no contact there were attempt on their part which we reject mubarak how were these attempt made qasim the first attempt with me wa made follow my releas in 1988 and my escap for the first time from the sentri around my hous a lawyer came and ask for an appoint becaus some foreign want to meet me correspond and offici from human right organ in their countri the first wa a us correspond the second wa the chief editor of a yugoslav magazin and the third wa the first secretari in the swiss

to them in detail the violat tortur and detent to which the ig member were subject the dialogu went no further mubarak were other attempt made qasim the same lawyer came and ask for an appoint for the us correspond i refus and ask him to tell the american to send a photocopi of what he publish about our first meet in which i spoke about human right violat so that i might see the result of the meet otherwis why should we meet again mubarak but these attempt were made by correspond what about the us embassi qasim the onli time the embassi tri wa follow my arrest and while i wa in prison at the end of 1988 the attempt wa made through the same lawyer he told me that the embassi s polit offic want to meet me i wa surpris becaus how could he meet me when he knew i wa in prison the lawyer stress that the offici said he himself would solv it i told the lawyer to ask him first what do you want from thi meet when the lawyer return he said the offici want the follow 1 to get acquaint with me person 2 to be assur that we did not regard the unit state as the great satan 3 to stress to the ig repres in my person that the egyptian govern doe not us the us aid reach egypt to strike at the islam movement my answer wa to refus a meet we do not meet offici from govern and for us the unit state is the major enemi just like israel mubarak why ha the ig carri out act of violenc against tourism qasim there ar sever reason for the attack on tourism first tourism repres a massiv sourc of illicit haram state revenu thi revenu provid the rule regim with financi resourc that help it to stai in power we believ the regim should be remov so we decid to strike at thi activ to depriv the regim of thi revenu and hasten it demis accord to statist the annual incom gener by tourism is 3 2 billion about 1 billion the govern s own report admit that a limit number of oper by the islam group which cost us noth have undermin thi illicit revenu second tourism in it current form is pure evil it is an activ through which prostitut and aid ar be spread particularli by femal jewish tourist it is a despic sourc of a host of abomin tourism is also a wai for foreign intellig servic to collect inform about the islam movement so tourism is a certifi evil and must be termin mubarak but these act of violenc that you commit involv murder tourist were kill what doe the govern have to do with thi qasim some tourist should not be kill the target of our campaign is tourism not tourist we have taken sever measur to protect the live of tourist we have issu sever statement warn tourist against come to egypt where their live will be endang we have said that whoever visit egypt subject himself to danger becaus of our campaign against the tourism sector we have also sent messag to the compet author warn them against invit tourist for these reason have done all thi those tourist who still visit the countri ar do so at their own risk mubarak you said tourism is pure evil and a sourc of abomin thi is on of the reason you cite for the attack against the tourism sector but aid and drug ar not a result of tourism there ar countri that have no tourism but in which drug and aid ar widespread qasim the egyptian did not us drug befor the start of the tourism boom i agre that tourism mai not be the sole caus for the spread of drug but it is a major factor press report have repeatedli link tourism with drug aid and espionag mubarak suppos for the sake of argument that tourism wa the reason for the spread of aid and drug as you sai and that it is an abomin that should be chang why did you decid to strike at tourism onli last year when we know that the tourist area ar center in upper egypt where histor your influenc ha alwai been there must be other reason prompt you to strike at tourism otherwis why did you keep silent about thi evil you have exist sinc the mid seventi qasim tourism is basic permiss if it is conduct accord to islam rule but if a war is rage then why should the tourist come to these area when thei know thei ar in danger unless there ar other reason make them come mubarak for some time we have seen report of divis and split within the ig especi after the tourism incid when some dissid leader reject thi tactic thi analysi is confirm by the calm in sever governor such as al minya and suhaj where the ig ha a strong influenc and yet refus to particip in thi conflict against the secur organ what is your view qasim there ar no differ or split on ani leadership or base level insid the ig there ar no differ over tourism or ani other issu concern some governor nonparticip in strike at tourism there ar two reason for thi 1 reason that concern the govern the regim cannot open sever front simultan it ha not succeed in the battl it start in dayrut and will be unabl to decid thi battl even with the forc it ha brought in from cairo and the area surround dayrut so the regim prefer not to start new battl now 2 reason that concern the ig we have not decid upon a comprehens confront what is happen now is prepar onli a heat up it is in our interest at the preparatori stage to maintain base in calm governor so that thei can oper calmli in accord with the plan prepar for them and achiev what is requir of them briefli we ar the on who will decid when and who will move these governor ar requir to remain calm their role ha not come yet mubarak you issu a statement sai that invest will soon be the target of ig oper when will you carri out violent act against invest qasim the time for strike at invest depend on sever circumst these includ the natur of the egyptian secur organ perform against us and then our assess of the conflict with the state if the state opt for a new escal against the ig then the invest sector will be the target of reveng as a kind of deterr mubarak in which case you will not have the religi ground you cite for the attack on tourism what ar your reason for the campaign against invest qasim we seek to destroi all the state organ and facil with the least possibl bloodsh the task is easi a singl ig militari unit can strike at invest in egypt when the time is right mubarak the militari oper you direct against tourism have cost you a lot the secur organ have erad the ig influenc in mani area most of the major ig leader ar in jail did the ig make an error of judgment when it took it struggl against the state to the highest level with the attack on such an import sector as tourism qasim i beg to differ with your us of the term the highest possibl level what ha happen in our struggl with the state is veri limit and onli in line with the stage we adopt in our effort to weaken the state thi is just a prelud to an all out confront the current level of confront is onli the begin the major struggl ha not begun besid the secur organ have no clue as to the ig structur for exampl the recur announc by secur offici that thei have elimin 99 percent of ig member contradict the daili press report about the arrest of dozen even hundr of peopl mubarak i feel that with your campaign against tourism you have launch a lose even suicid battl the ensu secur effort have undercut your oper qasim the ig is still aliv and will remain unshaken all the secur strike have been ineffectu at ani rate our religi duti is to engag in jihad not to reach a particular outcom we take the right path and god almighti decid on the outcom we do what the shari ah tell us to do with regard to establish the islam state if the outcom is victori that is fine with us if it is death that too is fine mubarak there have been report about a dialogu between yourself and the secur offici follow your releas in 1988 what wa that about qasim first there wa no dialogu involv despit recent report concern a mediat committe when i wa under hous arrest after my releas in 1988 major gener sa id thabit of the intern state secur servic summon me and told me the act of violenc wage by the ig in south egypt ayn sham a cairo suburb and other area must end i state the ig condit for end violenc thei ar 1 ig detaine and prison should be releas 2 propag activ should be legal ig mosqu must not be sequest 3 tortur and the hold of hostag should be end the secur offici did not agre on the contrari thei strengthen the guard dure my hous arrest in 1988 after flee my hous and my arrest in 1989 the same offici came back and ask me to stop the violenc particularli in ayn sham which ha wit a notic escal in the ig oper against the polic i repeat what i said about the condit i mention again these were reject that is the stori there wa no dialogu there will not be on mubarak but there ar confirm report that a mediat committe of religi scholar wa coordin and organ the dialogu between the ig leader in prison and secur offici and that that wa the reason the govern dismiss interior minist abd al halim musa a parti to the dialogu qasim there wa no dialogu apart from what i said earlier no ig leader insid the prison or outsid have met religi scholar or secur offici the mediat stori wa fabric we issu a statement dismiss the idea of dialogu or mediat our posit is clear in thi regard there can be no truce or reconcili with the regim the issu is confront between the two parti until on finish the other off or the islam system is fulli appli mubarak doe thi mean the ig insist on reject ani dialogu design to stop the bloodsh and violenc qasim we will enter no dialogu unless on of two case appli 1 it is dialogu with the state secur and govern shaykh and ulema with a view to dismiss the suspicion thei rais occasion about our ideolog thi is our duti and we call for it 2 in the event of our achiev power we might negoti with the kei figur of the outgo author about the condit for their exit from the countri mubarak but the inform indic that abbud al zumur wa a parti to the dialogu qasim thi never happen what wa report wa untru and deni by abbud al zumur mubarak what about press report attribut to safwat abd al ghani regard the mediat committe in which he confirm the exist of a dialogu qasim first safwat abd al ghani s statement were distort second i am the on who offici express the ig posit i onli discuss the mediat issu to deni it exist mubarak mani observ believ the ig ha lost on everi level and that the secur servic have elimin it threat what do you think qasim thi is wrong at the militari level

these ar 1 the militari coup work on thi level is afoot the state know noth about it and it secur organ ar preoccupi with minor incid carri out by ig youth in upper egypt 2 the mass action when the islam revolut take place it must be accompani by a widespread mass action thi is vital to prevent foreign intervent or at least to have the action imped intervent for 18 dai accord to our militari peopl mani of the demonstr we organ were meant among other thing to train the ig cadr in mass action we have expertis in thi field 3 the special oper axi thi action is necessari to assassin some

know about their group which is no us to the secur forc sinc the group is complet separ and ha no link with the other group mubarak i feel you ar exagger the militari action we have not heard about militari group belong to the ig and the intellig servic ha arrest no element affili to you what proof do you have qasim the event of 1981 the kill of al sadat answer you the secur organ had no idea about the ig militari wing thi is the most convinc answer the arrest or nonarrest of militari element doe not mean there ar or ar not militari group gener speak there were militari peopl in the al jihad case mubarak the militari who left servic or were accus in the al jihad case were offic noncommiss offic and soldier thei had no influenc suppos that what you sai about a presenc in thi sector is true thi doe not mean there is ani real danger what do you think qasim i beg to differ with you the influenti forc ar the minor offic and the situat in the militari unit confirm thi soldier do not get their order from high rank offic such as a brigadi gener and abov we ar convinc of the import of the lower rank thi is a lesson from histori thei ar the motiv mubarak what ar the detail of the coup plan you prepar in 1981 and whose spark wa the attack on the review stand on presid al sadat qasim the plan wa base on sever ax militari action to seiz control of the main center such as the oper room the defens ministri the interior ministri the televis and radio build and the import bridg the plan also call for the issuanc of fabric statement attribut to variou armi unit express support for the islam revolut in order to confus the armi command and paralyz it activ at the same time arm element would move to kill some influenti state figur or those who would attempt to ride the popular wave the peopl would then go down to the street to prevent foreign intervent we also had an altern plan that wa to be implement in an emerg thi is the on that wa carri out in 1981 after the arrest of a number of leader includ myself dure the septemb campaign the organ decid to implement the emerg plan for fear that the secur servic mai have learn about the organ after our arrest the emerg plan wa amend after we learn that khalid al islambuli ha been select to particip in the militari parad the leadership wa hesit whether to go ahead with the plan to assassin al sadat or not the brother in

egypt to inform the other leader about the plan but he could not get to asyut becaus the polic had establish checkpoint along the road usamah wa forc to chang hi itinerari therefor the assassin oper came as a surpris to the upper egypt leader thei thought that the fact that thei had not receiv inform about the assassin plan meant that the plan ha been postpon thei wait for two dai in order to prepar for the movement that began on the first dai of the holidai thei succeed in seiz control of the asyut governor and the secur director but the secur forc were abl after mani hour to regain

about uninterrupt contact between the ig and the us administr and it embassi in cairo can you explain to us what went on in these contact qasim thi is no differ from the issu of dialogu with the govern we did not contact the us embassi all these report of such contact ar li i can confirm that no contact have been held on ani level with the us embassi it wa the american who ask for contact but we refus it mubarak it is not import who began the contact but what happen in them qasim there were no contact there were attempt on their part which we reject mubarak how were these attempt made qasim the first attempt with me wa made follow my releas in 1988 and my escap for the first time from the sentri around my hous a lawyer came and ask for an appoint becaus some foreign want to meet me correspond and offici from human right organ in their countri the first wa a us correspond the second wa the chief editor of a yugoslav magazin and the third wa the first secretari in the swiss embassi i began by ask them why ar you interest in meet me the swiss emphas that the aim wa to learn the violat to which the ig and it member were subject in prison so as to inform hi govern which would then pressur the egyptian govern the american and the yugoslav said the meet wa import to them as correspond and becaus thei recogn me as a sourc of inform on what wa happen in egypt i explain to them in detail the violat tortur and detent to which the ig member were subject the dialogu went no further mubarak were other attempt made qasim the same lawyer came and ask for an appoint for the us correspond i refus and ask him to tell the american to send a photocopi of what he publish about our first meet in which i spoke about human right violat so that i might see the result of the meet otherwis why should we meet again mubarak but these attempt were made by correspond what about the us embassi qasim the onli time the embassi tri wa follow my arrest and while i wa in prison at the end of 1988 the attempt wa made through the same lawyer he told me that the embassi s polit offic want to meet me i wa surpris becaus how could he meet me when he knew i wa in prison the lawyer stress that the offici said he himself would solv it i told the lawyer to ask him first what do you want from thi meet when the lawyer return he said the offici want the follow 1 to get acquaint with me person 2 to be assur that we did not regard the unit state as the great satan 3 to stress to the ig repres in my person that the egyptian govern doe not us the us aid reach egypt to strike at the islam movement my answer wa to refus a meet we do not meet offici from govern and for us the unit state is the major enemi just like israel mubarak why ha the ig carri out act of violenc against tourism qasim there ar sever reason for the attack on tourism first tourism repres a massiv sourc of illicit haram state revenu thi revenu provid the rule regim with financi resourc that help it to stai in power we believ the regim should be remov so we decid to strike at thi activ to depriv the regim of thi revenu and hasten it demis accord to statist the annual incom gener by tourism is 3 2 billion pound about 1 billion the govern s own report admit that a limit number of oper by the islam group which cost us noth have undermin thi illicit revenu second tourism in it current form is pure evil it is an activ through which prostitut and aid ar be spread particularli by femal jewish tourist it is a despic sourc of a host of abomin tourism is also a wai for foreign intellig servic to collect inform about the islam movement so tourism is a certifi evil and must be termin mubarak but these act of violenc that you commit involv murder tourist were kill what doe the govern have to do with thi qasim some tourist should not be kill the target of our campaign is tourism not tourist we have taken sever measur to protect the live of tourist we have issu sever statement warn tourist against come to egypt where their live will be endang we have said that whoever visit egypt subject himself to danger becaus of our campaign against the tourism sector we have also sent messag to the compet author warn them against invit tourist for these reason have done all thi those tourist who still visit the countri ar do so at their own risk mubarak you said tourism is pure evil and a sourc of abomin thi is on of the reason you cite for the attack against the tourism sector but aid and drug ar not a result of tourism there ar countri that have no tourism but in which drug and aid ar widespread qasim the egyptian did not us drug befor the start of the tourism boom i agre that tourism mai not be the sole caus for the spread of drug but it is a major factor press report have repeatedli link tourism with drug aid and espionag mubarak suppos for the sake of argument that tourism wa the reason for the spread of aid and drug as you sai and that it is an abomin that should be chang why did you decid to strike at tourism onli last year when we know that the tourist area ar center in upper egypt where histor your influenc ha alwai been there must be other reason prompt you to strike at tourism otherwis why did you keep silent about thi evil you have exist sinc the mid seventi qasim tourism is basic permiss if it is conduct accord to islam rule but if a war is rage then why should the tourist come to these area when thei know thei ar in danger unless there ar other reason make them come mubarak for some time we have seen report of divis and split within the ig especi after the tourism incid when some dissid leader reject thi tactic thi analysi is confirm by the calm in sever governor such as al minya and suhaj where the ig ha a strong influenc and yet refus to particip in thi conflict against the secur organ what is your view qasim there ar no differ or split on ani leadership or base level insid the ig there ar no differ over tourism or ani other issu concern some governor nonparticip in strike at tourism there ar two reason for thi 1 reason that concern the govern the regim cannot open sever front simultan it ha not succeed in the battl it start in dayrut and will be unabl to decid thi battl even with the forc it ha brought in from cairo and the area surround dayrut so the regim prefer not to start new battl now 2 reason that concern the ig we have not decid upon a comprehens confront what is happen now is prepar onli a hot up it is in our interest at the preparatori stage to maintain base in calm governor so that thei can oper calmli in accord with the plan prepar for them and achiev what is requir of them briefli we ar the on who will decid when and who will move these governor ar requir to remain calm their role ha not come yet mubarak you issu a statement sai that invest will soon be the target of ig oper when will you carri out violent act against invest qasim the time for strike at invest depend on sever circumst these includ the natur of the egyptian secur organ perform against us and then our assess of the conflict with the state if the state opt for a new escal against the ig then the invest sector will be the target of reveng as a kind of deterr mubarak in which case you will not have the religi ground you cite for the attack on tourism what ar your reason for the campaign against invest qasim we seek to destroi all the state organ and facil with the least possibl bloodsh the task is easi a singl ig militari unit can strike at invest in egypt when the time is right mubarak the militari oper you direct against tourism have cost you a lot the secur organ have erad the ig influenc in mani area most of the major ig leader ar in jail did the ig make an error of judgment when it took it struggl against the state to the highest level with the attack on such an import sector as tourism qasim i big to differ with your us of the term the highest possibl level what ha happen in our struggl with the state is veri limit and onli in line with the stage we adopt in our effort to weaken the state thi is just a prelud to an all out confront the current level of confront is onli the begin the major struggl ha not begun besid the secur organ have no clue as to the ig structur for exampl the recur announc by secur offici that thei have elimin 99 percent of ig member contradict the daili press report about the arrest of dozen even hundr of peopl mubarak i feel that with your campaign against tourism you have launch a lose even suicid battl the ensu secur effort have undercut your oper qasim the ig is still aliv and will remain unshaken all the secur strike have been ineffectu at ani rate our religi duti is to engag in jihad not to reach a particular outcom we take the right path and god almighti decid on the outcom we do what the shari ah tell us to do with regard to establish the islam state if the outcom is victori that is fine with us if it is death that too is fine mubarak there have been report about a dialogu between yourself and the secur offici follow your releas in 1988 what wa that about qasim first there wa no dialogu involv despit recent report concern a mediat committe when i wa under hous arrest after my releas in 1988 major gener sa id thabit of the intern state secur servic summon me and told me the act of violenc wage by the ig in south egypt ayn sham a cairo suburb and other area must end i state the ig condit for end violenc thei ar 1 ig detaine and prison should be releas 2 propag activ should be legal ig mosqu must not be sequest 3 tortur and the hold of hostag should be end the secur offici did not agre on the contrari thei strengthen the guard dure my hous arrest in 1988 after flee my hous and my arrest in 1989 the same offici came back and ask me to stop the violenc particularli in ayn sham which ha wit a notic escal in the ig oper against the polic i repeat what i said about the condit i mention again these were reject that is the stori there wa no dialogu there will not be on mubarak but there ar confirm report that a mediat committe of religi scholar wa coordin and organ the dialogu between the ig leader in prison and secur offici and that that wa the reason the govern dismiss interior minist abd al halim musa a parti to the dialogu qasim there wa no dialogu apart from what i said earlier no ig leader insid the prison or outsid have met religi scholar or secur offici the mediat stori wa fabric we issu a statement dismiss the idea of dialogu or mediat our posit is clear in thi regard there can be no truce or reconcili with the regim the issu is confront between the two parti until on finish the other off or the islam system is fulli appli mubarak doe thi mean the ig insist on reject ani dialogu design to stop the bloodsh and violenc qasim we will enter no dialogu unless on of two case appli 1 it is dialogu with the state secur and govern shaykh and ulema with a view to dismiss the suspicion thei rais occasion about our ideolog thi is our duti and we call for it 2 in the event of our achiev power we might negoti with the kei figur of the outgo author about the condit for their exit from the countri mubarak but the inform indic that abbud al zumur wa a parti to the dialogu qasim thi never happen what wa report wa untru and deni by abbud al zumur mubarak what about press report attribut to safwat abd al ghani regard the mediat committe in which he confirm the exist of a dialogu qasim first safwat abd al ghani s statement were distort second i am the on who offici express the ig posit i onli discuss the mediat issu to deni it exist mubarak mani observ believ the ig ha lost on everi level and that the secur servic have elimin it threat what do you think qasim thi is wrong at the militari level although the all out confront ha not start and the struggl is still at it preparatori stage the state ha fail to decid a singl battl the dayrut battl ha not been decid despit the massiv forc brought in from the other governor inde the ig member in dayrut exhaust the govern strength and confus it forc militari superior favor the ig we maintain a presenc in 18 governor and their score of town and hundr of villag the state ha fail to decid even a small battl in on of the 13 town of asyut governor and asyut is onli on of 18 governor in which we ar present on the polit level the state is suffer variou polit crise the polit forc reject of mubarak s nomin is perhap the best exampl on the econom level simpl strike that cost us noth enabl us to obstruct the tourism sector the state is suffer an econom crisi that ha been deepen by tourism problem the variou level of struggl have ad to the ig firm i conclud from thi that the ig curv is go upward contrari to what some peopl imagin mubarak i disagre first the ig mosqu known for their activ role have been taken by the govern second you give govern failur to decid the battl in dayrut as evid that the ig is still strong but the govern end your influenc in mani other region like imbabah ayn sham qina aswan and damietta the ig doe not exist there the ig arm element were liquid as mani member were kill final that arriv from afghanistan ar be us mean the ig is us it last line of defens qasim thi is not true statement by secur leader indic that we have kill more of them than thei have kill of us sinc 1981 what you said about govern success in region like aswan imbabah and qina is not true either although in the past we us mosqu to propag the messag we did not stop when the govern control the mosqu the ig invent method to continu it activ such as us direct video transmiss audio cassett and variou public and educ member in apart instead of mosqu becaus of the secur situat allow us to intensifi our program in short our activ is continu but the method and mean have chang the particip of ig member in afghanistan in the current struggl in egypt wa intend from the begin those member were schedul to return anywai your think that thei ar the last line is wrong thei ar just the begin of the struggl anywai i won t go into more detail about thi point mubarak what ar the ig pole of action now qasim there ar three pole of action these ar 1 the militari coup work on thi level is afoot the state know noth about it and it secur organ ar preoccupi with minor incid carri out by ig youth in upper egypt 2 the mass action when the islam revolut take place it must be accompani by a widespread mass action thi is vital to prevent foreign intervent or at least to have the action imped intervent for 18 dai accord to our militari peopl mani of the demonstr we organ were meant among other thing to train the ig cadr in mass action we have expertis in thi field 3 the special oper axi thi action is necessari to assassin some offici it is the stage of heat thing up thi organ ha gain expertis by implement oper it is readi now and ha a role in implement the plan thi organ is in action and will not stop the assassin act as long as there ar circumst that requir them it is wrong for anyon to think that the arrest of it member or the halt of it activ for some time mean an imbal action is taken in accord with a plan drawn up for thi organ s work the state know noth about the militari organ that is respons for prepar the militari coup it know noth about the special oper organ when some of it member ar arrest thei onli know about their group which is no us to the secur forc sinc the group is complet separ and ha no link with the other group mubarak i feel you ar exagger the militari action we have not heard about militari group belong to the ig and the intellig servic ha arrest no element affili to you what proof do you have qasim the event of 1981 the kill of al sadat answer you the secur organ had no idea about the ig militari wing thi is the most convinc answer the arrest or nonarrest of militari element doe not mean there ar or ar not militari group gener speak there were militari peopl in the al jihad case mubarak the militari who left servic or were accus in the al jihad case were offic noncommiss offic and soldier thei had no influenc suppos that what you sai about a presenc in thi sector is true thi doe not mean there is ani real danger what do you think qasim i beg to differ with you the influenti forc ar the minor offic and the situat in the militari unit confirm thi soldier do not get their order from high rank offic such as a brigadi gener and abov we ar convinc of the import of the lower rank thi is a lesson from histori thei ar the motiv mubarak what ar the detail of the coup plan you prepar in 1981 and whose spark wa the attack on the review stand against presid al sadat qasim the plan wa base on sever ax militari action to seiz control of the main center such as the oper room the defens ministri the interior ministri the televis and radio build and the import bridg the plan also call for the issuanc of fabric statement attribut to variou armi unit express support for the islam revolut in order to confus the armi command and paralyz it activ at the same time arm element would move to kill some influenti state figur or those who would attempt to ride the popular wave the peopl would then go down to the street to prevent foreign intervent we also had an altern plan that wa to be implement in an emerg thi is the on that wa carri out in 1981 after the arrest of a number of leader includ myself dure the septemb campaign the organ decid to implement the emerg plan for fear that the secur servic mai have learn about the organ after our arrest the emerg plan wa amend after we learn that khalid al islambuli ha been select to particip in the militari parad the leadership wa hesit whether to go ahead with the plan to assassin al sadat or not the brother in cairo decid to carri out the assassin plan and that the shot to be fire by al islambuli would herald the start of the revolut and the movement in cairo and asyut usamah hafiz wa ask to travel to upper egypt to inform the other leader about the plan but he could not get to asyut becaus the polic had establish checkpoint along the road usamah wa forc to chang hi itinerari therefor the assassin oper came as a surpris to the upper egypt leader thei thought that the fact that thei had not receiv inform about the assassin plan meant that the plan ha been postpon thei wait for two dai in order to prepar for the movement that began on the first dai of the holidai thei succeed in seiz control of the asyut governor and the secur director but the secur forc were abl after mani hour to regain control of the governor and the plan fail in cairo mubarak how did khalid al islambuli join the ig qasim khalid is the younger brother of muhammad shawqi al islambuli on of the founder of the ig muhammad invit him to join the group and he did he began attend the weekli meet we held in al rahmah mosqu we decid to accept him as a member and i wa hi amir in the naja hammadi group he wa full of enthusiasm he ask me more than onc to give him permiss to direct hi unit s gun at the presidenti palac where al sadat live he wa an offic in the artilleri corp i us to calm him down and hint to him that someth wa be prepar and he should wait later i includ khalid in the group respons for carri out the coup

our own reason and we leav it to other to find their scheme we expect our lack of comment to carri mean but what i would like to sai is that we still hold our view on the matter of extradit to egypt we ar sai that if the us govern extradit dr abd al rahman to egypt it will have made a great mistak and a needless on becaus thei have gone thi far with their trickeri and fabric a charg against him

director of al jama ah al islamiyah s us offic the charg that the leader of al jama ah wa behind hi murder is an invalid charg becaus anywai a muslim would not dare kill anoth muslim or encourag other to do so third we believ that the aim of spread these rumor is to draw attent awai from the real killer who brutal kill mustafa shalabi salah al din and who wa that qasim we believ it wa the mosad isra intellig there wa a close relationship between al sayyid nusayr who kill meir kahan and mustafa shalabi we know that the mosad had inform confirm that shalabi wa the planner of kahan s assassin salah al din doe that mean that there were no disput between abd al rahman and shalabi qasim there were no basic differ that would lead to such an act the differ were in their point of view as regard administr their work salah al din what is al jama ah al islamiyah who ar it member what is the differ between it and the islam jihad and al shawqiyun and al najun min al nar and other qasim there is a confus of fals stori about the found of al jama ah al islamiyah and it evolut i am talk about al jama ah and privat affair i have seen of which i wa person awar not in a secondhand fashion al jama ah al islamiyah s activ start in egyptian univers in the mid 1970s in 1978 the idea came along to creat a militari organ for the jama ah the organ had a consult council found at that time it wa head by karam zahdi and among it member were tal at fu ad qasim muhammad abd al salam isam darbalah and other then abbud al zumur join and the event of 1981 occur the state secur agenc chose the name al jihad for al jama ah al islamiyah s militari organ thei want to lump us in with some other group which had no role either in spread the faith or in militari action we were join by a small group like that of ayman al zuwahiri and we met them in prison basic thei were not member of al jama ah al islamiyah thei got out and form their own organ which had no relat to us and wa not an offshoot of our abbud al zumur salah al din but abbud al zumur split awai from al jama ah al islamiyah in the mid 1980s and with him a group of member who reject abd al rahman s leadership of the organ al zumur is suppos to have said no leadership for the blind qasim as i have said for long year there ha been no split awai from al jama ah as to the case of our brother abbud there were circumst he came back into al jama ah nine month ago and is now a member of the consult council salah al din how could you accept hi return to the consult council know that he is dr umar abd al rahman s chief rival qasim it is not a question of rivalri al zumur held high offic befor go into prison the truth of what transpir is that there wa a discuss on the question of the leadership of the blind and it went on for a time al zumur said that he want a religi edict decid the issu then he obei the consult council s decis and came back into al jama ah dr abd al rahman agre to be command of al jama ah onli after he wa persuad and after intens pressur he did not want the job i repeat that abbud al zumur came back to al jama ah al islamiyah as if noth had happen salah al din why did shawqi al shaykh and hi group split off from al jama ah and form an organ call al shawqiyun that ha remain activ even after al shaykh s murder qasim thi shawqi al shaykh wa never a member of al jama ah al islamiyah he and hi group were arrest dure the polic s campaign in al fayyum against al jama ah al islamiyah neither he nor ani of those with him were member but thei were tortur in prison and thei becam inclin to the charg of unbelief we in al jama ah have a polici on the charg of unbelief and we undertook to prepar religi research on thi subject in ani case the exist of these small group that appear now and then is the result of the govern s practic and the restrict of the clergi to issu religi edict that serv to support the statu quo even when shaykh al ghazali spoke the truth in hi testimoni in the case of faraj fudah assassin secularist there were viciou secularist attack on him salah al din what do you think of al shawqiyun s arm attack on the gold shop and seizur of non muslim monei qasim we do not approv of thi issu from the point of view of legitimaci it is an extrem complic issu which ha detail precept becaus islam is against steal kill and treacheri except in time of war thu we do not approv of the seizur of the monei of ani person in thi wai without the precept set out by the clergi salah al din but the deed that you ar commit also hurt innoc peopl qasim when we carri out our oper we ar care not to hit ani member of the gener public the oper ar aim at the target person the proof is that we carri out the assassin attempt on former interior minist zaki badr in a desert area far from popul area so that no innoc person would be injur in ani case if someon happen to be in a place where on of our oper is carri out and he is hurt we feel sorri for him i affirm that none of our oper ha ever hurt anyon the bomb were attribut to al jama ah al islamiyah for exampl but the truth is that we did not do them when member of al jama ah carri out an oper we announc it we did not sai thi out of fear or to dodg blame or to seek prais salah al din but you kill a british woman tourist and wound other in your oper strike at tourism in egypt qasim we have an opinion of the tourism issu the govern s economi depend on the tourism sector and so strike at tourism mean strike the economi and thu strike at the regim itself the intent is not to kill tourist themselv we ar against tourist becaus the monei thei pour into the govern treasuri everi year mean that the regim which accord to our belief should be elimin remain in power the reviv of tourism in egypt put obstacl in the wai of our establish an islam state in egypt salah al din who issu the religi edict to kill qasim thi is a matter of legisl vote in al jama ah al islamiyah salah al din who ar it member qasim i am not in a posit to mention name but i mai sai that thei have reach the academ level of independ reason as defin by scholar of islam jurisprud we have in al jama ah al islamiyah a fairli good number of such scholar more than dozen salah al din wa an edict issu for the kill of major gener ghabarah is there an edict to kill all policemen qasim we draw a distinct between kill and combat in the case of a kill there must be a specif edict against a killer or someon who ha taken part in the kill of on of our brother or repres part of the organ in the case of combat that usual take place dure an all out confront as happen in dayrut young men there ar consid to be in a combat situat with the polic and all their repres becaus thei attack these youth and their famili thei consid all of them enemi if you take a pigeon and want to kill it you will see it beat it wing and you don t blame the pigeon for do that what of a muslim man see these practic when he consid that ani secur forc that take part in these practic ar bent on combat salah al din who ar those on the assassin list that you have prepar qasim thi busi of list is just a form of provoc us against al jama ah al islamiyah it is us by secularist writer and some govern newspap some provoc is accomplish but i consid it laughabl it is said that we put peopl on assassin list becaus thei listen to shaykh abd al basit abd al samad read the koran can anyon believ that there ar some who sai that we want to kill some artist our caus and our chief enemi ar the rule govern and the group that cooper with them salah al din who is that group qasim anyon who support or sustain the foundat of the regim for exampl who support the regim the state secur agenc of cours who is it tool the polic i am amaz at peopl who valu themslv so highli and claim that thei ar target thi is not their time our confront now is with the regim salah al din what ar your relat with the copt qasim we have a studi on thi topic publish in sever instal in the magazin al murabitun these christian will never find justic anywher but in an islam state i believ that egypt s secur servic is try to prove that member of al jama ah al islamiyah ar attack christian there ar also some christian individu who engag in danger practic purpos stir up troubl in order to provok state secur into strike at islamist is some area thu achiev their aim these practic ar not in the interest of the christian i affirm that muslim will never deal with them or rule over them except on the basi of justic justic is a duti for us even toward those who have oppress us salah al din but you kill 13 christian in on dai in dayrut last year qasim dayrut is a special commun christian have live there for a veri long time no christian ha ever been a mayor in egypt except in dayrut even so there ha never been ani troubl befor the new thing is that on of the caus i mention did occur there were practic that push the muslim mass to defend themselv so i do not attribut all the incid at dayrut to al jama ah al islamiyah most of the incid that took place against christian in dayrut and elsewher were natur reaction to practic that could have happen anywher salah al din about six month ago the subject of reconcili between the egyptian govern and member of religi group wa brought up but it end with the dismiss of the interior minist major gener muhammad abd al halim musa what is your posit now on dialogu and reconcili qasim the reconcili between the govern and al jama ah al islamiyah wa in our view someth cook up by peopl with vest interest our point of view which we announc in a communiqu confirm our reject of reconcili salah al din but on of al jama ah s promin member safwat abd al ghani made statement in on of the session of hi trial to the effect that al jama ah wa prepar to stop the violenc on certain condit wa he express a person point of view or al jama ah s posit qasim al jama ah s point of view is the on that we announc in our communiqu we sai ha the polici of execut militari trial and arrest impos secur is there ani offici who feel safe in hi hous or at work or at plai we have on demand our basic demand is the establish of an islam state if thei releas all the detaine and gave everi on of us a job and lot of monei to abandon thi cours not on in a million would accept it the confront would go on with violenc and combat salah al din do the statement of safwat abd al ghani reflect a conflict insid al jama ah over the issu of reconcili qasim al jama ah ha on specif posit perhap the prison condit some of them ar endur safwat abd al ghani among them have move them to sai someth to mitig them salah al din the al jihad organ ha claim respons for the assassin attempt on interior minist hasan al alfi observ sai that the organ us a method resembl that of al jama ah al islamiyah is al jihad now compet with al jama ah after year of absenc qasim there is no such thing as the al jihad organ thi wa a name given by the state secur agenc salah al din but there is an organ issu communiqu and carri out violent oper bear the name al jihad qasim i have mention that some of those who went out from the event of 1981 and got acquitt or short prison sentenc and never had ani role in spread the faith or militari action were tortur in prison after thei got out thei went to pakistan and afghanistan some of them call themselv the al jihad group then the al jihad societi ayman al zuwahiri wa on of them salah al din how do you plan for al jama ah al islamiyah member in pakistan and afghanistan especi as there ar egyptian effort to extradit them the al jihad organ said that it member would gather in an arab capit will you follow their exampl qasim the secur apparatu in egypt ha made a great deal of troubl for our brother in al minya and asyut forc them to move to cairo and alexandria there wa a time when our activ wa confin to the governor of al minya and asyut but thei made troubl for the youth who went to cairo and alexandria to spread the faith and mani join them after that thei made it hard for them in all the governor and thei were compel to leav the countri thei went to afghanistan and pakistan and there thei found that almighti god had a place for them now thei ar make it hard for them so thei ar look to go to other countri i can promis that the egyptian govern will suffer terribl from them it will want them back in al minya and asyut it will wish it had let them stai in the countri salah al din accord to some analys the mount act of violenc in upper egypt ar due to econom and social condit and that the random and poor area in cairo and the rest of egypt s governor produc the extremist qasim that is shallow analysi an attempt to escap from realiti and the real confront is it a question of social and econom problem i tell you we have brother in al jama ah al islamiyah who have million if it were a question of reveng in upper egypt then i point out to you our brother who ar from the lower egyptian governor salah al din you have claim respons for mahjub s assassin and the al jama ah member accus in the case were acquit did the accus carri out the oper qasim ye al jama ah claim respons and i believ that the failur of the polic and state secur to prepar investig and a case wa a reason for the innoc verdict thei reli on the method thei ar us to us with al jama ah member when thei interrog them to twist confess out of them by tortur it is onli natur that anyon who is tortur mai speak the truth or exagger or sai thing which ar untru to escap what is happen to him thu the judg found gap in the case and hand down the innoc verdict salah al din you ar oppos to the suprem state secur court and the militari court even though the suprem state secur court hand down innoc verdict in the mahjub case qasim my respons to that is to mention what happen to me person when i wa in denmark and found my name among those accus in the returne from afghanistan case befor the militari court a death sentenc wa issu against me the brother who wa execut after hi convict in the case of sharif ahmad hasan god know he had never done anyth that call for that sentenc salah al din what will be al jama ah al islamiyah s reaction should the accus in the mahjub case be tri again qasim their retrial or failur to return them would to us be a doubl disgrac we know that our brother who were found innoc will be trap when thei confront the militari court and mai be sentenc to death salah al din do you have link with the muslim brotherhood in egypt what is your view of their activ qasim the brotherhood ar our brother and thei have their direct and their wai of oper we know thei have certain interest thei want to protect thei believ that their interest ar worthwhil we do not think so at ani rate such is their view for which god will judg them we believ that the regim s confront of islamist is in phase the earli phase is al jama ah al islamiyah and then the brotherhood s time will come thei did not leav them these seat in some of the syndic for noth salah al din how ar al jama ah al islamiyah s activ fund you ar accus of get monei from certain countri such as iran qasim i affirm that we have no connect with ani countri in the world even if the egyptian govern could prove even on percent of thi talk it would have us it as proof we do not accept contact with countri or aid from them realiti tell us that these countri onli give for some goal of their own those who give pai peopl whose support thei seek or whom thei wish to us for some aim of their own the donor want to take part in decisionmak we reject thi salah al din so where do you get the arm and monei for al jama ah s activ qasim these matter ar not open to discuss we accept aid from no on iran salah al din how ar your relat with iran qasim the iranian ar shiit our differ with them is theolog what the clergi call contradict salah al din what is your comment on the report of human right group that strongli critic the behavior of member of the religi group qasim if thei ar look at reaction that is unjust thei should reveal what is actual happen then look at the reaction but not us the same standard i assert that what is happen among us ar reaction not action

an attempt even an individu on to creat sectarian sedit shanudah the term sectarian sedit wa invent by the late presid anwar al sadat we had never known thi term befor al sadat these peopl want to disrupt public order in gener and if thi can be achiev by attack on foreign tourist oper against polic bomb against bank or attack on copt then it is fine even train ar now be attack the aim is to

that he would answer ani question so i brought up hi public defenc of the alleg assassin of dr foudah we find it veri hard to understand i said how a scholarli and cultiv person could be seen to be incit ignor peopl to take the law into their own hand al ghazali deni he had incit anyon to kill inde he had declar in court that if everyon did that there would be chao but in decrib what had happen in court he made hi attitud toward apost veri clear i wa not in court to issu fatwa he said but as a wit faraj foudah had deni the rule of islam to me person in open debat at the cairo book fair two year ago now a man is free to believ that if he want to he can go and sit at home and sai it but thi man went out into the street and work against the rule of islam thi is unaccept becaus it strengthen zionism and coloni and i am against anyth that strengthen these the prophet muhammad in hi struggl with pagan said to hi companion ani on of you who want to can go and join them but do not

peopl to overthrow the govern wa thi an eventu which he felt might arriv in the near futur al ghazali laugh and said why overthrow a govern when you can organis elect and do it through the ballot box but were there free elect in egypt you should be ask that question of the peopl who rig the ballot box such an open accus of polit corrupt would have result in instant arrest for a more modest citizen and subject to the tortur which a un report for 1993 found ha now becom systemat for polit suspect in egypt al ghazali is technic an employe of the govern in hi role of member of the influenti islam

lose it econom associ with the west the muslim world is in a state of militari weak and both econom and trade weak therefor the question of whether there will be econom assist or not is a wai of maintain that fear of the west but there were element of european cultur that thei could accept he said there is the scientif element we support scientif progress and ar will partner in thi but there ar philosoph standpoint which ar unaccept to us such as atheism and commun the third element is to do with stimul desir which we consid to be social damag and which we wish to contain i point out the
