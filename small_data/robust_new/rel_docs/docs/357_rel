we have alreadi phase out our new polici on the part of the philippin is that we must enhanc our cooper in the defens field by wai of high level exchang among our offici and offic in the defens depart of the arm forc of the philippin we cooper also veri comprehens in regard to the train and school of our offic at variou level and we exchang inform of mutual benefit among the countri in thi region on a region as well as a bilater basi we feel howev on the part of the philippin that more than militari allianc the secur and therefor the stabil of our part of the world will come more from econom interdepend from mutual support in our econom endeavor and at the bottom line it will be our sustain progress that will ensur for the nation in thi region a greater degre of stabil and secur mahathir what i would like to add is the promot of asean asean wa form becaus we ar a group or part of each other and if it is your time to discuss thi problem well the likelihood is that you would confront each other but while we have asean let s sit down and talk and discuss the problem includ secur problem passag omit i am honestli sai that secur problem can be resolv by not resort to harm and have power navi and armi in the region to protect us we didn t see who is go to be our enemi on of the thing we believ in is if you sai such and such countri is go to be your enemi in the futur then thei will be your enemi now and that is where it will put us at a loss so we would rather sai that thei ar our friend and when you look around us we see friend so we won t be immers to worri about secur that much it is the other peopl out there who s think of harp on the question of secur impli that there is arm struggl forth around here thi is on thing to conquer us that is out of discont becaus countri don t conquer anymor but thi is overt dream to conquer the other thing is that on of the reason for the feel of insecur is the fact that thei have noth els to think of for exampl if a countri is veri poor then it mai think of invad anoth countri in order to get the wealth of anoth countri but if countri have prosper thei have invest into it to see that there is stabil in the region so that thei continu with their econom expans as well as trade and we believ that if the whole of thi region can becom prosper then we would all have invest into it to maintain stabil and peac without resort to war just the fact that we need stabil in order to trade would make us veri much awar of the need to avoid conflict and i think thi is happen in southeast asia and in east asia passag omit our experi with the japanes is that thei invest in malaysia and their invest ha enabl malaysia to prosper and becaus we ar more prosper now we ar bui a lot of japanes good so the japanes ar get the return of their invest more than just the profit from their invest but then if we ar not stabl then thei won t get return for their invest so when we invest in other countri we hope that their countri will becom prosper and becaus thei ar prosper thei will have vest interest and see to it that there is no war no conflict that peac is maintain and becaus there is what is good for them so i don t think we need to resort to invit the navi and armi from other part of the world to come and defend us and we feel that sometim if it is not in their interest thei don t defend you abanot just a point of clarif from the presid and the prime minist it s been over a year that you got the manila declar regard the resolut of the spratli issu ar all the countri involv now make a timet in resolv thi onc and for all ramo passag omit in our bilater meet todai we reaffirm our commit the philippin and malaysia to that polici of a peac approach to the solut of ani disput in the south china sea and on of the major step taken which i consid to be a step forward is to get our fisheri technic peopl to continu meet becaus we have alreadi start meet so that we can work out some sort of a fisheri agreement between malaysia and the philippin and our fishermen can jointli fish in the area for the benefit of both countri to further extend the idea of cooper in fish activ malaysia and the philippin will look for other possibl area for fish and food process cooper outsid of the spratli island area thi kind of approach in fact is what will be us for other area in which there ar border problem and it will also

in the poll some 57 5 percent of them do not think that a war between the two neighbor countri could break out but as mani as 31 8 percent fear that it might yet happen howev while answer the second question a major of respond though not an absolut major that is 48 percent believ in slovenia s victori while onli 13 percent believ the opposit obvious given the choic between realism and patriot the major of sloven chose the latter although it seem that in slovenia at least offici just as in croatia somewhat earlier there now prevail the phase of a return to realiti to be more precis in slovenia on notic a strang discrep between the offici polici of the coalit govern which is endeavor to be object realist and moder and the sloven media which with the assist of some right wing opposit politician ar maintain the high temperatur with a sort of anti croatian campaign full of exagger and fabric therefor on ha to keep in mind that mladina conduct the poll with thi campaign in full swing it climax seem to be the recent announc result of anoth public opinion poll in which the sloven respond said for the first time that the croat were their greatest enemi and that a major disast threaten them from the croat rather than the serb such statement ar veri well supplement by the threat deliv by zmago jelinc the leader of a nationalist parti not onli at ralli and through the media

upon the sloven victori in the war that will be start by the croat sinc as jelinc definit know a group of expert in the croatian armi is plan an attack on slovenia it is true that the nationalist mad sometim know no limit but it is also certain that the insan campaign carri out by some sloven media as well as the perform of some politician do not reflect the real disposit of public opinion and particularli the offici polici on croatia nevertheless the fact is croato sloven relat have been through mani turbul phase of rise and fall in short in two and half year first in the period up to 25 juli 1991 when both croatia and slovenia declar themselv sovereign and independ state after which thei recogn each other as such and then after that histor date those relat evolv from the initi high temperatur euphoria and romant phase when their close futur wa seen as joint through sudden estrang and open disput up to a near freez point verg on animos so those relat instead of be friendli and neighborli ar now rather encumb with mistrust and disput at the begin of the wai into independ in the struggl to crush yugoslavia to and self liber and later also in the first dai of independ croatia

these two form the border between these neighbor countri howev the crew fell apart and two rower took separ wai such an outcom wa larg influenc by the yugoslav that is the serbian aggress at first

in croatia becaus of the consequ of the war unfortun slovenia fail to show enough understand patienc and solidar with these problem while croatia perhap unjustifi expect too much from it neighbor so that in the cours of 1992 croato sloven relat dramat cool and deterior thi last year 1993 in which variou negoti on differ level were held is also over but still it did not bring about ani more

if a shipment of humanitarian aid is be made across the countri s territori it should be given the green light at custom and on transport it would seem that it is imposs to act in a more human manner

committe and parliamentari hear were held concern it but the matter never got to the point of ratif there were a rather larg number of object here ar a few of them accord to the agreement the center is an intern organ with the particip both of russian specialist and of repres of the western countri but the western have the veto right no monei will be expend without their consent that mean that the center choos certain of our individu nuclear specialist with their project and make the proviso that either the fund ar alloc onli to them or to no on take into consider our impoverish situat there can scarc be ani doubt as to whether it will be possibl to refus for a long period of time but in thi instanc there aris the follow danger it is clear that in a larg collect the role of it variou scientist differ veri much there ar alwai clear head and frequent thei ar not among the manageri staff and those clear head gener an ideolog of investig all you have to do is to pull them out and a collect of mani thousand peopl will not be abl to creat anyth benefici for a long time thereaft the veto right ha obvious creat thi danger there were also object concern the fact that russia ha freed both the center itself and the repres of the western countri from ani respons for ani undesir consequ from their activ on our territori for which inde ratif wa requir meanwhil it is gener known that the compens for the damag incur by an individu in the west reach million of dollar so there is immedi discuss about nuclear technolog and about chelyabinsk 70 and arzama 16 consequ there is no

continu to remain open here too there ar sever curiou but littl known detail for exampl unlik us the lead western countri take a somewhat differ approach to the problem of intern secur there littl is said about collect secur but instead wide us is made of variou modif of forc model of maintain intern secur which assum as the basic goal the guarante of an order rest upon a balanc of forc which should not be confus with pariti or equal of forc upon the divis of sphere of influenc and upon the concept of local war as a method of elimin that balanc proceed from that concept thei figur out variou altern for behavior if the region balanc ha been violat or an arm conflict ha arisen then it is stop specif by mean of the restor of the balanc a clear exampl of thi is the conflict in former yugoslavia where the serb obvious ar enjoi the militari advantag if it prove possibl to shift the global balanc of forc to their advantag then the attempt will be made to implement it by demand econom or polit concess and it is import here that in order to make a decis it is first necessari to comput the entir chain of the possibl escal of the conflict if the comput indic that it will be possibl to achiev victori at the kei stage then the politician begin boldli to demand concess if the other side prove to be slow wit or uncompromis then the west in respons frequent proce along the chain build up the conflict thei begin drop bomb on tripoli or baghdad and the peopl there see that thei ar lose quickli yield it is possibl to argu about the detail of thi scheme but on the whole thi is exactli what kind of scheme it is howev if thi is so and the quantiti and qualiti of weapon is necessari not onli to be victori in war but also in polit and in econom then there aris the question of how the start ii treati fit into thi scheme becaus it is clear that in the format of the balanc of forc a particip factor is not onli nuclear weapon but also super accur weapon the latest stealth materi and the qualiti of troop manag it is no secret that the unit state and nato as a whole ar strong specif with regard to these compon and all of them remain outsid the confin of the start ii treati moreov accord to the treati the unit state retain it main strike forc the navi while we reduc our most combat readi mean surfac missil so do we ourselv by violat the balanc of militari forc want to provok the west to an econom polit or territori repartit expert have also express the follow fear as is gener known the sdi in russian soi program prove to be insolv and incap of guarante the secur of the unit state in the event of the launch of thousand of missil by an enemi howev if the start ii treati is implement comput on evm electron comput indic that with the aid of super accur weapon and the us of other similar equip it will be possibl to prevent the launch of onli approxim 200 russian missil but it is alreadi possibl to intercept that number with the aid of sdi is it necessari for us in thi instanc by our own hand to resurrect that program in gener question with respect to that treati have arisen it is natur that the foreign affair committe in thi situat request the mid ministri of foreign affair and minoboroni ministri of defens to send the committe the american and nato concept of the balanc of forc the mainten of intern order and the make of foreign polici decis so that within their context it could decid the fate of the treati in half a year no repli at all have been receiv but unoffici it wa said you have the text of the treati so go studi it of cours most of the necessari american document and conceptu studi were on the bookshelf at the foreign affair committe it wa howev necessari to receiv an offici answer in order later to ask subsequ question it can be assum howev that no repli wa given to the committe not so much becaus there wa a strong desir to protect the treati as becaus there wa no complet understand of exactli what those rather poor deputi want from them in ani case on is led to thi conclus by the militari doctrin that wa recent adopt by the russian secur council there noth wa state serious about the need to us forc model although it is clear that as a result of that mention there would be a rather consider increas in the polit role of arm forc it is also necessari to talk about the unratifi open ski treati the essenc of that treati is in exchang for good monei the western countri have the right approxim onc everi ten dai to fly across russia along ani flight path carri out aerial photo reconnaiss correspondingli we in exchang for payment have the same right with respect to those countri it is understood that these aerial survei ar a mean of carri out a veri detail monitor of the situat in the countri but is it necessari for us to monitor the territori of the unit state in thi wai possibl the specialist ar make a mistak but in the opinion of sever of them it is scarc possibl by thi method to prevent an attack launch by a consider stronger oppon on would also scarc think that it will be possibl to obtain ani substanti econom benefici inform sinc in an industri countri all the basic secret ar locat most probabl in the laboratori and comput but with respect to russia on can speak onli about the econom valu of variou territori natur resourc trend in foreign invest expect harvest plant of narcot and local conflict in gener to put it mildli on can notic a definit asymmetri of interest of cours russia ha not been hide anyth for a long time so on could think a bit about at least earn monei on these flight there is howev no guarante that our militari men will not demand the earn monei to pai for the same kind of flight over the unit state which ar essenti speak complet useless and thei mai even ask for more monei the convent on the destruct of chemic weapon is also on the approach to consider in the vs suprem soviet as is gener known american chemic ammunit is most frequent thin wall and our convers is thick wall which our militari men alwai consid to be a shortcom but with the american the servic life date is shorter becaus of the thin wall our on the other hand can be stockpil for mani addit year and can be gradual destroi or reprocess for advantag us by ourselv the american howev did not forget the concept of the balanc of forc and quickli organ the sign of that convent natur russian diplomat did not fail to place their signatur wherev necessari without have true unlik our transatlant colleagu either the fund to destroi the chemic weapon or a correspond state program an agreement with

a result certain measur were plan and it would seem the principl of satiat wolv and intact sheep wa observ but an oral understand is on thing and the text of a treati is anoth current on can onli guess about how thi question will be resolv it should be note that accord to the new constitut author for the us of troop abroad will be given onli by the feder council half of which consist of person belong to the execut branch of power so there is someth to think about here it is also worthwhil to discuss the draft of the law govern the procedur for the conclus and denounc of intern treati thi draft which on the whole is a benefici and necessari document made it wai in the suprem soviet to the second read but it did not manag to get through it what remain a fundament problem that wa not

open question that cannot be agre on the level of mix commiss that is it diplomat part rajic is it true that at the press confer held dure the break of the bled meet on could see differ with regard to principl on which the two side intend to work in establish their joint border the croatian side advoc a mix principl of variou criteria for establish the border while the sloven side insist on the

prime minist valent and drnovsek though made at the declar level contain the principl in question all thi show that the two side ar gradual get closer the impress of the press on the other hand advoc the absolut of just on principl and becom a slave to it which i am convinc would never produc a good or final result for our task is not onli to establish the fact but also to predict the consequ should ani of the principl be appli to everi singl open question therefor give the principl a special statu is out of the question for we must still establish the fact whose content will reconcil the

the entir border problem between croatia and slovenia kacic the bai of piran is undoubtedli on of the main point of these negoti it is also true that thi is the main bone of content in the present work regard border howev in order to solv that question we must finish the work on the land border and sai where it come out at which point to the bai of piran i think we should proce as follow we must first solv the question of who control the bai of piran it is not an ambit of croatia to chang the name of the bai but the name itself sai that is an area in which the sloven interest is more intens present moreov i do not believ that in addit to croatian maritim resourc in for exampl limski kanal croatia ha ani interest for the shell in the bai of piran itself howev on advantag of the sloven negoti team ha hitherto escap our notic slovenia border four countri itali austria hungari and croatia it doe not have ani border disput with the first three countri so it seem that it ha a problem onli with the bad gui from croatia for border conflict exist there croatia on the other hand ha no border conflict onli with hungari with regard to all other border from slovenia to serbia from bosnia to montenegro croatia will have to put much effort into solv all the problem and settl the border disput furthermor on must have some understand for the sloven side which us to have the

that would not make our sloven neighbor claustrophob i do not think that is in the interest of croatia either but the sovereignti of croatia on it territori must not be jeopard rajic in that context

want to keep the door open for reconcili if thi law is pass there is no hope of reconcili if such a law is promulg there will be fight and kill until cambodia drop dead therefor i would like to appeal to the khmer roug to think hard and stop paint everyth as vietnames you should be awar that the fight is take place between khmer do not us the vietnames as an excus to block out peac present the khmer roug ar gain thei ar win battl thi mean that if thei keep fight thei will win more thi is becaus the govern armi is finish becaus too mani of it troop ar demor the offic seem to be all right but the rank and file ha no incent thei ar lowli paid and some month thei receiv no pai at all in the battl thei see that thei ar fight onli fellow khmer and not soldier of ani aggress nation moreov thei know thei ar get noth out of the war thei experi onli miseri and death even in death thei do not know for whom thei die ar thei dy for the nation most of them do not believ that thei ar dy for the nation in the current war so the soldier who shoulder the brunt of the fight ar demor there is no wai to win a battl with demor soldier the khmer roug know that the soldier on thi side have a low moral thei take the advantag by launch heavier attack and forc the govern troop to pull back when retreat becom debacl thei will captur battambang town poipet sisophon samraong chongkal tbeng meanchei and so on and on dai thei will be abl to seiz angkor wat and angkor thom as thei did in 1976 thei will push ahead and seiz pursat and kompong thom so thei see that thei ar gain ground of cours thei dare not sai no to the king s new plan becaus the king is the onli on who still befriend them who els is on good term with the khmer roug no on on thi side so fear total isol thei do not sai no in the

independ and territori integr and keep our countri aliv not onli for just a dozen more year but for gener to come so that our great grandchildren can live on cambodian soil as in the time of sangkum rea niyum moreov i would like to tell you frankli vener monk that no on is pai much attent to sihanouk now it appear that these warrior seem not to be listen to even the vener monk to whom will thei listen then thi is why i have beg the two vener suprem patriarch samdech preah pouthiveang and samdech preah mongkol proettheacha to help me yesterdai i listen to the veri nice and enlighten sermon by samdech preah mongkol proettheacha pleas help make appeal over the radio and on televis urg the conscienc of khieu samphan and the pdk to agre to the roundtabl if the khmer roug doe not want to come to phnom penh then convinc them to go to the palac in north korea make them hurri the longer the delai the wors it will for all of us vener monk pleas help me word indistinct there is also the unit nation to turn to howev it might not agre to come and help us becaus it ha help us onc alreadi at great expens and with minim success the khmer roug doe not listen to them if i call on the unit nation to come and help us mayb thei will not come anywai i will try write to un secretari gener butru butru ghali ask the unit nation to consid send a un forc to help bring about reconcili mayb thei will not come becaus thei ar face with so mani other seriou crise in the world such as bosnia herzegovinia and other hot spot where fight is even more seriou than in our countri the unit nation is busi with these problem and mayb it doe not have enough monei and manpow to help us nonetheless after attend thi meet i will prepar a letter to the unit nation ask it to consid beef up it presenc here present there ar 30 un troop in cambodia but thei ar near the end of their mission the other dai thei came and bid me farewel if we have more un troop not for fight but for reconcili it would be good howev the khmer roug who did not listen to them befor sure will not listen to them now if thei come back so we come to the conclus that the khmer roug listen to neither sihanouk nor samdech preah khousananda leader of the peac march now we ar left with onli the two suprem patriarch samdech preah mongkol proettheacha samdech preah pouthiveang and samdech preah khousana five top monk to try to persuad them through variou media howev if the khmer roug doe not listen to you then we will be in a difficult situat thei sai thei believ in the king but thei do not listen to him on thi side too to be frank thei did not listen to me befor it is onli after thei suffer defeat under heavi khmer roug blow that thei seem to be pai ani attent to me howev thi kind of attitud is not right when thei win thei do not listen to me it is onli when thei lose that thei listen with thi attitud we cannot solv problem win or lose you should listen to me onli with thi attitud can we solv problem no i am not be acrimoni against or angri at the children on the phnom penh side but to be frank vener monk the children on the phnom penh side also do not listen to me thei claim to be reverenti to me but thei do not listen to me thei were so boast when thei won some battl now that thei ar lose thei sai thei vener the king and would follow all hi instruct thi is seriou both side have seriou flaw neither is praiseworthi therefor i ask both side to think it over forget about who win or lose for in both case it is cambodia it is the peopl who ar the loser how can we sai that the peopl ar the loser it is becaus thei ar the on who suffer miseri devast and separ the peopl make up 99 percent of the popul and how mani of you ar there on both side it is not fair for just a few person to plung the whole nation into miseri it is time for both side to think hard about that for exampl thi side said yesterdai that thei were win battl again i do not know whether their claim is true i am afraid if thei ar realli win thei will becom boast again and stop listen to the king my advic to them is do not indulg in such a game win or lose just ignor it the onli thing that you should keep in mind is thi what can we do to avoid cambodia becom extinct in the next 10 20 year you must have piti for the peopl for the vener monk and for the 99 percent of the popul that is suffer becaus of you so i demand that the bigshot on both side stop behav that wai applaus vener monk i am not angri but i have to shout a bit loudli to make myself heard in case thei ar deaf laughter no i am not angri vener monk thei ar all my children how can i be angri at them howev i need to make them hear me when thei no longer enjoi the fanfar of victori thei sai thei hear me when thei do not want to hear me thei claim to be

measur econom sanction natur bring disadvantag the dprk is race ahead with it nuclear armament in spite of critic from the intern commun unit nation sanction on that countri ar set to be gradual strengthen onc sanction ar appli natur japan will be ask to follow suit furthermor it is more like than not that japan will be ask to plai a central role in sanction activ becaus the dprk the target of the sanction is a neighbor countri and ha an import effect on japan s secur the govern ha made it polici clear that it will do it utmost within the framework of the constitut whenev the matter of sanction is rais howev what matter is legal limit in the post cold war intern commun increas in variou sanction includ those by the unit nation is expect not except the recent dprk case therefor it is most urgent to examin how much japan can do under the present law and what kind of legal prepar ar necessari to fulfil intern oblig in the intern commun dure the cold war the two super power the unit state and the soviet union plai the role of world polic other countri had no need to particip even if thei were ask to go in tune with militari sanction and could manag just by make gestur of go along with it when nonmilitari sanction were appli in the post cold war intern commun howev it becam inevit to maintain order by cooper among lead nation thu un initi sanction activ ar on the increas and japan a lead nation cannot avoid take part in such activ dure cold war dai japan particip in nonmilitari sanction activ on mani occas a typic exampl wa an econom sanction against southern rhodesia follow a un resolut when the soviet union invad afghanistan japan wa ask to particip in the us initi econom sanction but took onli a cooper pose against the dprk japan follow suit in nonmilitari sanction follow the 1983 rangoon bomb assassin attempt against the rok presid and the 1987 korean air bomb incid fresh in our memori is japan s follow suit in the post cold war sanction against iraqi aggress of kuwait in japan it ha been emphas that intern disput should not be settl by militari mean but when it wa ask to particip in econom sanction a power nonmilitari measur cautiou view were domin at all time in that effect of sanction ar dubiou becaus damag to be suffer by japan is larger than that afflict on the subject countri in an intern societi that ha a diversifi sens of valu econom sanction in mani case end up incomplet enforc effect embargo measur as intend thi tendenc will be acceler due to the multipolar of intern societi follow the cold war s end in that sens the aforement view seem to be right howev that view is base on a misunderstand about econom sanction econom sanction ar polit act despit the modifi econom found in the term econom activ ar meaningless if thei end up in red figur on the other hand expens ar requir if polit activ ar to achiev desir object so the minu figur earn by sanction ar expens as a matter of fact econom sanction forc the subject countri to make sacrific and chang it polici and at the same time thei underlin the intent of protest that the counterpart activ will not be toler at the cost of damag on the part of the protest countri in the latter s case the larger the minu figur on the part of sanction enforc countri the stronger the intent of the protest with thi in mind let me examin how far japan can particip in variou sanction act under the exist law these sanction mai be classifi into three categori nonmilitari semimilitari and militari the nonmilitari sanction will restrict the subject countri s flow of men good and monei japan ha particip in thi kind of sanction in the sanction against the dprk in connect with the rangoon assassin attempt and the korean airlin bomb incid movement of men wa restrict accord to exist law and ordin as follow 1 restrict of contact among diplomat 2 ban in principl nation public servic personnel from make trip to the dprk 3 ban in principl the entri to japan of public servic personnel and more strict entri examin of privat citizen from the dprk 4 ban special aircraft from fly into japanes airport and so on if the dprk adamantli continu to refus the iaea from inspect nuclear facil the un secur council will most like defin the dprk act as a threat to peac as defin in articl 39 of the un charter and adopt a resolut to impos econom sanction in accord with articl 41 of the charter thei includ such measur as restrict or stop trade and remitt and further freez dprk oversea asset in the begin thei will be moder but thei will gradual becom stricter with ey on the dprk respons whatev shape econom sanction take and japan is ask to follow such a preced as the sanction against iraq will make it possibl for japan to fulli respond with the exist law and ordin in restrict and or stop trade the intern trade and industri minist can restrict or stop it in accord with the provis of articl 25 of the foreign exchang and foreign trade control act sai that if it is deem to interfer with the mainten of the intern peac and secur in impos sanction on the dprk the most effect and decis measur is said to be stop remitt from japan of monei estim at 60 billion yen a year as well as an oil embargo thi kind of stoppag of remitt of variou kind of monei can be handl by amend to the financ minist s notic and there is no need for amend to law as a mean of send monei quit a few travel to the dprk take cash with them thi can be dealt with by amend to the financ minist s notic and by enforc strict check at harbor and airport as a matter of fact it is extrem difficult to legal restrict or ban the remitt through or via enterpris in third countri thu there is a strong possibl that restrict or stop remitt mai becom ineffect but it is signific in stress the intent of protest that japan will not toler the dprk nuclear armament semimilitari sanction logist support and sea blockad what matter next is legal problem aris from japan s cooper with semimilitari sanction for thi examin the problem at five level becom necessari the first is relat to particip and cooper with un peac keep activ in thi connect a prerog interpret ha been made to the effect that

to be dispatch to the korean peninsula the second problem is particip and or cooper with activ mention befor by multin forc which in the futur becom the central part of peac enforc activ when the multin forc with the unit state as the core becom involv in militari sanction against the dprk japan will face the issu legal problem pertain to share the cost have alreadi been clear dure the gulf war dai multin forc ar expect to take action under the author given by the unit nation so there is littl problem under present law the particip in noncombat activ will becom possibl howev if the pko cooper law and some of it provis ar amend the third problem is relat to how to respond to logist suppli when arm conflict take place in neighbor countri includ the korean peninsula and the unit nation us militari intervent in other word there ar legal problem that will aris when japan is us as a base of sorti suppli and repair and mainten of weapon if an arm conflict occur in the korean peninsula which is in a state of ceas fire it is the resumpt of combat between un forc in korea and dprk forc reviv the alreadi exist agreement regard the statu of un forc in japan and japan will be oblig to execut support servic to eight nation includ the us the uk franc and so on to let other countri make us of japanes facil there will be a need either to amend the exist agreement regard the statu of un forc in japan or sign anoth agreement with diet consent it becom necessari to sign a new agreement on the statu of forc when arm conflict occur in neighbor countri other than the korean peninsula and the unit nation decid on arm intervent and to us japan for base the exist agreement regard the statu of the un forc wa sign under the present constitut and there ha never been ani signific interpret constru it unconstitut therefor there will be no legal problem in sign a new agreement on the statu of forc it is a polici judgment problem the fourth problem is relat to a case when the multin forc that includ us forc make arm intervent in arm conflict in japan s neighbor countri and want to us japan for base in the rear as for the unit state it can us them when both japan and the unit state in prior consult agre that it is necessari to contribut to mainten of intern peac and secur in the far east as provid in articl 6 of the treati of mutual cooper and secur between japan and the unit state if us util is constitut util by multin forc can be constitut too onli in the latter s case anoth law or agreement on the statu of forc becom necessari if japan decid to let the multin forc us japan for base meanwhil suppli materi includ oil to us warship on the high sea by japan s maritim self defens forc sdf is possibl under the sdf law as long as the condit that there ar no hindranc is met as provid in articl 29 of the commod law but for other countri it is understood there is a need to make an appar mention about it in the sdf law the fifth is legal problem in the case of particip in militari action taken to effectu econom blockad the action of blockad at issu here is not a wartim blockad as part of militari oper but a peacetim blockad in gener term therefor the us of militari forc is not indispens as in wartim blockad but as a matter of fact some naval and ground forc ar still us in parallel with the major compon naval forc in mani case to make a blockad effect in japan not a few take an econom blockad as a nonmilitari measur but in fact it should be regard as a semimilitari measur join in blockad activ is not intend as a us of arm but there mai be case of fire arm and shell as a warn to ship that refus to lie to for search becaus of thi it is fear that the act mai conflict with the govern s present prerog interpret in addit there is an interpret that constru it legal imposs sinc there ar no provis of duti on the particip in sanction activ in duti regul in either the sdf law or the maritim safeti agenc msa law the defens agenc reveal that japan s particip in sea blockad will be dealt with first by coordin with the msa patrol ship and seaplan and if thei ar found insuffici the sdf mai be call upon for support defens councilor ken sato present an opinion to the liber democrat parti section relat to nation defens that it is possibl that sdf aircraft or ship ar dispatch to the scene if it is within the territori or territori water but thi sort of interpret is so uniqu that it is applic onli in japan the msa is in charg of polic activ for maintain public peac and order and it activ ar restrict except for exercis the right of hot pursuit within the territori and exclus econom zone by intern law it is limit to arm forc that can carri out blockad on the high sea adjac to the territori water of the countri against which a blockad is impos in the blockad against haiti the us coast guard is particip with the us navi becaus the coast guard is on of the five branch of the us arm forc meanwhil japan s msa is not a part of the sdf arm forc therefor the msa govern ship do not have the author to board and search on the high sea author by intern law to naval ship of other countri and japan s maritim sdf in the sdf law ar found articl 84 cover measur against violat of territori air space and articl 82 cover guard activ at sea the japanes govern seem to interpret these two provis as polic activ but in foreign countri thei ar a part of defens activ in a stage still far from full scale militari action retir major gener hiroki miyazaki on of those who help write the sdf law said these activ ar intend for defens activ in the stage not quit up to issu sail or march order for defens therefor it is possibl to particip in peacetim blockad activ by make littl amend to the provis cover guard activ at sea militari sanction is dispatch of sdf possibl next come the problem of particip in intern sanction activ at present the govern interpret the constitut as allow onli us of arm in self defens but ban ani act beyond it like the exercis of right to collect self defens someth like dispatch self defens forc abroad for the purpos of us of arm until befor the time of the ikeda cabinet howev the exercis of right to collect self defens wa not constru unconstitut and until veri recent it wa interpret that what the constitut ban is war as a mean of settl intern disput thu leav room to permit intern sanction activ as the matter of fact for japan to particip in intern militari sanction there ar three choic the first is to delet the second section of articl 9 of the constitut end the queer interpret that onli pass in japan and make legal the interpret in accord with legal theori and common sens that can pass in the intern commun it is an internation accept theori that what the first section ban is aggress war but sanction or intern sanction activ ar out of question even without insert a provis regard right to collect self defens and accord to the scienc of law acknowledg of right includ permiss of exercis it is just like the acknowledg of freedom of speech includ permiss of the exercis of such freedom in write and speech make but thi choic ha the polit hurdl that constitut amend ar extrem difficult to make the second is to open the wai to particip in militari sanction as part of intern secur as an entir differ concept found in the report of the ozawa investig committe of the ldp the term intern secur wa creat by the ozawa committe the same report base on a tacit premis that exercis the right to collect self defens violat the constitut interpret intern secur as constitut howev thi interpret also ha a fault becaus the right to collect self defens origin from the similar legal concept of intern secur us defens report have mainli dealt with matter relat to allianc base on the right to collect self defens and it wa onli two or three year ago when thei began deal with matter relat to collect secur such as pko nato is a typic allianc base on the right to collect self defens and at the same time it bear the charact of a region organ of the collect secur system of the unit nation therefor it is hardli possibl that on is constitut while the other is not militari sanction that japan can particip in base on the theori of constitution of intern secur have not been organ so far and thei ar restrict to regular un forc which ar difficult to form therefor thei cannot be answer to the problem we face as wa learn from the somalia case it must be rememb that conflict with compar low intens can be dealt with by un peacekeep activ but that the multin forc method must be emploi in compulsorili enforc peac of high intens the third method is to alter the govern s prerog interpret in a wai to make exercis of the right of collect self defens and intern act of sanction constitut for the time be with constitut amend to that effect in later dai it is proper to sai in view of deal with the diet and the power balanc that it is return the present govern interpret which is conspicu against legal principl and intern common sens to it origin place where it belong the peopl find thi kind of interpret easier to understand than forc the wai through by a sophistri that hahei despatch troop is unconstitut while haken send them is not it must be prepar to face greater resist from bureaucrat of the cabinet legisl bureau who attach import to pile of past interpret and from defens bureaucrat who find comfort in the present interpret in addit to resist from forc insist on constitut protect and those old guard who do not want chang in the present statu regardless of reason howev the aforement three choic ar applic when arm conflict in neighbor countri includ the korean peninsula ar not extend to japan in the event of organ attack against japan vari by degre of their extens it will be possibl to take defens action by initi defens mobil in accord with the sdf law for exampl the present prerog interpret make it possibl to counterattack launch base with aircraft and so on if the dprk attack japan by missil but even in that case it is said that the present interpret doe not permit send ground troop to the korean peninsula for emerg evacu of japanes nation from countri and area engulf in arm conflict it is said that the us of sdf aircraft or ship is not unconstitut but thei cannot be us becaus of a lack of legal support although the rule and opposit parti agre to deal with the problem of us sdf aircraft in such emerg by ad amend to the sdf law the plan wa stillborn in the midst of confus of polit reform bill deliber us of militari power subject to intern law as for particip in intern sanction the passiv peopl in japan halt the thought by rais such reason as unconstitut or without legal provis grant even if thei ar unconstitut or violat law such interpret ar not a conclus for politician if it is judg necessari polit it is a begin for adjust such law as discuss abov exist law and ordin ar suffici to launch nonmilitari measur and it is appar that quit a few semimilitari measur can also be put into practic as for militari measur a certain amount can be dealt with if sophist or self contradict repli made toward opposit argument of the social democrat parti of japan and the japan communist parti were alter in their interpret on the basi of intern common sens and legal principl therefor it can be said that the govern is evad it polit judgment with the excus of unconstitution and inadequ law it doe not end there as comment mr kenichi takemura point out world common sens is absurd to japan and japan s common sens is absurd to the world a typic exampl is the interpret of and attitud toward the law regard activ of the sdf arm forc by intern law in foreign countri and pre world war ii japan there is no need for provis in domest law over the exercis of nation power in the intern commun such as militari power and it is a basic rule for thi exercis to follow intern law and practic howev everi nation ha enact law and ordin on rule of hostil in the exercis of militari power in intern societi thi is aim first to restrain such act from go beyond the framework permit by intern law or practic in consider of polit as well as moral matter and secondli it is due to the situat that the domest societi s support is indispens in take such militari action therefor it doe not mean that no action can be taken becaus no domest law or ordin mention them but it doe mean that action can be taken in accord with intern law and practic in thi connect it is necessari to clearli state in domest law the author to us militari power within on s societi includ involv in disast relief activ to provid help to peopl in need as well as to maintain public peac and order with the possibl of us arm against it own peopl in these case action should be taken in accord with domest law and ordin and arm can onli be us in case allow by domest law and ordin after world war ii why did the interpret that the sdf cannot take ani intern action due to lack of legal provis contrari to case of variou foreign countri becom an accept theori the reason ar 1 due to neglect on the part of the govern the legal interpret made at the time of the polic reserv forc for maintain public peac and order still drag on even after it develop into the sdf arm forc with nation defens as their major duti 2 from the time of the polic reserv forc polic offic have continu to keep import decisionmak author on defens administr henc contribut to interpret the defens law system in the context of the polic law 3 there ha been a strong polit tendenc to restrain sdf activ becaus there have been power polit parti that insist on the sdf unconstitution and the repent of the militari s wartim act in cold war dai japan could pass as a special nation with a queer legal interpret that can onli appli to japan in post cold war intern societi howev japan mai well lose it intern trust and endang it nation secur if it continu to act from the past forc of habit it is haughti of

decis seat in the futur militari order the italian strategist niccolo machiavelli made the famou statement that all nation with militari prophet triumph and all without fall in which case what kind of war will the chines armi face and can the chines armi win local war these ar question that we need to analyz systemat and demonstr fulli i local war that china will face as far as the chines armi wa concern 1993 wa a veri unusu year the central militari commiss which had just been reorgan held an enlarg session at the begin of the year in beij at thi meet the central militari commiss made crucial post cold war decis on matter such as the chines armi s forc build guid ideolog strateg principl and train direct after the larg million troop cutback and shift of forc build guid ideolog to a modern track in 1985 thi wa anoth crucial strateg reorgan for the chines armi at thi meet militari commiss chairman jiang zemin state clearli that we certainli will win high tech local war on contemporari term it wa decid at thi meet that the overal number of troop would not be cut back further and that the qualiti forc build prioriti would be place on adjust the establish system and develop and upgrad weaponri the confer gave crucial strateg place to intensifi educ and train to improv the armi s mobil respons capabl to cope with sudden incid tufa shijian on modern term the world s militari intellig expert well know the signific of such a seri of crucial decis made at thi time by thi militari superpow with a popul of 1 1 billion and an armi of 3 million it mai be said that befor the breakup of the soviet union the chines armi still regard the mideast falkland island and afghanistan war as a particular type of combat to be understood and studi or that it had made onli an insignific strateg adjust becaus of them but after the breakup of the soviet union sinc the gulf war in particular the chines armi now take local and region war as a real threat and a futur kei combat style to be studi and demonstr as well as have rais the natur of the matter from a campaign scale to a strateg level it mai thu be infer that thi crucial adjust had long sinc been an establish gener plan in the mind of the command that wa just wait to be call out or a carefulli consid option it show that the chines armi is make activ prepar for come local or region war consid from it deeper immedi set thi adjust ha clear aim that is in the complic and confus militari order the chines armi ha face up to it overt and potenti adversari the hotspot where local war or arm conflict might break out ar grow gradual more evid in some case even deterior steadili the overt adversari the world s top militari power the unit state while the conflict of strateg interest between china and the unit state wa overshadow for a time by the tripartit great power relationship it is now surfac steadili sinc the breakup of the soviet union as grave antagon and differ exist between china and the unit state in area such as ideolog social system and foreign polici it ha been imposs for sino us relat to essenti improv for quit some time with a dualiti begin to exist that is along with mutual cooper and advantag a state of mutual wari exist while china cannot yet pose an immedi strateg threat to the unit state the unit state ha still includ china in it region defens strategi as an anticip target of oper the unit state is now adjust it deploy in the asia pacif region in which the adjust deploy will form a fan shape strateg structur with us territori as the base of the fan and the us japan south korea allianc as the fan s kei rib it frontlin deploy will chang from south korea japan and the philippin to alaska south korea japan and guam while the us plan to cut it overal troop strength in the asia pacif region from 200 000 to 180 000 in five year as well as close 34 base and adjust 48 other as to it kei direct in northeast asia the unit state is go to keep and consolid 16 base in japan and 15 in south korea so while the adjust will reduc the us militari s overal troop strength in the asia pacif region leav it without a larg scale region combat capabl it will have a limit naval and airstrik capabl which support by strateg mobil forc on us territori will give it more than enough capabl to fight a medium scale local war after the year 2000 the asia pacif region is like to gradual becom a us strateg prioriti a concern us figur note that the evolv global econom and s t develop trend is shift the econom focu from europ to the pacif region with an accompani shift in the global polit focu east asia is go to becom the heartland of world econom and s t by the 21st centuri whoever control east asia will control the world so as to us global strategi consider the unit state absolut cannot toler the rise of a power adversari in east asia in 1992 the us militari s asia pacif gener headquart held a special forum on the implement of a new militari strategi for the asia pacif region point out that the chines armi s ever grow overal might is have a sever impact on the militari balanc in the asia pacif region the asia pacif region now ha more than 10 local conflict hotspot and mani border disput with a great possibl of touch off futur local war the us militari station in the asia pacif region in addit to remain vigil against the russian armi also regard china north korea and vietnam as kei oper target the us seventh fleet see the rapidli grow chines navi as on of the kei adversari pose a signific threat to the unit state in the region aim at the us strateg deploy and the increasingli tens situat in the south china sea china is correspondingli adjust it maritim defens and naval develop strategi substitut a sweep maritim strategi for it accustom offshor defens strategi it focu is on the mid rang maritim space beyond 200 nautic mile to ensur the secur of it 200 nautic mile of territori water so the chines navi ha been equip in recent year with a number of highli autom special craft with advanc technolog such as new ship long rang bomber and anti sub patrol boat it is predict that within five year china will have an aircraft carrier format meanwhil china s public and applic of a new gener of train law and regul repres by the new naval affair train regul ar bring it naval oper closer to an integr sea air and land combat level in 1991 451 chines naval vessel took part in long rang navig drill more than half of which were conduct in the pacif ocean chines nuclear submarin not onli have carri out 90 round the clock dai of self suffici assess long rang drill but also have complet their first out of island long rang drill so it can be visual that the chines navi will acquir a carrier format befor long to achiev it goal of a sweep maritim strategi an overal analysi of the militari antagon between china and the unit state could lead to the follow basic conclus 1 china and the unit state focus on their respect econom and polit interest in the asia pacif region will remain in a sustain state of confront 2 for quit a long period of time thi confront will be in the state of a strong us and a weak china with quit a larg gap in compar might 3 while there is litl possibl of direct warfar between the two armi there ar a great mani indirect engag factor and timespac mainli problem spot such as korea taiwan hong kong the south china sea island and tibet 4 there is littl possibl of a larg or medium size land war break out between china and the unit state with indirect clash be mainli naval and air oper 5 the factor that might set off chang in thi state of confront ar a the russian armi s stand be the on most like to impact a chang of statu b whether the asean countri might form a joint militari forc such an allianc direct against china would be even more disadvantag to china but if such an allianc doe not happen or is direct at the unit state while it could not essenti revers the state of affair it would be much more favor to china c the stand of japan and south korea while japan and south korea ar now us militari alli we cannot exclud the possibl of certain chang due to ever sharpen econom conflict even if these two countri remain neutral that would affect the achiev of us strateg object d taiwan if taiwan and mainland china could reach a foreign polici consensu on uphold our territori sovereignti the situat would be somewhat differ a comeback by a power adversari japan quit obvious the japan of todai cannot be call a militari power the internation recogn evalu criteria for a so call militari power requir four gener essenti factor

exceed defens need with the militari mean to pursu nation intent the exist and oper of militari might that can have a signific impact on on s region and even on the world militari order of these four gener essenti factor japan is not equip with at least two the second and third but in a local war japan could still be regard as a power adversari moreov as time pass it would certainli not be hard for thi nation that is veri good at do other in to replai it power bushido style and becom a militari superpow in on leap sinc the 1980 s japan ha carri out a seri of crucial adjust in it militari strategi cautious approach it object of becom a polit and militari power in 1980 japan formal set forth it comprehens secur guarante strategi openli includ for the first time militari forc develop in it nation secur strategi in 1981 it set forth for the first time it forward defens strategi hold that as soon as an enemi approach to attack it will be annihil at sea which wa a crucial shift from territori defens to oceango defens in 1987 japan went on to propos an at sea air defens show sign of an oceango triphibi defens system and in 1991 a japanes defens white paper impli that militari might is the ultim guarante of nation secur not long afterward the japanes diet forc through a bill on cooper action in un peacekeep which wa a first step in break with it postwar constitut in nation

to be note that the japanes militari ha alwai seen it air forc as a strateg strike forc to be given prioriti develop while it combat aircraft mai be few in number thei ar certainli high in qualiti for instanc it major fighter the f 15j is current the world s most advanc fighter sinc the gulf war japan ha made plan to purchas 20 kc 10 tanker as well as bui e 3a airborn warn and control aircraft super long distanc radar and patriot missil onc equip with these the japanes airforc will have the capabl to strike target thousand of km awai cover russia s far east coastal zone the korean peninsula and china s southeast coastal zone thu make the transit from a defens to a combin offens defens strategi japan s militari might can be sum up as more than enough for territori defens but still not enough for independ oversea involv restrict by a number of factor for some time to come the japanes militari will not have the independ might for extern combat but will continu to reli on a joint japanes us defens for joint combat so while there is quit obvious not much possibl in the short term of a direct militari conflict break out between china and japan incid in the south china sea island and on the korean peninsula might touch off local firefight between the two side at such a time the problem for the chines armi would be how to cope with the japanes air forc an unpredict super

spratli it would certainli be veri difficult for us to defend them but on veri clear point is that the chines armi doe not have much time to resolv the spratli problem the potenti greatest threat india in 1986 india paid a veri high price to bui on of britain s largest aircraft carrier the herm make the indian navi the onli on in asia to have two carrier thi put india on the throne as asia s first militari power thi wa the result of nearli three decad of self impos hardship by india to wipe out it nation humili of 1962 sinc the sino indian war india had shift it nation defens strategi from peac coexist to a focu on arm develop try to gain great nation statu in intern affair through steadili increas it militari might in thi nearli three decad except for a local arm conflict with pakistan in the earli 1970s as india had suffer almost no major domest troubl or foreign invas it militari strength had grown steadili sharpli rais it overal combat capabl the indian militari now ha 1 3 million troop over 700 combat plane more than 100 naval ship 3 000 plu tank and the capabl to develop and produc medium rang guid missil and nuclear missil quantit while the indian militari is not yet up to the size of the chines armi it ha certainli outdon us qualit particularli have clearli surpass china in area such as naval and air forc equip oceango combat capabl and border posit construct as the indian militari ha repeatedli threaten the indian armi of todai is no longer what it wa in 1962 at present the major direct threat to china by the indian militari ar medium rang missil and more

with high target accuraci capabl of deliv nuclear warhead to southern china and all of pakistan in addit india s possess of the capabililti to produc nuclear missil with rocket type guidanc is a threat of concern to the whole world sinc the 1980s the indian air forc ha becom the fourth most power in the world have a reput as south asia s iron fist of which the major sign ar it third and fourth gener aircraft on activ duti it major aircraft type ar the mig 0 23mf the mig 29 and mirag 2000 fighter the mig 23bn the mig 27 and the american tiger fighter bomber meanwhil sinc 1985 india ha begun to acquir airborn warn and control aircraft so the indian air forc ha all weather and long distanc air combat and ground strike capabl have made the transit from air defens to a combin of offens and defens we see india as a potenti adversari mainli becaus india s strateg focu remain on the indian ocean and southeast asia but while india ha never chang it territori demand against china still forcibl occupi a larg piec of china s southwestern border territori india doe not yet have the overal nation and militari might for a larg scale invas of tibet or a deep incurs into our hinterland if india set it strateg target at a limit depth of charg into our posit of 100 or 200 km while it might reach these strateg target the loss would outweigh the gain and it would ultim not be abl to hold them meanwhil china ha not taken back our lost territori by forc becaus while we could win we could not hold in which case we can draw the follow conclus 1 there is littl possibl of a larg scale militari conflict or local war break out between china and india in the short term the shape of the antagon will be mainli friction surround the tibet problem 2 onc a war doe break out between china and india it intens and impact will be no less than medium scale a still impos deterr forc russia as the successor to the former soviet union while russia ha lost it superpow statu as an equal to the

unit state there still will be no other countri in the world that is it equal russia now ha 2 8 million troop 75 percent that of the former soviet union which even when reduc as plan will remain at a size of 1 5 million meanwhil russia possess over 80 percent of the former soviet union s nuclear weapon with convent weapon also about the same as the unit state overal the second nuclear disarma treati sign by the unit state and russia in earli 1992 will reduc both side strateg nuclear warhead by two third within a decad cut the unit state back from 12 000 to 3 500 and russia s from 10 800 to 3 000 sharpli reduc both side first strike nuclear capabl and danger for the first time but despit thi as both side will still retain enough nuclear warhead for mutual destruct it is easi to see russia s might on 16 march 1992 yeltsin sign a presidenti order decid to establish a russian feder nation defens forc then on 7 april yeltsin also announc to the russian congress that russia wa immedi begin to reorgan russia s militari which wa the start of russia s forc build process as well as an adjust of it forc build ideolog and strateg theori it ha been disclos that russia s new militari strategi is compos of four essenti element 1 the fundament militari strategi proposit russia hold that the russian militari s futur basic mission will be to ensur the inviol of russia s sovereignti territori and border 2 the basic militari strategi substanc russia see it neighbor countri as it major combat target regard war with neighbor countri as the basic ground for it combat prepar 3 the fundament militari strategi principl while russia ha made not take the initi to launch attack against it neighbor countri it kei militari strategi principl it also emphas that defens mean an activ initi and that it oper aim is firmli and clearli to not allow war to move onto russian territori and to be capabl of inflict such heavi loss on enemi that it will be hard for them to recov and in order to achiev thi oper aim the russian militari need to have power combat capabl and mobil 4 the basic estim of the futur war form russia hold that there is veri littl possibl of a nuclear war break out in the world in the futur so that convent war will be the basic form of futur war russia is the strongest of all countri border china be the countri that occupi the most chines territori and the on with the most complex histor entangl with china with mani border point still disput by both side but while russia s reorgan militari will pose a direct threat to china the current outlook is that russia s domest and foreign affair have not been final with quit grim econom condit and veri sharp conflict among nation and with other ci countri so that for the next decad russia will be too busi to pai attent to the east still do as much as possibl diplomat to cooper better with the asia pacif region so while there is veri littl possibl that russia will us militari forc against the asia pacif region it need to be point out that as a militarili great nation russia s exist per se ha an indispens impact on the world order with russia s everi word and deed remain of great nation signific a constantli heat up peripheri hotspot that could touch off local war in the two plu year sinc the breakup of the soviet union the asia pacif region ha been calm and tranquil a scene of prosper and highli uniqu in the midst of the sharp turbul in the world order with an air of prospect be uniqu good in thi area it almost seem that in the replac of the old order with the new the asia pacif region ha onli opportun but no challeng in which case how might thi situat chang in the futur for china in particular as the kei strong point in asia s polit and militari struggl what will the situat be like the central militari commiss s judgment is that the situat will be exception grim there ar now eight hotspot directli threaten china s secur uniti and territori integr which might touch off local arm conflict or even war the ever sharpen south china sea conflict in mai 1992 the china maritim petroleum compani sign an oil contract in beij with the us creston energi corp for the vanguard bank in the

similar to that of the 1950s confront on the roof of the world in 1988 a chines militari offic who had taken part in the mission to fortifi our border against india said that it seem that the indian

scale local war in 1962 result in a crush defeat for india but after 26 year of develop india ha becom an asian militari power in on leap with it expansionari ambit heat up again so that it renew it territori demand on china in 1988 threaten to aveng it humili of 1962 push both side for a time to the verg of war in the last two year as the indian govern ha adjust it polici while sino indian relat have eas somewhat it remain hard to predict whether border disput can be resolv peacefulli a territori rift of 9 6 million sq km in addit to peripher hotspot china s intern separatist tendenc similarli threaten our nation secur and territori integr also be like to touch off local arm conflict and war so both ethnic and region divis ar gener subject to meddl by outsid forc mean that if a

the unit state give the insuffer arrog unit state a crush defeat in the earli 1960s the chines armi conduct a self defens counterattack against india under rare high altitud condit in which the valiant and indomit chines armi directli target the indian capit of new delhi knock down the indian militari s arrog and ensur almost three decad of peac on the sino indian border in the late 1960s the chines armi had a confront on it northern border with a militari superpow the former soviet union conduct a self defens counterattack on zhenbao island uphold our nation digniti and territori integr in the mid 1970s the young chines navi carri out a test of strength with a great dispar of might against vietnam in the paracel island give a deserv return blow to vietnam s hegemonist ambit in the late 1970s the chines armi oper beyond our border for the first time carri out a limit strateg strike to penal vietnam which wa a sever blow to the littl tyrant in the late 1980s china and vietnam had anoth clash in the spratli in which the chines navi took onli 28 minut to inflict heavi loss on the vietnames militari fight a clean neat and veri brilliant battl these oper exampl certainli show the chines govern s solemn and just stand in defend nation sovereignti and capabl in settl local conflict while thi show that the chines armi ha accumul certain experi in fight local war it need to be note that these war were still yesterdai s war greatli differ from todai s high tech local war under modern condit so for the chines armi fight a high tech local war on modern term remain a brand new problem be an unpreced test of cours the chines armi s advantag and disadvantag and strength and weak in futur local war ar certainli not unmeasur unknown we can now evalu them as follow strength 1 the chines armi ha a quit power nuclear back as for local war it nuclear forc is a nuclear threat to contain adversari 2 the chines armi ha a quit strong missil strike capabl with almost all countri on it peripheri within it rang of coverag 3 as the local war that the chines armi will face ar on it doorstep it ha geograph and popular advantag 4 the chines armi ha alwai maintain a huge superior in convent weapon 5 the chines armi ha first rate and good qualiti offic and men weak 1 the chines armi ha not yet been abl to establish an advantag in it soft casualti inflict capabl 2 our command and advanc warn system remain quit backward and ineffici 3 our naval and air forc equip remain quit weak leav our triphibi warfar capabl fall short of our ambit 4 the chines armi still doe not have a larg scale tactic rapid mobil capabl make it quit hard to achiev strateg surpris it is thu obviou that in futur local war the kei to success will be how well the chines armi plai it strength up and weak down in quest of the best strateg and tactic mean suit to it particular featur ii a strong but impoverish militari forc it ha been reveal by person in the know that not long ago a team of high rank specialist and technician from china made three secret visit to the ukrain the purpos of these visit wa to check out the ukrain attack carrier of the varyag class thi ship ha a displac of 67 000 ton it can carri 24 su 27 bomber as publish and mig 29 fighter it can control 50 time as much water area as a destroy if china is abl to purchas thi carrier it will be abl to offset 500 taiwanes vietnames philippin indian or malaysian aircraft chines militari s dream of an aircraft carrier dash onc more the chines militari ha dream of an aircraft carrier for half a centuri the strateg locat for world struggl in the futur ar the ocean in recent year on of the major reason for a number of failur in china s deal with foreign countri ha been that it naval assault forc is too weak it ha alreadi been 10 year sinc deng xiaop propos that the chines navi switch it strateg philosophi from on of coastal defens to on of offshor defens howev china still doe not have thi sort of offshor defens capabl therefor effect offshor defens must reli on an ocean go control forc and deterr forc current china must reli on a few dozen old and weak destroy escort and a hundr or so submarin with thi equip and the qualiti of it men in combat capabl the best china can do is maintain equal with taiwan the philippin indonesia malaysia and vietnam it doe not have ani great superior therefor if china want to control the south china sea and recov the ten of billion of ton of petroleum reserv there it must have an aircraft carrier how much more monei do we need a militari offic ask out loud just for the carrier it would take almost all of our militari expens for a year but thi is just for the float hull to fulli equip it with aircraft vtol command system electron earli warn system weapon system commun system and command and coordin system and to give it convent mainten and repair capabl everi year it would also take all of our militari expens for a year repli the expert mao zedong said that china should have her own aircraft carrier that wa 20 year ago denq xiaop also said that china should have her own aircraft carrier that wa 10 year ago howev becaus china is poor she doe not yet have her own aircraft carrier aircraft carrier aircraft carrier without an aircraft carrier our militari develop cannot be consid to have achiev modern without an aircraft carrier we cannot realli be consid a militari power without a strong naval forc we ar unabl to plai the same role in intern affair as the major nation these ar strong cri from the heart of the chines militari men china s militari expenditur ar pitifulli small in a press confer with foreign report in 1993 foreign minist qian qichen state china s militari expenditur as a percentag of the gross nation product were 2 2 percent in 1985 last year thei were 1 6 percent thi year thei ar estim to be 1 5 percent militari expenditur per capita ar about six dollar in the unit state it is 1 100 and in japan it is 300 thi year china s militari expenditur budget come out to 7 3 billion that of the unit state is 274 3 billion and japan s is 3 37 billion england and franc spend about that much as well calcul per person in the militari the averag for china is 2 291 on eighti seventh of what the unit state spend and on fifti fifth of what japan spend and on fifti fourth of what england spend there ar also inflat factor in 1980 china s militari expenditur were 18 billion yuan and in 1993 42 5 billion militari expenditur onli rose 116 percent while inflat rose 130 percent from thi data we can see that china s militari expenditur per person is onli on two hundredth that of the unit state it is onli on fiftieth that of japan in taiwan when an enlist man retir he can receiv enough resettl expens to open a small shop a colonel on the mainland would not receiv enough to bui commerci hous the size of a bed becaus china is poor the book garland at the foot of the mountain reveal to the peopl of the countri a list of

anoth new model escort thi ha also ad china s first vertic launch system and a new model ship to air fire control system as well as new air search radar thi allow for a mark improv in the degre of autom of the vessel s electron equip and power system becaus the chines navi is respons for protect ocean trade and ocean transport rout and special econom zone as well as maintain a balanc of naval power with other area sinc the 1980 s it ha begun to emphas the develop of larg fleet and long rang deploy and ha conduct amphibi land combat exercis the superior of the chines navi li in it submarin fleet the submarin fleet ha alwai been the pride of the chines navi china now rank third in the world in the number of submarin second onli to the unit state and the former soviet union it ha more than 100 convention power submarin second in the world china s nuclear submarin and patrol missil submarin these can carri 12 nuclear ballist missil with yield from 200 to 5 000 thei can attack most target in the world and can cruis for long period of time under the ocean thi is part of china s nuclear deterr forc the submarin current in servic in china s navi ar of mani type thei number among the most in the world howev in level of submarin design and construct china cannot compar with the unit state and europ china doe howev possess a complet research and product system which doe not requir ani outsid assist thi is the motiv power which will allow for the develop of even newer model of surfac and underwat combat vessel in the futur therefor china pai special attent to it submarin forc especi it missil submarin forc which ar a kei element of the pla navi the submarin current in servic in the chines navi ar 1 the w class the first submarin china built on it own wa the soviet w whiskei class submarin thi class wa base on a modif of a german u 2l submarin captur dure world war ii 2 the r class the r romeo class is the backbon of china s submarin forc those built earlier were call the 031 model es3b those built later were the 033 model the r class is slightli larger than the w class submarin and is more streamlin there wa also some improv of the con tower which is slightli smaller than that of the w class the overal length is 76 8 meter and it is 7 3 meter across the beam the displac is about 1400 ton on the surfac and 1800 ton submerg it ha a continu cruis time of 60 dai it can oper in a fix posit for ten dai it combat radiu is 1800 nautic mile and it cruis speed is nine knot maximum cruis distanc is 9 000 nautic mile 3 the wuhan class in 1981 china complet refit the 033 model submarin ad anti ship missil these were given the design es5g and were also call the wuhan class the major differ in the wuhan class is instal of c 801 model missil insid the cowl bulg along the side of the ship on either side of the con tower the submarin must first surfac and rais the launcher befor it can launch it extern dimens ar similar to those of the 033 model howev it is heavier than the 033 model with a displac of 1650 ton on the surfac and 2100 ton submerg the power equip is also the same as that of the 033 model 4 the g class china s first guid missil submarin wa the soviet g golf class guid missil submarin it serial number is 200 it keel wa laid in 1962 and it wa complet and launch in 1964 the g class submarin is 98 meter long and 8 5 meter across the beam it ha a displac of 2350 ton on the surfac and 2950 ton submerg it is power by 6 000 horsepow and it cruis at 17 knot on the surfac and 13 knot submerg it ha a combat radiu of 20 000 nautic mile 5 the ming class the ming class is a modif of the 033 model it wa us to replac the 033 model submarin it is call the 035 model the extern shape is similar to that of the 033 model although it is just slightli smaller and heavier the first three of these submarin were of the es5c d class and were complet between 1971 and 1979 after 1987 modif were the es5 class which were slightli larger 6 the han class the han class is china s first gener nuclear power submarin china began develop a nuclear power submarin in the late 1950 s construct work on the first nuclear power submarin began in novemb of 1968 it wa launch on 26 decemb 1970 follow launch it went though more than 200 test in the categori of dock test surfac test shallow water test and deep water test all togeth it sail 20 time over 6 000 nautic mile befor complet these test in wa place in servic on 1 august 1974 it is call the changjiang i and it mark china s entri into the nuclear submarin ag 7 the xia class the xia class is china s first nuclear power strateg missil submarin work on it construct began in 1978 and it wa launch in april 1981 it wa place in servic in 1987 it ha been claim that the second of thi class submarin wa launch in 1982 china realli need an aircraft carrier howev becaus of the lack of financ she is not abl to build or bui on to construct a 30 000 to 40 000 ton class aircraft carrier would requir at least 2 to 5 billion yuan lack of financ not onli block aircraft carrier plan china doe not even have the capabl to build a cruiser or a vtol fighter supplement support facil for thi carrier would cost anoth on billion yuan in huangpu in guangzhou there is an old dilapid aircraft carrier it look like a dock it just float there peopl with noth to do walk in small group across it massiv deck thi goe back to 1989 when the chines navi purchas thi carrier from australia to dismantl becaus it is a decommiss aircraft carrier china bought it for the price of a scrap vessel and place it here for refer for chines scientif personnel who have onli seen an aircraft carrier on paper have first hand materi when begin from scratch is of the utmost import these few year the chines naval design personnel have look at it and studi it and there ar often larg group of scientist of differ specialti and from differ agenc who will draw up blueprint studi it and look at it china s simul flight deck wa done us the deck of thi aircraft carrier now that aircraft carrier which wa us for draft and observ is still there for peopl to make us of thi is still china s onli aircraft carrier anoth area where china s navi ha superior is it marin forc most of the personnel come from the armi thi branch ha the capabl of amphibi combat and high mobil it will plai an extrem major role in place militari forc ashor in combat current although the chines marin forc is not larg the chines navi ha a strong transport capabl and base on china s origin battl order deploy most of the vessel would be concentr in the north sea fleet and east sea fleet but the south sea fleet ha recent been equip with two yukang class lst china ha a total of three and in the 1980 s the newli built jingsha class amphibi troop transport it is not difficult to see that at the present time the situat in the nansha island is forc china to begin to consid provid necessari support for naval battl such as provid air support accord to statist the chines navi ha more than 60 larg land ship which in the middl 1990 s will be abl to transport 75 000 troop and 400 tank and armor personnel carrier to locat sever hundr kilomet within 60 to 90 dai thi doe not includ the vessel belong to eight reserv divis and sever mobil air transport divis it can requisit 460 vessel of 1000 ton class or larger with 310 to 315 as dry cargo vessel as well as civilian boat which can supplement personnel suppli china ha also built new model intellig gather boat in recent year china ha built a seri of intellig gather boat base on research vessel and ic breaker which china current possess the largest of these is the xiangyanghong 9 anoth larg intellig gather boat is the dadi class thi class of vessel wa design to track task fleet it ha an ingeni prow and is capabl of fairli high speed china s defens strategi is current in transit toward a deep water defens strategi howev thi strategi onli call for conduct combat on an effect scale sever hundr kilomet from land and not sever thousand kilomet foreign militari expert predict that by earli in the next centuri the chines navi will emphas construct of larg combat ship with advanc equip next by the year 2020 it will construct two to three light aircraft carrier with a displac of 20 000 to 30 000 ton it will build or purchas vtol fighter aircraft for aircraft carrier us it will also purchas or build a batch of ship to form a carrier group by the year 2040 it will have achiev or approach the combat capabl of the unit state and will be abl to go ani place in the world to conduct mission thi is a difficult challeng face the chines navi india ha alreadi purchas two british built aircraft carrier and is prepar to bui anoth and to build three of it own the japanes naval self defens forc alreadi ha more destroy and escort ship than china or india focus on chines superior in submarin over india japan ha develop a first rate anti submarin forc it recent pass a law to allow for forc to be sent outsid of japan actual it alreadi rank sixth in the world the chines air forc on the ev of the establish of the new china the pla onli had on air squadron and eight field anti aircraft artilleri regiment respons for air defens combat after the formal establish of the air forc in novemb of 1949 organ unit were assign from the armi and the backbon cadr wa made up of outstand offic and men some intellectu and technic personnel from the former nationalist air forc first of all thei establish some flight school and then set up unit by 1956 thei had alreadi form a larg batch of air divis after 1957 the air defens forc and air forc combin and the air forc ad anti aircraft artilleri forc search light forc radar forc and ground to air missil forc sinc 1978 air forc unit have phase out old equip improv the man system and ad combat personnel result in a more profession and ideal organ by the 1980 s the pla air forc had becom a modern combat forc capabl of independ conduct the air defens mission over nation territori and also capabl of coordin land sea and air combat the more than 40 year of it develop can be divid into three major stage the first stage is from 1949 to 1953 which wa the temper stage of it establish and the korean war thi wa follow by the overal construct and develop stage of 1954 to 1976 the third stage wa the new stage usher in an entir new era our air forc now ha air forc anti aircraft artilleri forc ground to air missil forc radar forc and commun forc these ar the primari forc us by our air forc in aerial combat and to attack surfac target from the air the air forc current ha 590 000 men includ 220 000 in strateg unit with 5 200 combat aircraft china is divid up into ten militari air district it headquart is

western militari aviat technolog is as far ahead as we first believ no wonder that later when the unit state sold f 16 fighter to taiwan thei frankli state that in consider of the recent purchas of a

chemic industri electron and textil on 26 septemb 1991 when some peopl on the island of taiwan began to deni that thei were chines jiang weiguo publish an articl in the unit state state that some peopl have fabric the concept which separ the region interest of taiwan from the overal interest of china into two oppos faction thei claim that thi is the univers common demand of the peopl live on taiwan thei state that attempt to unifi china ar abandon the wish of 20 million peopl on taiwan jiang weiguo continu to critic thi he said that the mainland and taiwan ar intim ti togeth and that unit thei enjoi common prosper and peac and divid both side ar in danger and in difficulti he felt that those who ar advoc split ar lai the wai for major power to invad china he hope that all chines at home and oversea will not divid themselv by provinc not divid themselv by polit faction but should base on the fact that we ar all chines work to promot the giant undertak of unit china he felt that all chines on either side of the strait and all over the world have three common desir first is that chines peopl can onli be peac at home and strong in foreign affair if there is on singl china second is that thei all hope that thei can have a good life third is that thei can gain the respect of the entir world while make thi small histor footnot the taiwan nationalist author admit that the unif of china is the common aspir of all the chines peopl it is also the best wai of unit all chines peopl to work togeth for the advanc of the chines race and a strong countri taiwan independ would be the fuse for recoveri by forc take back jinmen with a salut to the spirit of it hero page 25 of origin miss the most import thing in thi offens struggl wa to have boat there had to be boat the kei to victori or defeat wa whether or not the boat which could onli transport the first echelon forc would be abl to return quickli after transport the first echelon unit and quickli carri the second echelon unit in order to accomplish thi object three staff offic from the armi headquart were to be sent out with the first echelon unit their mission wa to be respons for supervis and speed up the return trip howev becaus thei had not been complet right about the sea condit the three staff offic tell a rough stori the stori of staff offic li who had accompani the 244th regiment until the land forc had secur a posit on the beachhead the fire wa too fierc and the worker on the boat all lai down to dodg the bullet and it wa imposs to organ the ship for the return trip when the unit had establish a posit on the beachhead and when the tide had gone down to expos an addit 10 m of beach all of the boat had run aground the 244th regiment could onli keep on attack there wa no hope of ani help from protect forc all li could do wa take it on hi own to order the boat worker to do their best to free the boat thei onli push off a few wooden boat becaus thei could not budg the motor boat a mortar shell came fly in blow li to bit and of the boat which had been freed onli two made the return trip to lianhua harbor no on know what happen to the other the stori of staff offic lin who accompani the 251st regiment fortun he notic that the tide wa reced rapidli and as soon as thei reach the shore he immedi order the ship to return make the soldier wade ashor on third of the boat twenti of them stai in the water and did not becom ground howev just after these boat had left jinmen thei were intercept by two nationalist gunboat the boat did not have ani protect weapon and in the battl staff offic lin tri to protect the boat after turn over command to the senior man he took over on of the boat and ram on of the gunboat take it to the bottom with him mani of the boat carri the 259th regiment also becam ground becaus it took more time to accomplish their land howev staff offic wang point hi pistol at the head of on of the battalion command make him assign a compani to push the ground boat back into the water more of thi regiment s boat were save than ani of the other s if these boat had been abl to return without ani problem it is possibl that the outcom of the battl would have been differ howev these boat becam lost and sail into nationalist control water and were mistaken for nationalist support boat by our long rang artilleri and all of them were sunk staff offic wang wa abl to us hi pistol to forc the command of the 3rd battalion to send troop to help free the boat and he us similar method to forc six soldier to remain on the boat to protect them on their wai back but he wa unabl to signal the coastal artilleri that thei were friendli forc regrett he wa kill by fire from hi own forc with the second echelon forc unabl to follow the three regiment could onli fight on their own the bloodi battl last three dai and night the brave pla land forc had no suppli and had no support under extrem difficult condit the isol forc fought a bloodi fight caus heavi casualti among the nationalist forc dure these three dai and night it wa almost on bloodi battl after anoth each engag wa wors than the on befor thi kept up until thei ran out of ammunit and lost their posit and almost all the 10 000 heroic soldier di brave in the battl some jump into the ocean and drown and some of the wound were taken prison howev the jinmen campaign wa a defeat thi is on of the few mistak in the gener s life it is also someth he ha regret hi entir life the next battl of jinmen is perhap not worth mention not worth fight thi battl is after all the first step on the wai to taiwan thi step will be taken by salvo by the coastal artilleri howev these salvo will not be like the convent gun and propaganda gun but will be small home missil each missil will seek out the combat headquart on jinmen thei will all be aim at the artilleri placement and combat vessel on jinmen thei will all hit their target and each will caus a great deal of damag thei will give no heed to ordinari battlework scatter troop or light weapon thei will hit onli kei place a strike of sever hour could paralyz the nerv network on the island and the naval forc would be abl to mop up with no troubl at all will the primari battl to recov taiwan be fought on taiwan taiwan is situat more than 100 kilomet off the southeast coast of the chines mainland the pacif ocean is to it east and it is surround by the penghu island diaoyu island the chiwei island the pengyu lanyu and huoshao island it cover 30 000 squar kilomet and ha a popul of 20 million the size of the taiwan straight is just enough to fit the island of taiwan the citi of xiamen is 170 nautic mile from kaohsiung on the southern end of the island the citi of fuzhou is 150 nautic mile from the port of jilong on the northern end of the island the beauti island of taiwan it ha been the sacr territori of china sinc ancient time in 1624 and in 1626 the dutch and the spanish colonialist invad tainan and jilong and from these two area expand their invas at the end of the ming dynasti in 1661 chines hero zheng chenggong led a larg forc which recov taiwan follow the sino japanes war in 1891 taiwan wa forcibl occupi by the japanes invad dure the miser year of coloni rule under occup by the japanes imperialist the struggl of the compatriot on taiwan to return to the embrac of the motherland never ceas includ the taiwan aborigin upris in taichung there were more than 20 fairli larg scale battl and as mani as 100 000 peopl were kill follow the end of world war ii in 1945 accord to the cairo declar and the potsdam agreement suzerainti over taiwan wa restor to china taiwan had been return to the bosom of china when the mainland wa liber in 1949 the chiang kai shek cliqu fled to taiwan and in 1950 the unit state imperialist us arm forc to invad our sacr territori of taiwan taiwan ha a histori of be invad and the chines peopl on both side of the strait have no further desir for the fire and smoke of battl war mean destruct whether arm might is us to recov taiwan or whether peac reunif method ar us the final goal of the mainland is to unit the peopl and materi resourc of the chines peopl to vigor develop the economi of china and to make the chines race stronger base on thi principl the recoveri of taiwan must not damag the econom structur of taiwan therefor no matter what the circumst a destruct recoveri of taiwan cannot be undertaken it is possibl to forese that the main battlefield will not be on the island the main battl mai take place in the water not far offshor from taiwan it is predict that it would be in the water near the penghu archipelago natur the final decis fight will still have to be a struggl for each individu mountain citi or villag howev in the bloodi fight neither nuclear weapon nor chemic weapon will be us but onli convent weapon as an old teacher onc said thi fight is with our own peopl so there should be limit some wai should be found to avoid a lot of kill the taiwanes ar even less will to see the destruct of the battl in their own backyard with the assist of the unit state thei want to fight a battl of extinct on the ocean thei want to wipe out the communist navi in the taiwan strait thu the will of both side ha determin that the battl for the recoveri of taiwan will be fought at the taiwan strait would be an integr test of naval and air forc imagin thi the fierc battl is a naval and air battl in the taiwan strait thi would be a battl pit warship against aircraft at such a time the south sea fleet and the west branch of the east sea fleet would be the first echelon unit the plan would be to join up at the penghu gulf thei would not want the nationalist to us that old tactic of their again get the fight over with befor the second echelon of communist forc can arriv therefor format of squadron after squadron of f 14 tomcat fighter and bomber with f 16 fighter fly cover could swarm like bee toward the fleet the bomb would fall like rain the thousand of gun in our navi fleet would lai a dens barrag of ten of thousand of round per minut the sky would be fill with yellow nitrat smoke the explod fragment would fall like hail from the sky rais rippl all over the surfac of the water the enemi aircraft would dive as if hit in a mad attack of the fleet some plane would trail plume of smoke on their wai to plung into the ocean but as on echelon goe past it would be follow up by anoth echelon right behind it two of our transport ship have been hit on is alreadi close the three seal hatch and on the other ship the soldier ar us their field pack to try to stop the water from pour in there in the hold of the ship thei would be helpless and curs the admir thi gener is realli too much for all these year he ha just been a synonym for the nationalist puff after puff of black smoke would dot the deck of the cruiser and destroy leav dent and hole behind them imagin after all is onli imagin what would the realiti look like as on of the four tiger of asia taiwan not onli ha strong econom might but it also ha a fairli respect militari strength it equip and technolog ar mostli superior to those of the mainland mostli advanc us equip after diplomat relat between the unit state and taiwan came to an end becaus of it consider for the establish of an independ defens system under the guid philosophi of the taiwanes militari to substitut for time with qualiti militari expenditur grew everi year these expenditur have grown from 278 4 million in 1979 to 1 1 billion in 1993 it ha emphas it air forc and navi taiwan ha 248 primari combat aircraft the main forc of which ar the f 5e and the f l04g interceptor these ar second gener fighter their combat capabl ar not quit as good as the f 8 their overal combat strength is less than that of the mainland howev after their import 150 f 16 and 60 mirag fighter and their addition plan 130 self design idf aircraft ar us to equip their unit their air forc will overal be better and will be of a new gener of aircraft at such time the taiwan forc will possess 350 third gener new all weather combat aircraft thi will make it even more difficult for the mainland to win and maintain air superior over the strait taiwan forc current have more than 300 combat vessel it main forc combat ship ar patrol boat guid missil boat destroy guid missil escort submarin lst mine sweeper and suppli boat it overal combat capabl ar greater than on of the mainland fleet but less than two of the mainland fleet it ha fewer submarin than the mainland and doe not have a nuclear submarin we can see from the abov that the variou forc do not have the strateg capabl of conduct an attack on the mainland thi fact is an integr part of the long term guid philosophi of the variou forc of a strategi to maintain the statu quo and defens warfar howev from the combat region in the taiwan strait the taiwan militari ha a fairli high densiti of weapon to us to defend against an attack from the mainland and these weapon ar fairli modern within a limit period of time it will be difficult break down the defens of the taiwanes forc therefor thi engag in the taiwan strait would be a fierc modern battl how larg of a forc will china us air forc there ar a total of 490 000 men and about 5 200 combat aircraft in the chines air forc if the 38 000 men and the 800 land base combat aircraft of the naval air forc ar includ the air supremaci forc would be 6 000 aircraft sinc thi is no longer the 1950 s when the talk wa to push old chiang kai shek into the ocean these aircraft should be enough to recov taiwan if taiwan threw 80 percent of it combat aircraft into the battl thi would be 280 advanc third gener fighter then for the mainland to take and maintain air superior it would have to us at least 40 percent of it aircraft deploi almost 2 400 aircraft along the southeastern coast from sheer number alon thi would be a ten to on margin and would assembl a forc of absolut superior howev from the viewpoint of qualiti at least 40 percent of china s air forc would have to be third gener aircraft china would have to us at least 1 000 fighter at least 400 of which would have to be f 8 aircraft at the same time thei could also deploi around 600 bomber includ around 80 b 6 medium bomber around 250 b 5 light bomber and around 300 fighter bomber to be us for an attack on taiwan forc posit on the beachhead in addit there should also a certain number of jiancha 6 reconnaiss aircraft be 6 seaplan zhi 5 helicopt and some transport aircraft navi at a minimum the north and south sea fleet would have to be us with an independ submarin squadron with almost 750 combat vessel and more than 100 land craft the land unit would be 100 000 men in their deploy consider should be given to a pincer attack from two differ direct as well as prevent the us seventh fleet from provid assist attent should be given to the fact that make the best us of submarin superior is the kei to victori in a battl in the strait it is also the most effect mean for the mainland to deliv a crush blow against the taiwan navi furthermor the surfac vessel of the mainland s navi will mainli conduct a contain attack against the taiwan navi and an even larger forc will be us in support fight and in the land combat in thi wai it would be easier to gain control of the initi in combat as quickli as possibl china current ha more submarin than all other nation except for the unit state and the former soviet union third in the world it current ha more than 100 convention power submarin second in the world china s submarin forc were built up fairli earli back when the former soviet union pacif fleet wa us the port of lushun thei began to train china s submarin student class on 20 august 1953 china establish a submarin school in qingdao and ask the soviet for an old c class submarin thi wa the first submarin in china s navi on 19 june 1954 china establish an independ submarin dadui in qinghai with four submarin transfer over from the soviet two of these were s stalinetz class offshor submarin and two were m malodaki class coastal submarin later the soviet continu to deliv a number of submarin until china s navi had four 5 i submarin four shchuka model submarin and four m 12 submarin as well as on m iv and m v submarin dure thi time the soviet suppli technolog on pressur hull propel and air defens system china began to develop it own submarin so far china ha built a fairli larg number of soviet type submarin and ha design three type on her own includ two type of nuclear submarin in a battl us arm forc to recov taiwan all of china s submarin would be us these includ the w class the r class the wuhan class the g class the ming class and the xia class submarin the w class submarin is 76 meter long and 6 5 meter wide it ha a displac of 1 080 on the surfac and 1 320 submerg it can carri 14 torpedo or 24 mine it ha 4 000 horsepow and maximum surfac speed is 18 knot submerg it us two electr motor 2700 horsepow for a maximum speed of 14 knot it combat radiu is 1 800 nautic mile with a maximum rang of as much as 2 400 nautic mii up until the mid 1980 s the w class submarin patrol the water of the xisha paracel island period these submarin ar still us for train the r class is slightli larger than the w class and it is more streamlin the con tower is also improv slightli smaller than on the w class thi submarin is 76 8 meter long and 7 3 meter wide it ha a surfac displac of 1 400 ton and a submerg displac of 1 800 ton at speed of nine knot it ha a maximum cruis rang of 9 000 nautic mile the 033 model of thi submarin is arm with 28 mine or 16 torpedo it electron equip is fairli advanc some of the 033 model can be equip panoram sonar system includ passiv sonar ranger and cyclic vision sonar listen devic which can detect all sonar transmiss within the two to fifteen kilohertz rang thei can also track three target at the same time within a 120 degre sector in 1980 dure a visit to shanghai by the british navi some personnel tour a 033 model submarin thei notic that the ship had a larg number of machin gun which were said to be for us in offshor naval patrol the greatest differ in the wuhan class is that there ar c 801 missil instal in the bulg cowl on either side of the con tower to launch these missil the submarin must first come to the surfac and rais the missil launcher befor the missil can be launch the extern dimens ar about the same as those of the 033 model but it is heavier than the 033 model with a surfac displac of 1 650 ton and a submerg displac of 2 100 ton the power equip is also similar to that of the 033 model the c 801 is also call the yingji yj l model it is a high subson speed low altitud sea sweep multipl us anti ship missil it is china s newest anti ship missil it us inerti mid flight guidanc and activ monopuls radar termin guidanc when it approach the target it dive to attack it and hit the target near the water line launch rang is 8 to 40 kilomet there is now an improv model the c 802 which ha a solid state booster and replac the origin solid state engin with a turbojet engin so an air intak ha been ad to the missil there ha been no chang in the type of guidanc or in the flight altitud minimum and maximum launch rang ar 15 and 150 kilomet respect accord to materi made public by china the wuhan class ha a crew of 53 men it can submerg to 200 meter and ha a continu cruis capabl of 45 dai at speed of nine knot it can travel 14 000 kilomet the g class submarin is 98 meter long and 8 5 meter wide it ha a surfac displac of 2 350 ton and a submerg displac of 2 950 ton it ha 6 000 horsepow which can drive the submarin at 17 knot on the surfac and 13 knot submerg combat radiu is 20 000 nautic mile becaus it is equip with the css n3 julang jl l missil develop by china on her own which is larger in diamet than the ssn 4 there ar onli two missil launcher in the con tower the julang 1 model missil is the onli underwat launch missil the outsid world is awar that china possess supposedli it is a modifi version of the dongfeng 3 or dongfeng 4 land base missil it ha a two stage solid fuel rocket and the warhead ha a yield of 2 megaton launch rang is about 2 700 kilomet in addit the g class submarin can carri 12 torpedo the ming class shape li somewher in between the cigar shape of the 033 model and a teardrop shape it is 76 meter long and 7 6 meter wide it ha a displac of 1 584 ton on the surfac and 2 113 ton submerg the power system is similar to that of the 033 model it ha speed of 15 knot on the surfac and a maximum speed of 18 knot submerg cruis rang is about 7 000 nautic mile it can submerg to about 300 meter the crew size is 58 men it can carri 16 torpedo or 28 mine it electron equip is similar to that of the 033 model and includ a reconnaiss type or reconnaiss disc type horizon search radar stop light and electron support equip and atla or phoenix type activ and passiv sonar the ming class ha good underwat capabl but is expens to build the han class submarin is shape similarli to the us ssn 671 unicorn class submarin it teardrop shape bodi is suit to high speed submerg cruis it us a cross shape rudder it ha a submerg displac of about 5 000 ton it is about 100 meter long and 11 meter wide it ha a pressur water reactor pile singl shaft drive and a maximum speed of 25 knot submerg and 30 knot on the surfac the xia class is about 120 meter long and about 10 meter wide it ha a submerg displac of about 8 000 ton it ha a pressur water reactor pile and power is rate at about 90 megawatt it is a singl shaft drive and maximum submerg speed is about 22 knot it ha a crew of 84 it can submerg to a depth of 300 meter it primari weaponri includ 12 css n 3 julang missil these ar two stage solid fuel missil thei mai be in the midst of be replac with multipl warhead css n 4 missil there ar also six 21 inch torpedo launch tube in the nose of the submarin china cannot compar with the unit state and european nation in the level of submarin design and construct howev it doe possess a complet research and product system which doe not requir ani assist from foreign furthermor thi is precis the motiv for futur develop of new underwat combat vessel therefor china is pai special attent to it submarin forc especi missil submarin forc which ar the kei branch of the pla navi the second artilleri forc ar a strateg attack forc thei alreadi have a certain number of intercontinent ballist missil medium rang and sub medium rang missil it intercontinent ballist missil includ four css 3 missil with a rang of 6000 to 7000 kilomet and carri a warhead of from on to three megaton it is believ that the css 4 ha alreadi gone into product it ha a rang of 13 000 kilomet and carri a five to 10 megaton warhead the medium rang missil includ 65 to 85 css 2 missil with a rang of 2500 kilomet and carri a on to three megaton warhead the sub medium rang missil is the css 1 of which thei have about 50 it ha a rang of 180 kilomet and carri a 1 5 kiloton warhead the outlook would be better if we had an aircraft carrier in novemb of 1991 china s intern lead edg weapon exposit wa jointli host by the gener staff depart of the pla and the commiss for scienc and industri in nation defens at the militari museum it wa onli open to person in the militari industri and govern at the naval exhibit the exhibit of a model of an aircraft carrier and an aircraft carrier task forc by the naval develop and test center attract a larg group of chines men of vision the spokesman explain in detail the dream and equip of a futur chines aircraft carrier it wa then that the listen understood that build an aircraft carrier wa not as simpl as build a ship in the ten of thousand of ton class but that it involv the nation industri level of a seri of technolog as well as suppli it with a larg amount of support system in gener an aircraft carrier group ha four major part 1 the hull of the carrier thi is the sea and air mobil platform 2 the variou fighter bomber anti submarin helicopt awac and patrol and reconnaiss aircraft carri on the carrier 3 the carrier s radar missil electron warfar gun and flight deck and take off and land equip as a singl major system 4 support vessel destroy escort submarin land craft conting of marin and suppli and support vessel thi conceptu synthesi is the proper concept of a carrier combat group onli thi type of carrier task forc would have the assault forc to control the sea and control the ski at thi exhibit the deputi command of the navi li jing the command of the air forc wang hai the chairman of the commiss for scienc and industri in nation defens ding henggao and hi vice chairmen xie guang and ye zhengda remain at the carrier exhibit for a long time and provid a great deal of support peopl ar awar that to build a carrier task forc like the on describ abov the cost would be astronom from what we have heard earli in the next centuri the chines navi plan to possess two carrier task forc the carrier construct would be 40 000 to 50 000 ton medium size aircraft carrier similar to the soviet kiev class aircraft carrier there would be 20 to 28 aircraft park on the flight deck the flight deck would be 70 meter long it would us steam to launch the aircraft everyth be equal these two carrier task forc would cost an estim 70 billion yuan there ar three critic technolog in aircraft carrier the first is the develop of carrier aircraft and master take off and land technolog the second is the develop of anti submarin technolog solv the problem of underwat threat to the carrier secondari to thi is the problem of task forc air defens thi requir phase arrai radar technolog the third critic technolog just happen to be a weak of the chines air forc face an increasingli seriou situat in the nansha island the chines navi ha contact a number of nation try to find some wai to solv the problem of beef up their anti submarin system in 1985 the chines navi purchas a french duux 5 sonar for the possibl purpos of the anti submarin research so urgent need for missil nuclear submarin it is estim that there ha been some progress made on thi in 1988 the chines navi contact the italian express a great deal of interest in itali s sonar combat system and multifunct control consol in addit the chines navi is also interest in the french pivaiv stabl anti submarin equip thei have alreadi test the french mincin inerti guidanc system on surfac vessel in 1986 the unit state navi agre to sell tow phase arrai sonar equip to china research on carrier aircraft includ carrier fighter to gain control of the ski and provid air defens for the carrier forc carrier bomber to carri out bomb assault mission and carrier awac to track enemi target and to guid and control their aircraft to intercept and bomb target will the unit state becom involv as the policeman of the world the unit state militari act as a nuclear umbrella for taiwan should there ever be a militari threat against taiwan thei would never stand idli by no matter what taiwan s posit might be in the fight thei would certainli us such an opportun to express their concern and support for taiwan from consider of global strategi the unit state would not allow a strong oppon to aris in east asia in 1992 cincpac conven a special symposium on the problem of a new militari strategi for the pacif region it wa point out at thi symposium that the overal strength of the chines militari is continu to grow and serious affect the militari balanc in the far east there ar current more than 10 region confront hot spot and a number of border conflict in the far east with a high possibl of lead to local war in the futur in addit to be on the alert to russian forc the us forc station in the far east will also have the chines korean and vietnames as primari adversari at the same time the us seventh fleet will view the rapidli expand chines navi as on of the primari adversari constitut the greatest threat in that region but to what degre would the unit state becom involv simpli the largest task forc outsid the countri is respons for the primari strateg mission in the western pacif the seventh fleet includ the task forc of the seventh fleet the carrier strike forc the fifth carrier group the seventh carrier group and 60 000 marin it is the world s largest fleet deploi to the front and it conduct it mission in the water of the western pacif south pacif indian ocean and arabian sea 11 000 nautic mile from

should the order ever be given thei could reach the water of the taiwan strait in a veri short time yet if the unit state tri to us thi opportun to surgic remov the chines navi or to carri out a plan of plunder the chines water we want to effect warn them that thei will have to have an even larger carrier fleet what will be the final outcom of the war the kei to what will determin the final outcom of an arm recoveri of taiwan will be the result of the confront between the arm forc from either side of the taiwan strait if the mainland is abl to destroi the taiwanes navi and air forc within the preset amount of time then the author on taiwan will give up try to resist in order to avoid the destruct of war on their island if the mainland is not abl to destroi the main bodi of resist of the taiwanes forc then thei will not be abl to conduct a land and the situat will be veri grim there is on other possibl situat where the mainland is onli abl to attack a portion of the target in the preset period of time and the defens system of the taiwanes forc is about to fall but ha not complet fallen at such a time there could be strang and complex chang in the situat and the unit state and other extern factor could gener a major influenc on the situat in summari the problem of the return of taiwan is better resolv by peac mean than by arm forc iv will we be abl to reenact the glori of 1962 histori often repeat itself howev in the face of the militari power which ha arisen in asia india peopl cannot help have a certain reserv about thi law of histori alwai repeat itself actual look over the more than 2 000 kilomet border between china and india it is veri easi for peopl to come to the conclus that of the two side oppos each other across thi border the indian forc appear to have overwhelm superior at the first outpost at the sino indian border there ar two oppos fortif with the chines to the north and the indian to the south onli 27 meter apart not far awai there is a postal facil in the neutral zone everi dai the surfac mail between these two countri must be exchang here the border defens forc of the two countri must stand guard dure the exchang of the mail when thi is done the guard from both side must enter the neutral zone where thei almost come face to face when relat between the two countri were normal the troop from either side would often call out hello hello to those on the other side and even exchang small gift in the 1960 s and 1970 s the indian border troop gave the chines troop the impress of be poor and dirti and thei would take out a pack of cigarett to give to them after the 1980 s the chines forc suddenli notic that thi batch of beard soldier had suddenli straighten up chang into nylon uniform which were all the same the old clumsi former soviet rifl thei carri had been exchang for impress british arm look further back into indian territori road after road stretch out form a modern transport network everi weekend sedan would arriv on after anoth carri the famili of the troop to the front line while thei were enjoi themselv the chines troop had to do without such pleasur when the sino indian border heat up in 1989 chines unit were rush in to beef up defens and both side were face each other although no shot were fire quit a few of the chines offic and men had to be taken to a field hospit to be treat for frost bite but the indian forc did not seem to be affect natur the situat in the ski wa even more tens with the indian s deploi almost 200 combat aircraft while the chines did not have ani combat aircraft except for a few on standbi the air power ratio wa 200 to none thi wa an unthink situat imagin what would have happen to the chines front line defens unit if the indian had actual attack over the entir front it goe without sai that the chines troop becam awar that the old feel of superior wa gone thi is the current situat at the indo chines border a histor flashback befor we attempt to analyz the balanc of forc for the next engag between india and china we should look back at the situat dure the 1962 border war histor the indo chines border ha never been formal delin howev over the long process of amic coexist between the peopl of the two countri and in accord with the scope of polit control of both countri a 2000 km commonli recogn boundari wa form the western end start from the north in the

histor chines area of menou luoyu and xiachaou into british india attempt to occupi 90 000 squar kilomet of chines territori although the notori macmahon line ha never been recogn by ani chines govern it is the caus of the border disput between china and india from 1951 to 1953 the author of independ india took advantag of the period when new china had just been establish and while it wa fight the

reject these demand on behalf of the chines govern thereupon the indian govern began to us arm might to carri out it polici of advanc and began to make prepar for a larg scale attack on china that same year the indian armi took over the defens of the entir indo chines border region in octob of 1962 the indian defens ministri announc the establish of a new armi the fourth armi and name armi chief of staff gener lahiri as the command of the new armi prior to launch the assault india had on brigad six infantri battalion on machin gun battalion and a number of detach total more than 5 600 men on the western sector of the border with china of these 1 300 men were deploi in 43 stronghold insid of chines territori the eastern sector wa india s main direct of attack and thei had deploi four battalion of the seventh brigad and four battalion of the fourth artilleri brigad in chines territori north of the macmahon line at kejielang bangshank and south of there in dawang and deploi the

20 the indian forc launch an all out attack on chines territori on the eastern and western sector on that dai border defens unit in tibet and xinjiang receiv order to counterattack open the curtain on the self defens counterattack on the indo chines border the first stage of the counterattack last from 20 to 28 octob chines border defens unit separ launch all out counterattack on the invad indian armi on the eastern and western sector thei also concentr a superior forc along the primari direct in just eight dai thei had wipe out 86 percent of the armi stronghold along the western sector and drove out the indian forc which had invad the kelangji and dawang area kill some of them on 24 octob the chines govern issu a three point propos to stop the fight to reopen peac talk and for a peac

counterattack against the invad indian forc in thi battl the chines border defens forc successfulli util the concentr of a superior forc to conduct a pincer movement and flank attack penetr deep into the indian forc so that the indian forc were be attack at mani point and could neither protect their front or rear the chines forc smoothli achiev their object of drive all the indian forc out of their territori thi 31 dai local war end at the tragic cost of the live of 8 700 indian troop the perfect combat capabl of the chines forc in tradit warfar and especi their abil in hand to hand fight and in night fight amaz all the indian troop thi attitud of aw remain in the heart of the beard troop for a veri long time the next war will not be so easi with the present state of the chines and indian forc in the next war the form and strength of both side ar noth like thei were in 1962 both side ar clear on thi point the war in the 1960 s wa typic tradit surfac warfar there wa no sign of the air forc on the battlefield let alon missil or even ani armor forc worth mention the primari weapon engag were semi automat infantri rifl assault gun light and heavi machin gun 60 and 80 mm mortar and 122 mm howitz the mobil of the unit wa mainli march and run thi combat form wa no differ in natur than the war against the japanes or the civil war it could not even be compar to the korean war of the 1950 s under these condit the number of troop and the us of tactic were the kei decis factor howev at that time the indian lost on both these count so thei paid the price what then will he next war be like peopl who understand the world militari develop over the last 30 year will all reach the follow conclus the next war between china and india will be an air and land integr war fought under condit of a nuclear threat the so call air and land integr warfar is a joint battl conduct by all branch and forc of the militari it is a primari type of modern militari action the branch of the militari usual take part in the combat ar the air forc armi second artilleri missil unit and the type of forc ar the infantri armor artilleri commun engin chemic defens paratroop and special forc base on the geograph condit of the combat area the branch and forc thrown into combat by both side will be differ for instanc the border area of india is high plateau and mountain so there will commonli be us air forc infantri artilleri paratroop and engin while it is difficult to make the best of the king of ground battl the tank in that type of terrain howev in more open area deep in either side the armor forc might becom primari assault forc both side ar nuclear power so while fight a convent war the nuclear threat of the other side can never be elimin thi is on of the major characterist of modern warfar it is veri obviou that both the chines and the indian have the capabl to conduct air and land integr three dimension warfar in addit to the composit of their forc both side have the variou branch and type of forc in their strategi thei have both absorb the essenc of the great depth theori and the unit state militari air and land integr combat theori into their campaign theori thei have also long been us it in joint militari train and in campaign exercis it is not difficult for us to suppos that in the next battl which might occur on the roof of the world there would appear variou type of weapon and forc in the air the air battl which will primarili be fought with such second and third gener aircraft as the f 8 ii f 10 mig 29 su 27 f l6 and mirag 2000 aircraft will be a dazzl engag also the b 6 and jaguar high altitud bomber and fighter bomber will be respons for conduct firepow assault on target deep in enemi territori the short and medium rang missil and paratroop forc will becom the primari forc for attack fortif and major target deep in enemi territori the air over the battlefield will be fill with high power multipl frequenc band radio wave to deal a fatal soft kill to the enemi on the ground new larg calib self propel gun and multipl barrel rocket gun such as the 152 mm self propel cannon the 206 mm self propel mortar the 130 mm self propel rocket gun will plai a major role in suppress firepow flock of armor helicopt will becom the nemesi of close attack surfac target model 80 and t 72 main battl tank will be respons for defens in depth and for carri out high speed penetr engin with such advanc equip as rocket mine lai vehicl will quickli be abl to erect obstacl against the attack enemi infantri forc will all us highli accur rapid fire light univers automat weapon thei will also be equip with on man anti tank missil recoilless rifl mortar and night vision devic we can see from the primari us of the weapon describ abov that the space taken up by the battlefield in a futur war between china and india will be mani time larger perhap as much as ten time larger and the concentr of firepow and the destruct power will be as much as 100 time greater the switch back and forth from offens to defens will also be more rapid battlefield postur will chang in an instant whichev side is victori the cost will be tremend and tragic it is just that the winner will receiv some sort of compens and the loser will lose ani possibl of compens to sum it all up the next war between china and india will not be an easi matter for either side when might a war between china and india break out doe india have the capabl at the present time to launch an attack in depth local in china s tibet and xinjiang is it as some scholar maintain that face with the tremend threat from india that china mai have perman lost suzerainti over some of it territori on the surfac the situat seem to have reach a crisi and reach a stage where we have to fight howev deeper analysi indic that the situat is still far from such a stage as everyon know in both the past and present anyon who press the button of war will have to pai the price furthermor thi tremend cost will undoubtedli be a burden pass on to the peopl of that countri it is veri clear that india doe not yet have the capabl of pai that price in the process of carri out their expansionist polici the indian author ar actual face a number of factor and obstacl which ar keep them from do as thei wish the first of these is their econom strait if it can be state that at the present time india s militari forc ar compar with china s then in overal nation strength especi in econom competit india ha been left far behind by china about 20 year behind in agricultur from 1986 to 1992 india s grain product ha increas at an annual rate of 2 4 percent if we take annual grain product to be three percent and annual popul increas to be two percent then it will take at least 20 year for india to reach the level of 362 kilogram of grain per person per year in june 1991 india s foreign reserv were onli about 1 billion onli enough for two week import foreign debt howev wa more than 70 billion it take 30 percent of the incom from export to pai the capit and interest on thi debt thei have a trade deficit of as much 5 billion the grim econom situat ha forc the indian govern to concentr it main energi on improv the economi and work to reform the economi howev from the degre and effect of the reform the dispar between china and india will continu to grow at the end of 1991 china had alreadi accumul in 120 billion worth of foreign exchang sinc 1984 india onli had a total of less than 1 billion it is clear how difficult the step of reform ar for india therefor for a fairli long time for the next 15 to 20 year india s overal nation strength will not be abl to compet with that of china next is strateg pressur in the strateg postur of south asia india is caught between china and pakistan it is in a disadvantag posit of face two front on on the east and on on the west pakistan reli on support from china for it secur and china also hope that pakistan will restrain india therefor after the breakdown of the soviet union india s strateg intent ar to maintain militari superior and suffici pressur over pakistan and a defens against china in 1991 india deploi four armi 10 infantri divis and an addit armor divis 15 mechan divis and on infantri divis to the india pakistan border at kashmir to be respons for strateg mobil against pakistan on third of it air forc ar also deploi against pakistan along the border with china howev there is on infantri divis and on air wing on the western sector on the eastern sector there ar two mountain divis and a small amount of air forc natur thi is not to sai that india see pakistan strateg as it primari enemi but that it indic that under pressur from differ side india wa forc to adopt it current transit deploy therefor with india s current strateg deploy be what it is india doe not have the capabl of launch an attack on china also to achiev it naval strategi indian forc have alreadi us their primari financi resourc on equip for their navi and air forc allow for a rapid increas in it naval combat threat and basic establish india in the posit as king of the indian ocean howev a war between china and india would be primarili fought on the ground it will be veri difficult for india to take ani advantag of it naval superior and india doe not have ani clear superior over china in ground warfar capabl should war break out the indian forc ar not veri confid of win we can imagin from thi that in the next ten year or so it is not veri like that a local war of ani larg scale will break out between china and india the first ten year of the next centuri will be a more danger period what kind of attack could the indian forc launch the caus of ani border conflict between india and china would be the direct result of the territori disput there will not be ani major chang on thi point for quit some time to come could the tibetan problem which ha attract so much attent becom a critic junctur thi is not a remot possibl after thei split off india ha been the onli countri on which the tibetan splittist element could depend for the indian support of the tibetan splittist could have even more benefit so thei ar happi to do it in addit to these two possibl ani greedi attempt would be overstep on s bound from the angl of the indian author and an analysi base on gener combat principl of modern limit war theori india s combat object can be determin to be the destruct of major target on the tibetan border and the chines defens system so the chines forc would be unabl to pose a threat to attack india thu establish clear militari superior within the indo chines border area thi would both be both an advantag and realist combat object it focu is on attack the vital forc of the chines militari and not on occup in thi manner after the attack ha achiev it effect the forc would withdraw from combat veri quickli to avoid fall into a quagmir of prolong combat also thei would not be burden with occupi territori unless the valu of the territori wa worth the price of the fight when the chines forc had onc more assembl in tibet and pose a threat to the border area and influenc the superior posit of the indian forc thei would launch anoth attack thi is call a pugilist strategi it will becom india s fundament kei in the next war base on the strategi and tactic mention abov india will have to throw at least four to five mountain infantri divis more than two artilleri divis two to three tank divis on to two airborn divis and 500 combat aircraft into the battl total around 200 000 men it will natur also requir larg number of medium and close rang missil and ground to air missil what will be the result of the chines counterattack for possibl counterattack against the indian forc some of the chines forc station in tibet and xinjiang will be far from enough therefor within a number of week the chines militari will deploi two or more group armi to tibet and southern xinjiang us current mobil capabl it will take at least three week to complet emerg defens deploy howev it could first deploi on or two rapid reaction divis along the primari axi to stop the indian advanc by the time the indian forc have complet prepar for assault it is estim that the chines militari could assembl 80 000 to 100 000 men in tibet and southern xinjiang as well as more than 400 fighter long rang bomber mai be deploi in the interior for direct support of combat zone in tibet even if the chines forc ar outnumb concentr the forc along the primari axi of attack will at least allow them to hold their own for a period of time provid more time for reinforc unit clearli focuss on the strateg intent and combat characterist of the indian forc the chines forc will defens concentr on prevent the indian forc from break through deeper into chines territori and maintain major defens posit on the front line and deeper back forc the indian forc to fight in area south of the border howev if the main forc is deploi on the border front line not onli will it be difficult to support them there but thei could easili be surround and wipe out by the indian forc therefor the major foothold of chines forc in their defens combat should be mobil attack defens and not posit defens that is along the main axi of attack by the indian forc to form an echelon deploy and when the indian forc break through a short distanc into our territori we should attack their flank or rear follow up unit and encircl and wipe them out befor the indian forc have a chanc to gain a foothold the central factor which will determin the defens and counterattack capabl of the chines forc will not be the number of men or the strength of the forc but will be whether or not constant suppli can be ensur similarli the indian forc will make attack the chines rear suppli base and suppli line their primari object most of the suppli to unit station in tibet travel over the sichuan tibet road or the qinghai tibet road with some be air lift troop materi and weapon all follow these three transport rout should these rout be cut off the unit in tibet would be in dire strait in the earli stage of the war as the surfac forc becom engag along the border the indian air forc and missil forc will launch a firepow assault on transport rout and primari airfield and base in the rear in order to prevent the chines strateg mobil forc from assembl and to allow the indian airborn assault forc and tank forc to go through breach in the front line and quickli penetr and encircl major strongpoint in the rear the chines forc in their defens posit mai ensur the major strongpoint and suppli rout in the rear at the cost of lose front line posit the offens and defens fight at thi stage will primarili be fought in the air in an attempt to gain control of the air judg from the current strength of the air forc of both side the indian forc have more than 700 combat aircraft most of which ar second gener primari combat aircraft with a small number of third gener primari combat aircraft but thei have superior in fighter and earli warn and command the chines have as mani as 4 000 combat aircraft with an even smaller proport of third gener aircraft thei have superior in bomber and total number of aircraft if war should break out and there is no chang in thi ratio then the chines forc would have to sacrific number in exchang for control of the air in thi manner the earli stage of the war would center around the struggl over control of the air and it would be a bitter and prolong struggl there would also be addit loss among the chines ground forc onli after the chines had gain control of the air would there be ani possibl of the chines forc be abl to organ for a strateg counterattack and the first stage would then be finish in the earli stage of the war the ground forc on both side might launch attack in area 50 to 100 kilomet insid tibet becaus the indian would have lost control of the air in order to ensur the air secur of it ground forc the indian forc will primarili us surfac to air missil for an air defens umbrella howev the artilleri tank and helicopt would be primarili respons for conduct firepow assault on the ground dure thi period whether or not the chines ground forc respons for hold the major strongpoint behind the front line would be abl to hold back the indian attack and gain time for the strateg counterattack is the kei to overal victori or defeat as is illustr in the forego descript of the infantri firepow of both side we can see that china ha as a slight superior especi in artilleri where the chines ar not onli superior to the indian in technolog but in number as well therefor the chines ar fairli confid in the abil of their forc to defend stronghold behind the front line as well as make prepar for the strateg counterattack attent must be paid to the fact that dure their attack the indian forc will place a great deal of stress and possibl even too much relianc on firepow and in addit to conduct a great deal of firepow prepar there must be strong firepow support dure the entir attack should the firepow cover ever be cut off the attack would come to a halt convers for the chines forc the most import mission in smash the indian attack would be to destroi the heavi firepow weapon and forc provid cover such as tank helicopt gunship support artilleri and heavi machin gun therefor the chines ground forc must have suffici on man anti tank missil and surfac to air missil in addit to their current inventori as well as advanc person night vision devic to enhanc their night fight capabl in the later stage of the fight it will be up to the final strateg counterattack to complet crush the indian assault when the chines forc successfulli assembl a forc sever time that of the indian forc and have a firm hold on air domin the time will be ripe for the strateg counterattack at thi time the chines forc will have two option the first option will be to break through the indian frontal assault with the goal of rout the indian forc the second option will be to conduct a thrust or airborn action behind indian line includ target in india itself and wipe out indian forc there clearli the second option fall in line with common combat principl but the greatest danger is that it might lead to an escal of the war whatev the choic it must be made consid the situat at the time furthermor on point is veri clear the final object of the strateg counterattack will to be to end the abil of the indian forc to pose a threat to china and to make the indian author abandon their territori demand against china as for the number of enemi kill thi is onli on condit necessari for achiev the strateg goal how excel ar forc which can conquer without fight in order to achiev the element of surpris in the counterattack and in order to achiev a rapid end to the fight the airborn action will be coordin with the attack on the front thi is a major tactic of counterattack by the chines armi if the crack indian divis ar surround and wipe out or suffer seriou casualti the situat will chang veri quickli if the strateg counterattack is fought off by the indian forc the war will becom mire down in a prolong standoff invis superior cannot be ignor it must be ad that in space technolog the chines enjoi a clear superior and thei mai alwai have thi superior india s space technolog began in 1957 and while it ha develop rapidli over the ensu 30 plu year it carrier rocket technolog and it launch capabl ar still no match for china s for exampl india had onli directli or indirectli launch l0 satellit by the end of 1989 onli two of these ar still oper normal the other eight have alreadi becom useless either becaus of malfunct or have reach the end of their time limit it will take at least to the end of thi centuri or the begin of the next centuri for india to reach china s current level of space technolog by that time china will alreadi have begun to develop a space shuttl the war in the persian gulf ha made it clear that space technolog ha an import influenc on war at the time in order to monitor everi move by iraq and to determin the locat of major target the unit state borrow a number of satellit such as big bird lock ey and hockei ball to provid the air forc and surfac forc detail intellig inform and so that iraq wa almost complet expos to the ey of the multin forc we can see from thi that in a war between china and india superior in space technolog will allow the chines forc to be more effect and more precis in their forc deploy axi of attack and firepow in summat can the chines forc repeat their glori of 1962 can thei win a counterattack battl with india under modern condit the answer is affirm it is onli that thei will have to pai a higher price than in 1962 it must be stress that the consist stand of the chines govern ha alwai been that it will not make chang becaus it forc have becom stronger that it will primarili us peac mean for a polit settlement to resolv the territori disput the chines govern ha never provok an arm conflict last year premier li peng visit india indic that relat between china and india were move toward a new stage thi illustr the chines govern s honest intent to activ develop friendli and cooper relat with it border countri it make the statement to everi chines soldier that war is a choic made onli when it is forc upon us and that best strategi is for a peac resolut of territori disput v how to cope with the threat from the north on a cold winter dai 23 year ago on the frozen ic of the usuri river there wa an engag between chines border defens forc and soviet border defens forc with a wide dispar in the size of forc the chines forc which had never seen a t 62 new model tank reli on their spirit to fight for the territori integr of the motherland us 82 mm recoilless rifl 40 mm rocket launcher infantri anti tank mine in a life and death struggl with the soviet forc although at the cost of over 100 live thei fought back the soviet provoc and captur a t 62 tank the valu of thi tank is fulli manifest in the later tank develop in the chines forc at the time while the soviet gener staff wa at a loss about what to do to get back the tank which had been damag more startl new came in dure the assault sever dozen border defens soldier had frozen to death in the snow follow a detail investig thei select three divis at random for an experi in the snow thei quickli came to the conclus that the reason these troop had frozen to death wa that thei had had no train on sleep outsid in below zero temperatur fortun sever regular combat divis were unabl to reach the area by the time of the attack or els even if the fight had not escal the number of non combat casualti would have reach four digit both side gain someth and lost someth in thi fight sever month later there wa anoth clash between chines border defens forc and soviet forc in the northwest border region of xinjiang thi time the soviet place almost an entir battalion of regular combat element into the battl not border defens forc the result wa the death of an entir compani of chines border defens forc thi is from offici record there ar some unoffici record which ar rumor and specul which state that after thi clash in xinjiang the soviet forc intensifi their forc and the forc break into xinjiang territori reach an entir mechan divis howev thei were surpris by a huge mushroom shape cloud which came down on their head after thi the chines govern announc that an atom bomb had been successfulli explod in western china there wa noth the soviet author could sai whether offici record or unoffici record it seem like it wa onli yesterdai that it happen the adversari is still our older brother even while the former soviet union wa in ascend china s forc were never realli afraid of thi militari monster thi is the tempera of the chines peopl never bow down to ani outsid pressur therefor dure the more than 20 year from the deterior of relat between china and the soviet union to the break up of the soviet union there were major forc face each other across the chines soviet border readi to fight at the touch of a button at that time the soviet had deploi on quarter of their combat unit along their far east border with china and china deploi 75 percent of it forc to defend it northern border although larg scale arm conflict or war never broke out both side paid a tremend price for maintain a combat readi system and militari balanc to be abl to fight earli fight a larg scale war and fight a nuclear war from convent ammunit alon it is possibl to see the overal situat onc china s vast militari industri product system had been turn up to high product to prepar for war with the soviet forc in a veri short time of a few year it allow the 7 62 mm ammunit variou type of anti tank rocket ammunit and bomb reserv of the chines militari to reach a level where there wa enough to fight a medium scale war there wa more 7 62 mm ammunit alon than could be us in 10 year thi wa a price to pai natur compar to the soviet union the chines paid a much smaller price todai the soviet union ha been dismemb and the cold war is over howev the greatest potenti threat to china still come from the north the basic reason for thi is that the russian have inherit almost 80 percent of the militari strength of the former soviet union it is still the second strongest of the foremost militari power in the world furthermor the russian have a histori of chauvin thei ar peopl with a strong expansionist natur thei will not be happi to be a second class militari power in addit russia and china have histor had border disput so just the exist of russia alon is a great threat the russian ar in the difficult posit of intern struggl and econom strait thei ar activ promot peac diplomaci and the militari forc ar undergo a larg scale reduct it look as if thei ar noth to be afraid of howev when thei ar through thi crisi and have escap form the difficult condit thei will begin recoveri it is hard to tell what the situat will be for china the threat from the north underw a basic chang with the breakup of the soviet union in addit to russia there ar also mongolia and kazakhstan mongolia ha a long land border with china it also abut inner mongolia in januari 1992 the second session of the 12th mongolian peopl congress pass a new constitut chang the name of the mongolian peopl republ to mongolia the reason wa primarili that mongolia ha a 2 200 year histori count the 785 year from the found of mongolia by genghi khan to the present dai and of these 785 year the name of the countri wa mongolia for 718 year the name mongolian peopl republ is onli 67 year old we can see from thi that mongolia ha begun it advanc toward it goal of greater mongolia such a result would directli lead to rip inner mongolia from the map of china militarili mongolia is still no match for china on it own there ar onli 24 500 mongolian soldier it ha 21 000 men in the armi with 650 tank 135 armor reconnaiss vehicl 520 infantri combat vehicl 450 armor transport vehicl 750 field piec of variou model 100 anti aircraft gun and 300 item of surfac to air missil equip there ar 3 500 men in the air forc with more than 30 fighter 41 transport and at least 10 helicopt obvious mongolia can onli be consid to be a piddl countri therefor the onli wai it can achiev it goal of a greater mongolia is through stir up sentiment for a racial divis kazakhstan ha alreadi had border territori disput with china most of what wa onc the western sector of the sino soviet border is now the sino kazakh border which is more than 1 600 kilomet long in octob 1991 the kazakhstan premier state while talk of the sino soviet border disput the wai i see it these land were hand down to us gener after gener we must not cede a singl inch to ani outsid begin in the summer of 1991 the local govern of the republ of kazakhstan for the purpos of develop the economi on on hand and protect nation border on the other organ the herdsmen to go the border to graze their herd there disput graze facil built in the area serious disrupt the situat along the sino kazakh border and attract the close scrutini of the chines govern ly within the republ of kazakhstan is the eastern border defens militari district subordin to the former soviet union nation secur council and task with the respons for secur on the chines border the republ of kazakhstan doe not current have the abil to build an armi of it own so on on hand it is call for keep a unifi arm border forc within the independ nation and on the other hand is also call for common control over the unifi arm border forc we can see from thi that thi eastern border defens district could veri possibl becom the basi for the kazakhstani to build their own armi both mongolia and kazakhstan could caus troubl for china but neither is capabl of do anyth militarili the real threat is russia ar the russian forc as frighten as thei ar said to be russia s militari might is current second in the world thi point is not to be doubt howev occasion there ar a number of articl describ the russian forc which miss the mark in quit a number of wai in these articl there is quit a bit of deliber make them seem better than thei realli ar as for those who like to glorifi data and us the name of weapon to scare peopl if we had them go try to take on the russian thei would be defeat and never know what had happen to them the armi of the former soviet union began in the thirti to us the invis divis type of structur thi system save the soviet union allow it to escap defeat in world war ii thei still us thi system at the begin of world war ii on of the major error of the german high command wa in it calcul of the number of soviet combat divis thei had no understand at all of the soviet second forc therefor thei calcul 182 divis accord to the soviet union s convent militari establish while the soviet union actual had 303 divis as a result the german forc becam mire down in a situat where the more we fight the soviet red armi the more of them there ar the so call divis system is a doubl man system each divis command ha two deputi divis command under him on of these deputi command ha a secret titl command of the second unit each regiment battalion and compani work the same wai in thi manner when get readi for war on divis can becom two divis overnight similarli dure the cold war the soviet union successfulli us a seri of trick and decept to cover up it own weak and make it imposs for the unit state to determin what wa real and what wa not dure the cuban crisi khrushchev made the threat that with the push of a singl button capit will be blown to bit when he made thi statement howev the soviet rocket still had a major defect the guidanc system wa complet unreli and could not be deploi when the unit state began to deploi an anti missil system the soviet union had not consid thi yet but in a militari parad the soviet territori defens forc displai a huge rocket make peopl believ it wa an anti missil missil actual thi rocket should have been with the strateg rocket forc there ar ani number of such decept there is a strateg decept bureau in the soviet armi whose function is to fabric decept for secur requir it ha almost unlimit author it receiv it order from nowher but the kremlin the misconcept it creat last not for a few hour but for a few year for decad earli in the 1980 s a young german name lewster flew a small civilian plane through the air defens network of the warsaw pact with no problem at all and safe land at the airport in moscow thi not onli shock the author in the former soviet union but also amaz the rest of the world what had happen to the russian air defens system not long after that the soviet had announc that the soviet minist of defens had been fire thi actual illustr that there were frighten hole in the soviet union s air defens system in a larg scale exercis call lightn in 1989 the battalion command of a motor battalion in the soviet armi wa reliev on the spot the reason is silli and unbeliev after thi battalion command receiv order to advanc toward the assembl area he did not take immedi action but conven a battalion meet to take a hand vote to see at exactli what time thei should begin the advanc as a result that battalion wa two hour arriv at the assembl area thi incid to a certain degre reveal the problem in qualiti of some soviet offic and problem with effici of militari command as for weapon and equip the weapon of the variou forc of the soviet militari have been far inferior to the american for a long time a small number of convent weapon were not even as good as china s follow the war in the persian gulf china tackl the technolog concern a stealth bomber and veri quickli came out with her own model thi is someth the russian have never figur out on the other hand becaus of econom difficulti a number of piec of equip thei have been abl to develop thei have not been abl to produc or us to equip the unit for exampl the yak 141 superson vtol interceptor which is best in the world ha been cancel from the plan becaus of the poor economi the su 37 interceptor wa onli abl to go into product after foreign cooper becaus of the shortag of spare part the air forc tu 22 bomber ha a readi rate of onli 30 to 40 percent some have been ground for more than six month from the late 1980 s to the earli 1990 s china enjoi quit a few benefit in it flexibl foreign polici it wa abl to obtain advanc technolog from the west and coupl with low cost weapon from the russian thei found it possibl to upgrad the weapon and equip of the chines forc into the next gener current the chines militari forc ar grasp the favor opportun when russia ha not yet recov to acceler the pace of advanc to next gener weapon and equip strive to reduc the degre by which it lag behind major militari power as quickli as possibl anoth factor worth note is the seriou amount of talent flow from the soviet union thi could have a fatal influenc on futur defens develop in russia sinc the breakup of the former soviet union more than 70 000 top expert and technician have alreadi left the countri includ 30 000 to the unit state 30 000 to israel 4 000 to germani and 6 000 to franc these expert ar a larg part of the militari s top technic peopl recent the unit state strateg defens plan agenc drew up a plan to obtain as quickli as possibl the scientif and technic personnel conduct the missil defens plan for the former soviet union japan korea taiwan and libya ar all do all thei can to obtain scientist and technician from the former soviet union we can see that becaus of polit and econom difficulti the flow of talent out of russia is continu thi will undoubtedli have a dampen effect on russian militari develop which wa not so great to start with it mai be believ that it will almost be imposs for the russian to recaptur their dream of be a militari superpow increasingli less pressur on beij dure the time of the sino soviet confront there were a total of about 40 divis of soviet forc in the border region with china call the million man armi at that time china estim that there were nine ax along which the soviet forc might break through the on that worri china the most wa a breakthrough along the china mongolia railroad where thei would threaten china s heart beij thi wa becaus at the time the soviet had as mani as 180 000 troop station in mongolia constitut a direct threat to beij in 1981 the largest scale live exercis in the histori of it armi wa conduct in north china thi exercis wa conduct with thi strateg thought in mind the area select for the exercis wa zhangjiak northwest of beij the exercis campaign wa a campaign counterattack against a soviet tank divis and mechan infantri forc which had broken through insid chines territori in the exercis thei design firepow assault against temporari fortif of concentr tank and mechan infantri and infantri forc follow tank and combat vehicl on an assault on the enemi in makeshift defens thei train in coordin combat between air forc airborn forc artilleri forc and infantri forc thi larg scale militari exercis reflect the concern of the chines over a soviet attack on beij follow the breakup of the former soviet union all of the soviet forc in mongolia withdrew and on of the hidden danger along the sino mongolian border wa elimin it wa as if beij had been freed of a heavi burden there were also major chang in the nine possibl ax of breakthrough of the soviet forc into china given the current statu of the russian militari it doe not constitut a direct militari pressur on china the primari reason for thi is that china s strategi ha not constitut a direct threat to russia and correspondingli russia s strateg direct is not for the time be aim at china secondli the russian arm forc ar current undergo major restructur and reform and it peripher form ar veri complex in addit to maintain an alert to the west it also want to prevent the rise of the ukrain as a polit forc from strateg consider the guid philosophi of the russian in build their armi is limit suffici increas it rapid reaction capabl to effect resolv region conflict therefor it will continu to reduc in total number it strateg militari weapon and it convent unit while maintain a highli effect and highli capabl strateg mobil forc in strateg deploy the far east region will not be weaken howev the primari oppon will no longer be china alon but will be a number of countri includ the unit state japan and korea and china it primari defens forc will be reduc in the western and central portion of russia itself it combat strategi is be capabl of war outsid the countri ensur territori secur in view of the situat describ abov at the present time it is veri difficult to predict what kind of war on what kind of scale along what kind of axi and in what area the russian militari might launch against china view from the present situat china s northeast is the primari sector where the two forc ar face each other the largest and best equip militari region of both side lie on either side of the border the russian have their far east militari district with 22 mechan divis two tank divis two artilleri divis on airborn brigad on campaign tactic rocket brigad and 585 combat aircraft the chines have the shenyang militari region which ha more men tank armor vehicl artilleri of variou type and it air forc more combat aircraft than ani other of china s militari region therefor the possibl of a futur arm conflict or local war between china and russia is greatest for thi region what will we us to resist the iron forc of the russian it is veri difficult to imagin a futur war between china and russia thi is becaus of the multitud of changeabl factor between these two countri and the chang ar veri rapid such as weapon upgrad chang in combat concept us of new tactic influenc of polit and diplomat method all of these could caus the situat to chang into someth complet differ or the revers might be true howev when we place the object of our imagin outsid of specif command warfar it becom of more practic valu a war between china and russia would be a three dimension war with coordin between all forc with ground combat the primari method there doe not seem to be much dissent with thi point howev the import question is whether such a war between two nuclear power would be fought without nuclear weapon it is usual judg that the possibl of a nuclear war between two countri is extrem small or nonexist although both countri lie within the nuclear strike zone of the other side each ha the capabl of conduct destruct nuclear retali howev the consequ of a major nuclear war would be destroi the enemi and destroi oneself as well howev thi cannot elimin the possibl of a nuclear shadow cast it pall over a convent war there ar two promin factor on is the possibl that the soviet forc could us tactic nuclear weapon to creat a breach in our defens the second is the us of tactic nuclear weapon to stop an assault by the first echelon unit or echelon format which ar attack defens in depth thi is a method which the chines forc could possibl us especi on it own territori natur the chines govern ha state time and again that it would never be the first to us nuclear weapon under ani condit in other word if the russian do not us nuclear weapon in their attack the chines forc would not break their promis we can reach a basic conclus form all of thi neither the chines nor the russian had better push the nuclear button but the nuclear trump card ha not lost it deterr role in a modern war primarili fought on the ground the russian trump card would obvious be the king of the land battl the tank the russian not onli have more tank than the unit state total almost 50 000 but thei ar lead edg tank the area where a war between china and russia could break out just happen to be the wide open space of the northeast plain thi is where the tank could realli show their stuff in number or qualiti of tank china is number three in the world after russia and the unit state howev in the next five year it will be veri difficult to surpass the russian therefor the veri acut question face the chines militari is what can we us to hold back thi iron wave of the russian forc the reason the russian attack is describ us the term iron wave is that after world war ii concentr of tank to break through defens and for high speed penetr ha been the univers adopt method of attack of all countri the militari forc of the former soviet union have almost redefin the us of concentr of tank to an art their famou campaign theori of great depth wide front and the variou campaign and tactic principl relat to thi ar all base on the us of concentr of tank even though the surviv of tank is serious challeng in a ground war under modern condit under condit of coordin combat of all forc there is still noth which can replac the breakthrough capabl of concentr of tank also for a fairli long time the russian militari ha been unabl to gradual move to primarili aerial breakthrough as have the american thei primarili reli on the famili of tank left over from the former soviet union to fight primarili a ground assault with thi precondit it is not difficult to imagin that when the russian forc launch a sudden attack into china the chines defens forc station in hilli and flat region will be face a high speed attack by hundr and thousand of tank furthermor prior to thi tank assault thei will have to withstand 40 to 60 minut of aerial missil and collect artilleri bombard the entir battlefield will be a wall of fire everyth will be torn up and tank and armor vehicl as thick as ant line up in combat format will come rumbl forward in a cloud of dust there could also be swarm of helicopt cover the sky thi is what the russian attack would look like and it is not an exagger natur how to resist attack by concentr of tank is not a new problem for the chines militari from the late 1960 s to the 1980 s the chines forc have been do research take the forc of the former soviet union as their primari adversari thei have conduct a great deal of research and mani exercis for battl against their primari breakthrough method of concentr of tank thei have made fairli thorough prepar for actual combat and combat zone construct especi research in multipl forc resist of an enemi attack by concentr of tank under condit of inferior equip it can be said that it ha been veri effect under the guid philosophi of dig hole deep store grain everywher never seek hegemoni in the 1960 s and 1970 s the chines forc construct larg amount of perman defens fortif so thei would alwai be readi to fight an earli war fight a larg war fight a nuclear war along the axi of possibl soviet invas these fortif ar alreadi there to be us to resist an armi of russian tank some peopl believ that when an infantri divis can hold off a tank divis then a stabl defens structur can be construct with strong fore not be too strong and weak forc not be too weak so both side will be equal on the battlefield thi view is not unreason and actual the chines forc alreadi have thi type of capabl it is just that it is not just a pure infantri divis fight in actual combat there is also no such thing as an attack by a pure tank divis but is a joint forc coordin combat what then ar the present and futur technic and tactic mean with which the chines forc can hold off an attack by concentr of tank for offens weapon the variou type of anti tank missil ar the most effect and the most threaten killer current the chines forc not onli have anti tank missil detach univers assign throughout their infantri forc but the armi air forc also have air to surfac anti tank missil second the chines forc have suffici number of tank and armor combat vehicl which ar less than first rate and quit a few which ar first rate in a defens war tank and armor vehicl posit in hidden locat will pose a threat to advanc enemi tank which is second onli to anti tank missil becaus tank to tank effect is on to on third ar helicopt and attack aircraft normal the most effect weapon against tank ar aerial weapon which attack the top of the tank which offer a larg target and a high hit rate also the armor is weaker on top howev without air superior it is difficult to bring these weapon into plai and china doe not have helicopt and attack aircraft in the number and qualiti of the two previou type of anti tank weapon fourth is to bring the variou type of anti tank artilleri into plai in addit to the heavi suppress gun the artilleri piec which can be us directli against tank ar the 85 mm gun the 82 mm recoilless rifl and the 105 mm recoilless rifl fifth is the infantri on man rocket launcher in close rang combat the on man rocket launcher is a great threat to tank non onli ar there larg number of these weapon but thei ar easili carri and can often deal a fatal blow from a blind spot outsid of the tank s vision larg mine field made up of variou type of anti tank mine ar primari defens weapon and tactic which restrict the movement of enemi tank the chines forc current possess all type of anti tank mine thei also have high speed mine lai method such as rocket mine lai and aerial mine lai method us in conjunct with mine field construct includ such obstacl as anti tank trench dragon s teeth and abati along the primari defens ax a mix obstacl area is usual set up which is more than 50 meter wide and more than 200 meter deep on plain defens battl at the regiment scale and higher a larg scale anti tank network of defens posit ar usual construct and combin with the obstacl zone to form a singl area 2 000 to 3 000 meter wide and 1 500 to 2 000 meter deep in the posit there is a criss cross pattern of trench with mine field scatter throughout in addit these ar variou type of fix obstacl form a complex variabl network defens system thi provid ideal conceal mobil and fire posit for the variou anti tank weapon when tank enter them it is veri difficult for them to move it is difficult for them to protect their flank and it is difficult to protect against attack from everi direct thi type of network defens system also make it possibl for individu soldier to attack tank becaus the mobil of the tank is limit and becaus thei have to keep move later and turn the infantri forc scamper through all the tunnel can us magnet mine demolit and explos charg against the tank and can even conduct an assault against the tank make it imposs for the tank to defend themselv as for tactic the chines forc will ordinarili intercept advanc enemi tank along the primari axi of attack by conduct long rang intermedi rang and close rang firepow blockad when the tank have advanc to within 40 kilomet and ar mass the attach defens artilleri group and armi airborn unit will conduct firepow harass against the tank when the tank have enter the 3 000 meter sector and deploi the anti tank missil and direct aim artilleri piec will begin fire at the same time suppress gun will conduct a firepow assault try to disrupt the tank format when the tank have advanc to within 1 000 meter and have begun to fire on the defens posit the intermedi and close rang anti tank firepow will switch over to fire at the second echelon tank forc at thi time the infantri forc and the other troop in the posit will be conceal and when the tank charg up to the obstacl zone 500 meter from the posit and the enemi suppress fire is extend to area insid the defens area the variou close rang anti tank weapon will all be thrown into the battl to prevent the enemi from chang direct the defens unit will usual have under their command a strong reserv consist of tank armor combat vehicl helicopt gunship and missil detach that can carri out high speed block action against the enemi axi of attack it must be strongli emphas that becaus the trend toward aerial modern ground combat ha alreadi begun and becaus the firepow assault mode of armi air forc plu concentr of tank ha alreadi been form the stabil of infantri ground defens ar determin by their abil to defend against aerial attack and the individu soldier s air defens weapon and posit air defens weapon ar crucial equip howev thi just happen to be a current weak of the chines ground forc the idea of an aggress defens must be carri out if russia throw on tank divis and two mechan infantri divis into combat in the first stage of it strateg attack it surfac assault strength would be around 500 combat vehicl and 30 000 combat personnel it would be unimagin to reli pure on a frontal defens against a high speed mobil combat forc with such strong firepow as thi the so call aggress defens refer to the need to conduct a strong assault on the enemi flank rear or second echelon forc at the same time as the frontal defens to quickli break up the enemi s assault when possibl we must surround and wipe out enemi forc that have broken through thi is what is known as a defens attack therefor while the chines forc ar carri out a frontal defens against the russian thei should prepar to launch a counterattack on the attack russian tank and mechan infantri forc thi mission is usual the respons of the campaign reserv under the control of the group armi there is a fairli wide choic of direct and method of campaign counterattack base on the deploy of the russian forc and the condit at the time the three follow situat at least must be consid first conduct a flank attack on the attack enemi wipe out it first echelon unit the chines campaign reserv will be mainli compos of tank and mechan infantri forc when the russian forc ar assault frontal defens the chines campaign reserv will began flank action against them when the chines suppress firepow is bombard the russian second echelon forc the reserv forc should launch a flank assault on the russian forc when the assault of russian first echelon unit ha been slow or stop in thi manner even if thei ar unabl to complet wipe out the russian first echelon unit thei will complet break up the russian s first assault the advantag of thi method ar that it break down the moral of the enemi it is easi to accomplish and chanc of success ar higher second conduct fairli larg scale attack on the russian rear forc so that the first and second echelon that have broken through can be surround and wipe out thi method requir twice as mani reserv and tank act as the primari forc for the penetr attack follow by mechan infantri forc it is possibl to have thi method evolv into a strateg counterattack when the situat permit us on to three divis of rapid reaction forc to launch an assault on posit deep within the russian far east militari region aim at the command center of the far east militari region thi would mean that the fire of war had reach russian soil if it is possibl to make the attack russian forc retreat quickli abandon their earliest strateg object it is also possibl that it would caus the russian forc to form an attack on an even larger scale third conduct an attack on the russian rear suppli facil larg scale tank battl requir larg amount of fuel to provid servic for the distant combat of the attack forc the russian forc would need to set up at least three field pipelin and on to two mobil suppli rout these would be the lifelin of the attack forc should thi be cut off by the chines forc the attack would be paralyz in an attack on the russian rear suppli rout the chines could us a larg number of forc and method air forc missil unit tank and armor assault forc and campaign artilleri group could all be us thi would be a tremend threat to the russian in addit to the form describ abov depend on the terrain condit of the combat zone the chines forc could also make an issu of the assault defens system deploi in advanc suffici forc on either side of the primari ax of the russian assault to form pocket defens in accomplish thi the kei problem is how to conceal thi from the russian reconnaiss and monitor system and how to mislead the russian in sum there ar a number of topic the chines can studi concern how to deal with larg russian tank forc howev as their equip and technic measur becom more and more modern the chines forc will becom even more confid of success vi can the three gorg project be protect the 900 mile of the three gorg 900 twist and turn 9 000 boat 990 000 net 90 000 new home 90 000 000 mu of orchard and 900 000 new resid sing beneath the bright sunni ski the boat float upon the water in the three gorg reservoir load with tangerin appl veget and pharmaceut there ha been anoth bounti harvest around the three gorg reservoir my friend when you hear thi song do you think about some of the event that came up while the idea of the three gorg wa discuss forti billion cubic meter of water hang over their head fourteen differ feasibl studi of the three gorg project stack on top of each other thei would be on meter high when the peopl s congress approv these report the vote wa not unanim at that time the report onli mention that of 412 expert 402 have sign thi report nine expert ar in opposit to thi report and have not sign it these nine expert who did not sign the report had suffici reason for their reserv thei could bring out pile after pile of detail report to make the expert who did sign the report feel that the pen thei sign with wa heavi inde there wa on reason that wa commonli held and which carri a great deal of weight thei would not be respons for hang the sword of damocl made up of 40 billion cubic meter of water over the head of the ten of million of peopl downstream on the chang jiang back in septemb of 1969 when the deputi chairman of the hubei provinci revolutionari committe zhang tixu onc more propos the three gorg project to chairman mao chairman mao point out we ar not now think about the three gorg we ar get readi for war he ask zhang tixu would you be afraid to have 20 billion cubic meter of water hang over your head doe thi statement mean that chairman mao wa oppos to the three gorg in 1956 he wrote in a poem build a rock wall will block the river in the west cut off the rain water from the mountain turn it into a lake the goddess should remain in good health and the world will be amaz the construct of the three gorg reservoir to bring prosper to all of the descend of the yellow emperor wa hi lifetim ambit similarli sever expert did not sign the feasibl report but thi wa not to oppos the build of the reservoir from 1959 until the report on the construct of the three gorg had been review and pass by the nation peopl s congress a span of 30 year research and test of air defens for the three gorg project continu unab it would make sens that militari expert would have the best reason to cast dissent vote howev professor yin zhishu deputi chairman for scienc and technolog of the gener staff engin command did sign the report he also continu scientif research and test for air defens of the three gorg project he said that he sign the report becaus sandoup wa select as the site for the dam and if the origin site nanjinguan had been select he would have refus to sign he said it wa extrem fortun that sandoup wa select from liantuo to nanjinguan there ar 20 kilomet of narrow gorg and there ar three 90 degre turn thi greatli reduc the peak flow at the dam when the reservoir is at it maximum water level of 175 meter if the dam should collaps and the water in the reservoir be releas the maximum water level at shashi would be 45 75 meter 1 25 meter below the top of the leve howev thi view of hi caus him to be critic by other in the militari thi is risk take do you realli think that an enemi would onli bomb your three gorg and would not bomb your leve thi is true at hi home the night befor he sign the report sever of hi old comrad in arm kept repeat what had happen in the past dure the 100 year from 1849 to 1949 there had been seven major flood on the chang jiang averag on everi 14 year there were especi larg flood in 1860 and 1870 there were major break in the levi of the xinjiang inund more than 30 counti and result in sever million death in the major flood in 1931 in the area of the middl reach of the river 50 9 million mu were cover and 145 000 peopl di hankou wa flood for an entir month boat sail in the street of the citi and the beij to hankou railroad wa wash out in the major flood in 1935 in a singl night in the middl and lower reach of the hanjiang 30 000 peopl were drown also 30 000 peopl were drown in the middl and lower reach of the lijiang the most unforgett flood wa in the summer of 1949 when their unit were be led south through hebei and hunan and came up against a major flood in the chang jiang thi flood wa compar to the flood in 1931 when more than 140 000 peopl drown the purpos of the reservoir wa to elimin flood disast but build the reservoir could possibl caus a flood disast it is true that there ar two side to everyth on favor and on unfavor the three gorg project will be after all a world class major reservoir cover l9 counti and citi in two provinc from sun yatsen to mao zedong from the nationalist to the communist from american hydraul engin expert safanqi 5646 0416 1142 to all the deced of the yellow emperor in china who ha not dream of dam up the three gorg who ha not dream of hold back the chang jiang to creat prosper for the peopl in choos between disadvantag and advantag the repres of the nation peopl s congress saw that the advantag outweigh the disadvantag and final pass the resolut to build the three gorg project the thing is when thei pass thi resolut thei place a tremend respons on the shoulder of the chines militari to protect the three gorg project thi respons concern the safeti of sever hundr million fellow countrymen it involv the overal growth of the nation it wa everi bit as critic as fight a local war the threat of futur war did not keep work from begin on the three gorg project neither did the begin of work on the three gorg project reduc the possibl of war the heavi respons of defend the three gorg dure wartim natur fell upon the shoulder of our soldier can the three gorg project be preserv in the event of a futur war where li the danger in the three gorg project onc work begin on the three gorg project it will necessarili becom a major strateg project in ani futur war therefor a seri of defens measur for the three gorg project will all have to be consid in term of strateg import becaus the three gorg project is locat in the interior and sinc it is a fix militari strateg target which is easili attack and difficult to defend defens will have to be passiv therefor the establish an infal defens system is a veri complic problem of system engin the decis to final begin work on the three gorg illustr that the chines have suffici confid and determin in it defens the militari is at least 70 to 80 percent confid otherwis thei would be plai game with the live of sever million peopl how a defens system for the three gorg project is to be establish ha natur becom a kei state secret we cannot describ it specif but from the public statement of a number of militari expert concern research report we can make a few approxim and guess when will the period of danger begin the three gorg project will last into the next centuri it will not be complet until the year 2008 thi is a span of 15 year but no on can sai for sure if china will be involv in a war in the next 15 year no on can sai what kind of chang will occur in the world militari struggl dure these 15 year china recent announc that the flow of water would begin to be cut off in 1997 that is to sai the period of danger will begin in 1997 cut off the flow will not caus the water level upstream to reach the maximum height of 175 meter but after the flow ha been cut off the water level will be suffici to constitut a threat downstream therefor the variou defens deploy should be basic complet in 1997 to deal with ani situat that might develop what kind of attack might be launch against the three gorg there ar mani differ method that could be us to attack the three gorg but an analysi of the result of an attack and the condit under which the assault would be launch show that there ar four major possibl method strateg nuclear warhead thi could be launch directli form the enemi s own soil and a direct attack by a singl warhead could achiev the object of destroi the dam if mirv warhead were us not onli would the probabl of a direct hit be greater but the capabl of break through defens would be greater it would be easili accomplish the risk of thi method is that it would be subject to intern pressur and nuclear retali by china convent missil these ar launch with better mobil ar easi to prepar have less effect and usual requir a number of missil to make direct hit to accomplish the object of break through defens aerial bombard thi is the us of long rang bomber group to conduct a bomb assault on the three gorg dam thi would be a reason move in a major war the hit rate would be much higher than for a bridg or build natur in the us of air forc the major difficulti would be solv the problem of air defens unlik the first two method bomber would be face attack by aerial combat and surfac firepow demolit thi is us crack special forc detach to perform destruct demolit on the three gorg dam sinc world war ii thi ha been a method easili imagin by militari strategist the most outstand advantag to thi method is that it is covert sudden and highli reliabl the disadvantag ar that it would be an extrem complex mission to organ it would take a fairli long time to conduct simul train and the technic requir would be veri high from current militari develop in countri around the world and their strateg relationship with china the countri that ar capabl of us the method of attack describ abov and that constitut a threat to the three gorg project ar the unit state japan russia and india thi is to sai that these countri ar the on the three gorg project must be protect against and that special deploy against the attack capabl of these nation must be conduct if we can defend against attack from these four nation then it would be an easi task to defend against other nation the first sky network anti missil missil defens system the object of futur local war will not be the three gorg the three gorg will howev be a primari target in futur region war sinc the three gorg project will be a major strateg target it strateg defens deploy must be place within the nation strateg defens system and it must not be an independ defens system the signific of thi is that thi network will not onli protect the three gorg but will also cover major citi along the chang jiang such as chengdu wuhan zhenzhou nanchang nanj and shanghai as well as such strateg center as sichuan yunnan guizhou hunan henan anhui zhejiang jiangxi fujian and guangdong a larg portion of china the primari mission of thi network will be to intercept outsid the atmospher ballist missil come from all direct it deploy will not requir a special adjust thi is becaus the deploy of china s anti missil missil is a mixtur of fix launch point and mobil launch point thei ar ground base or sea launch the second artilleri and the naval submarin forc ar respons for launch anti missil missil there ar current two major weapon which thei us the first is the cz ai anti missil missil it is much smaller than the changzheng i and the changzheng ii with which peopl ar familiar it is also much less expens but can be us for intercept insid and outsid the atmospher flight time is less than that of the galosh missil it ha cruis capabl and is equip with a rocket engin capabl of multipl start up and shut down after launch the engin is shut down and the missil glide while await further guidanc instruct then the engin is restart for power intercept second is the cz b 01 anti missil missil which began be deploi in the 1990 s thi is a termin intercept missil base on modif to the sz 12 surfac to air missil the missil is equip with a new high speed two aspect target track radar it ha superson intercept speed and can reach it target within five minut it is claim that the missil can destroi all type of icbm includ the us mx missil the kei to how well thi sky network will oper ar the reaction speed and precis of the system to improv the combat capabl of thi system the chines ar develop better radar plan to set up a larg combat command phase arrai radar in the area of the nanl mountain and will set up three phase arrai control radar in taian in shandong where the three provinc of zhejiang fujian and jiangxi come togeth in the huangl mountain and in the xichang area of sichuan thi system will be capabl of monitor and track trident missil launch from us submarin in the pacif to improv radar surviv thei will also activ develop mobil phase arrai radar the second sky network three dimension intercept within the atmospher in certain wai the second sky network is the kei to the defens system on reason for thi is china s current rel superior capabl for intercept within the atmospher and china s technolog and equip could easili meet strateg requir on the other hand there ar mani possibl mean of enemi attack within the atmospher and defens is more difficult therefor protect of air space within the atmospher is an extrem critic link defens system for insid the atmospher ar divid into high medium and low altitud defens high altitud refer to air space over 2 000 meter abov the earth medium refer to altitud between 500 and 2 000 meter and low refer to below 500 meter the forc primarili respons for thi defens mission ar the second artilleri the air forc the air forc surfac air defens forc and the armi air defens forc the primari weapon ar surfac to air missil f 7 f 8 and su 27 combat aircraft on man anti aircraft missil and variou type of anti aircraft artilleri and machin gun we can imagin that there will be a rel larg number and a complex mix of men and weapon compos the second sky network so a special deploy will be requir the basic principl of thi deploy will be a sequenti dispers deploy of the follow forc list in order of proxim to the three gorg dam ground forc air defens unit air forc air defens unit second artilleri unit and air forc aerial combat unit their mission will be as follow the second artilleri will be primarili respons for high altitud defens medium and low altitud defens will be the respons of the air forc and armi air defens unit it must be stress that militari throughout the world ar pai more and more attent to the role of surfac to air intercept missil the experi of the gulf war wa that advanc intercept missil ar the most effect air defens the technic level of the surfac to air missil with which chines unit ar now equip cannot yet meet defens requir exactli what kind of missil will be us militari expert have conduct conscienti research and test and from the standpoint of econom effect and feasibl thei believ that thei will opt for the soviet galosh intercept missil thi is a modif of the gelifeng 2706 6849 0023 intercept missil it us a two or three stage solid or liquid fuel rocket with greater power and higher rate of intercept it is capabl of high altitud intercept and it ha a much higher precis than rocket artilleri begin in 1964 four of these defens system were deploi around the perimet of the soviet union each defens system wa divid into two group and each group had eight intercept missil launcher for a total of 64 launcher on larg track radar and two intercept missil guidanc radar two of these were dismantl in 1982 and by 1988 becaus the sentinel intercept missil system ha been shut down the galosh is the onli anti missil system in the world with activ capabl thi sort of system in the area of the three gorg would not be much differ than the on in moscow it would be form of two defens system on each on the north and south bank each system would be compos of three launch group and each launch group would have nine launcher for a total of 54 launcher thi is suffici for a missil defens barrier in the area of the dam howev as a wartim strateg defens system it still ha some seriou shortcom primarili the follow three the nerv center of the sky network the shenzhou c sup 3 i system page 51 of origin miss land base non nuclear intercept missil includ 70 exospher re entri interceptor eri and 30 upper atmospher defens interceptor hedi us changzheng missil launch silo 2 monitor and track in addit to us current earli warn satellit and earli warn radar termin imag radar and three surfac transmiss surveil and track radar will be deploi 3 combat manag c sup 3 i thi will be compos of target earli warn center combat control center and commun center with earli warn satellit commun satellit and earli warn radar the defens system must be built in stage the overal defens system can be built in six stage as work progress on the three gorg dam the first step will be taken in 1994 thi will be the deploy of land base long rang intercept missil in conjunct with current earli warn sensor thi can be accomplish with current technolog capabl and will provid a certain prioriti defens and will also be abl to deal with accident launch third countri attack and terrorist attempt the second step will be taken in 1996 without violat the abm treati a new gener of air surveil system will be deploi to improv earli warn detect and identif capabl against a missil attack and to lai a foundat for futur defens system to handl larger scale and more complex attack at the same time a certain number of air forc and air defens unit will be deploi the third step will be taken in 1998 a system will be deploi to protect nation command author against a missil attack to includ a submarin launch missil attack it will includ the us of short rang interceptor and ought to emploi a multipl capabl surfac to air missil system which can be us against ballist missil cruis missil and bomber improv version of the shenzhou and changzheng anti missil missil ar candid for thi stage the fourth step will be taken in the year 2000 in thi stage the scale of the defens system will be expand and will includ addit anti missil missil launch site addit number of interceptor and improv sensor that will be abl to handl countermeasur all air forc and air defens unit will be in posit the fifth step will be taken in the year 2004 it will consist of the addit of space base interceptor to conduct boost stage and post boost stage intercept in the year 2008 when the three gorg project will be complet the sixth step will be taken thi will be the addit of space base and land base direct energi weapon while deploi the air defens system in addit to arm secur unit to protect the dam it will also be necessari to deploi two or three regiment of armi special forc to deal with ani intrus by group of enemi agent these step will basic meet the requir of a three dimension defens no defens is perfect imagin in a certain month of a certain year war final break out on the first dai missil swarm like bee our c sup 3 i system is total activ and the intercept rate is 99 percent the missil becom casualti of war explod in the atmospher the next dai the war suddenli cool down and electron puls blip appear on a number of radar screen on the third dai a long rang missil attack the dam it is recogn by almost none of the surveil system why did the c sup 3 i system becom block comput determin that the c sup 3 i system wa damag the reserv system is turn on it will not oper the emerg system is activ it will not oper either none of the three set of c sup 3 i reserv equip will oper why is thi thi is what could possibl happen in futur local war even now a number of militari power alreadi possess mean and capabl to deal with three dimension defens system thei all fall into the follow categori of high scienc and technolog 1 direct laser radiat from a satellit to damag all air defens electron equip the former soviet union began research on laser weapon in the earli 1960 s and it had a huge develop plan in the 1970 s it spent nine time as much as the unit state on high energi laser weapon total as much as 10 billion after the 1980 s it wa spend three to four time as much as the unit state as for the scope of the soviet laser weapon develop plan the american sigh to match the scale of the soviet laser weapon plan the unit state would have to spend about 1 billion per year the unit state ha alreadi set up more than eight larg develop plant and test site as well as 15 larg research center there ar more than 10 000 scientist engin and technician conduct laser weapon research oper at almost 30 facil most of their work is concentr at the missil test center in texa in addit thei have establish high power infrar laser experiment station in florida the northern and central appalachian mount ranier death vallei in california the alaskan peninsula and at kebok 4430 0130 0344 100 kilomet south of the brook rang these ar respons for develop and test variou type of direct energi weapon as well as relat research and test japan also ha a group of outstand scientist who ar conduct research on laser weapon for exampl a physic professor at the lead sendai institut of physic is work on a particl beam weapon and anoth professor is work on it with him both ar famou scientist well known in the western scientif commun thei ar conduct high energi industri laser research and have made great accomplish in us laser to cut and weld metal in 1968 physicist okada kimisa gangtian junzuo 1511 3944 0689 0146 made and oper the world s first hydrogen fluorid laser thi laser and the similar deuterium fluorid laser can both be us as laser weapon especi space base laser weapon in 1970 physicist fumi taro shi tailang 0670 1132 6745 and other scientist present a report on ga kinemat carbon dioxid laser weapon research with progress in thi area of research almost equal to that of the unit state in the earli 1980 s a us reconnaiss satellit detect that the former soviet union wa build a direct energi weapon at sari shagan and the unit state believ that it wa a type of iodin laser in addit a ga kinemat carbon dioxid laser had alreadi been put into us at luoyiqik 5012 0122 7871 0344 the unit state believ that the laser in sari shagan ha alreadi destroi a number of reentri missil warhead also the former soviet union ha also develop land base laser for air defens mission it is wide believ in the west that the former soviet union alreadi possess the abil and technolog to manufactur space weapon on 13 octob 1985 secretari of defens weinberg state in a speech to the world affair commiss in philadelphia that the soviet current possess land base laser weapon that can jam our satellit by the end of the 1980 s thei mai possess prototyp of land base laser weapon that can shoot down ballist missil in the earli 1990 s the soviet will begin experi with their us as part of a larg scale deploy system the soviet place top prioriti on airborn laser primarili for us in anti satellit warfar protect of major space facil and deal with incom cruis missil it is estim that thei will begin small scale deploy in the 1990 s accord to an articl in japan s reader s digest the unit state continu to do research on ga kinemat laser discharg laser chemic laser exim laser x rai laser gamma rai laser and argon ion laser the type of laser be research by the unit state and the former soviet union ar about the same howev us offici believ that it is possibl that their laser ar somewhat better than those of the former soviet union the former soviet union possess sever pioneer laser and their oper level is veri high the x rai laser is an exampl the soviet discov dure thermonuclear atmospher test back in 1958 that the x rai produc by thermonuclear blast can render icbm ineffect thi wa the basi which later led to the develop of x rai laser in 1972 soviet scientist publish paper on the principl of x rai and gamma rai laser it wa not until 1980 howev that the unit state first achiev an x rai laser from a nuclear explos the soviet have done a great deal of work on x rai optic and on non nuclear aspect thei have manufactur larg puls laser which us convent explos blast to be the energi sourc to produc puls laser it is estim that thi type of laser could be place into us in the 1990 s russia believ that the unit state ha instal a high power high energi laser near the kennedi space center thi could be us for anti missil or anti satellit mission to achiev it need the unit state is pai special attent to the develop of airborn laser in the 1990 s the unit state could begin limit deploy of these on the space shuttl for anti satellit and anti cruis missil mission and to protect airborn equip the unit state estim that the soviet mai have conduct experi on laser gener and their kill mechan on their salud 5 space station to develop space base laser weapon the soviet mai veri possibl test space laser weapon in the earli 1990 s these mai have power rate in the megawatt with rang of as much as 100 to 1 000 km the former soviet union ha on a number of occas conduct laser target fire test shoot down missil in flight an us laser expert believ that the best data on the damag to target meteri and mechan of laser ar found in soviet articl natur just develop a laser is not enough to make a laser weapon a seri of other technolog ar also requir such as a small effect and strong power sourc as well as modern microelectron technolog digit signal process and digit commun technolog the japanes have made mark progress in all of these aspect for exampl japan claim that for it magnet train it ha alreadi develop a rocket driven magnet flux kinemat gener that within a short time will be capabl of develop 15 megawatt of electr thi type of small light mobil power sourc can suppli laser and other beam weapon but the west doe not yet have them onli japan doe us in satellit thi technolog could bring the realiz of space base laser weapon on step closer in sum the space technolog of some superpow is capabl of fire laser weapon from satellit at target on the earth s surfac or satellit orbit in space 2 particl beam weapon on satellit to caus c sup 3 i radar surveil and track system to fail the unit state also began develop particl beam weapon in the 1960 s in the earli 1970 s it had further defin thi research and develop plan and from report in the past few year it ha invest as much as 3 billion in particl beam weapon research it is current estim that the current amount far exce thi figur there ar approxim 2 000 or more top physicist work in 350 lab conduct research on particl beam weapon begin in 1967 the former soviet union ha been conduct particl beam experi at it nuclear test site at semipalatinsk accord to report the yefuliemofu 0673 1133 0441 5459 1133 institut in leningrad spent two million rubl to construct the angela 5 1344 0766 2139 reactor pile which mai be concern with solv the problem of a power sourc for particl beam weapon a larg acceler wa construct at saluowa 5646 5012 3907 in gorki for us in the develop of particl beam weapon particl beam target test have been conduct there the electron beam bombard of icbm reentri vehicl and high energi explos and solid matter experi conduct in the laboratori at leningrad univers illustr that new progress ha been made in research on the distort mechan of particl beam as of 1988 the former soviet union had conduct eight electron beam transmiss test on it space vehicl the former soviet union also join with franc in conduct electron beam radiat experi from high altitud space survei rocket at altitud of 100 110 and 130 km the beam were transmit sever dozen km a small group of scientist led by professor bafulofusiji 1572 1133 3157 1133 2448 1015 ar current intensifi their research on proton beam weapon thei recent test a plasma beam gener provid an even better materi basi for particl beam weapon research through thi research and test the former soviet union ha explor the feasibl of particl beam space weapon it ha also made mark advanc in it research on particl sourc and particl flow accord to estim it will still be quit some time befor the former soviet union ha particl beam weapon capabl of destroi missil booster or missil warhead though it is work on thi howev it is possibl that thei will have test in the 1990 s a prototyp particl beam weapon to be us to destroi electron equip on satellit 3 attack on space base system by satellit high energi microwav weapon actual the japanes have been interest in the destruct of high energi microwav weapon for a long time thei began develop super high energi microwav radiat tube in the 1970 s furthermor thei have alreadi conduct thorough secret research on how to make weapon from high power microwav and on the kill mechan of microwav beam the japanes began develop microwav weapon earlier than the unit state also thei have a larg scale research plan for high power microwav radiat tube accord to report thei ar further along than the unit state in research on strong microwav gener and transmiss and on it interact with matter the microwav gener japan test in 1970 produc microwav puls power in the 1000 megawatt rang with effici as high as 30 percent in 1983 thei test on in the millimet wave 30 to 300 khz frequenc rang and the radiat tube gener puls power of up to 100 megawatt such success in millimet wave radiat tube research make further progress possibl in microwav weapon research the japanes govern believ that the former soviet union ha made similar progress in radio frequenc technolog and that befor veri long russia mai develop a prototyp of a short rang microwav weapon if the japanes microwav weapon doe not soon enter the practic us stage thei mai fall behind the russian the report on soviet militari strength publish in 1984 by the us depart of defens also held that soviet radio frequenc technolog is current in a stage where it can begin develop close rang microwav weapon prototyp the weapon system of mani western nation provid littl defens against such weapon thei could not onli destroi critic electron element but could also caus disorient or even physic damag to human the unit state also estim that in the 1990 s russia could test land base microwav weapon that could destroi satellit if the unit state doe not quickli conduct practic test of thi type of weapon it could lose superior in the field we can see from an analysi of these situat that the unit state japan and russia all have the capabl to us microwav weapon against our sky base system for destruct experiment attack that could be conduct secretli we must establish a foothold in earth orbit we can see that the greatest weak of a three dimension defens li outsid the atmospher in space and that the most effect method of us defens missil is for intercept unfortun although china s space technolog is second onli to the unit state and russia it doe not have suffici capabl to establish a stabl foothold in earth orbit compar to the situat in the unit state and russia the state of develop in china is extrem critic and urgent russia is a satellit superpow the former soviet union conduct an averag of 70 to 100 launch everi year with from on to sever satellit per launch thei have launch eight satellit with a singl rocket thei have more satellit than ani other countri and it is estim that as of 1982 of all of the the 2 915 space vehicl launch by the variou nation of the world 1 780 or 61 percent belong to the soviet union 33 percent belong to the unit state of these soviet satellit 73 percent were for militari us the russian have more satellit than ani other nation but their satellit do not last as long as us satellit the russian ar us number against qualiti and while continu to maintain their number ar constantli improv their qualiti for exampl in the five year from 1979 to 1984 the life expect of soviet photoreconnais satellit increas by 50 percent to the 30 to 50 dai level the russian ar put a great deal of emphasi on build up the reconnaiss and surveil capabl of space system thei ar also pai a great deal of attent to the combat applic of militari satellit their photoreconnaiss satellit constantli keep a close watch on militari conflict throughout the world and relat event for exampl after the unit state invad grenada the former soviet union immedi launch the univers 1504 satellit which pass over the airspac of that countri everi dai perform reconnaiss and surveil dure the arm conflict in salvador the univers 1471 and univers 1496 satellit were assign to fly over that countri to conduct reconnaiss and surveil mission the former soviet union also launch a number of satellit for surveil of the situat in lebanon chad the south atlant and iran although the former soviet union must also pai attent to the construct of commun satellit it doe not place the same relianc on commun satellit as the unit state in it commun with alli in europ africa the middl east and other area of the world at least 70 percent of the oversea commun of the unit state is carri by satellit while the former soviet union wa try to develop satellit commun it militari leader still possess variou surfac commun channel directli to their unit therefor even if their commun were destroi their commun abil would undergo minim damag the former soviet union began conduct anti satellit research in 1964 in the begin thei us maneuv and dock techniqu with the univers satellit and man spacecraft for preliminari anti satellit design in octob 1968 thei began anti satellit flight test by the end of 1971 thei had conduct seven test through thi test thei had an initi understand of the technolog of approach recogn and destroi enemi satellit to preveng a deleteri effect on concurr summit talk that were focuss on sign a salt treati the former soviet union halt it test launch of interceptor satellit after it launch of univers 461 on 2 decemb 1971 in the fourth year of the salt agreement 1976 which wa also the year befor the period of the agreement wa over and a year in which the follow up salt negoti were stall and make no progress the former soviet union began onc again to develop and test killer satellit by the end of 1982 it had conduct 11 new anti satellit test through thi test the soviet union on the basi of it experi in it overal success and failur construct the onli actual anti satellit weapon system in the world at that time there ar basic two type of anti satellit satellit that have been test by the former soviet union on type is the same orbit anti satellit satellit between 1968 and 1971 the former soviet union us 55 9 rocket to launch an anti satellit satellit equip with radar detect equip thi wa on of the same orbit type thi type of satellit is sent into the same orbit as the target satellit on it second orbit it begin to acceler and when it near the target satellit the command system send an order and the warhead portion explod send out larg amount of fragment and destroi the target accord to us analyst five of seven test of thi type of weapon were success it design purpos is to attack us near earth orbit satellit such as the kh 11 big bird photoreconnais satellit the second type of killer satellit is the transorbit zoom satellit becaus the first method of intercept requir the satellit to orbit twice to achiev intercept it is a chase attack method which wast time the former soviet union also tri have the satellit killer us transorbit method on it initi orbit to zoom up to the target orbit and achiev intercept on the first attempt accord to some evalu in the seven test between 1976 and 1977 three of seven such test were success these two type of intercept combat ar singl target method test of multipl launch against multipl target and singl launch against multipl target have not been conduct furthermor the former soviet union s current anti satellit satellit ar primarili gear for low orbit thei do not yet have satellit capabl of strike high orbit satellit becaus of thi thei current do not pose a threat to us earli warn and commun satellit in high orbit the galosh anti missil system also ha an anti satellit capabl after the anti satellit missil ha been launch toward the orbit of the enemi satellit it pursu the satellit in thi orbit when it near the satellit the nuclear warhead automat explod produc a shock wave thermal radiat and electromagnet puls which can destroi the satellit the aim and track subsystem of thi system is radar which can detect a target more easili than the us heat seek method howev the soviet anti satellit missil can be launch within on hour of an f 15 fighter take off and reach their target 10 minut later the surfac to air missil that the former soviet union current possess such as the sa 12 not onli have a certain anti missil capabl but thei also have a limit capabl to intercept satellit orbit near the unit state in addit the former soviet union mai us the capabl of electron station it is current develop to jam or deceiv enemi satellit or it mai us jam and destruct of enemi satellit ground station to achiev the equival result of destroi enemi satellit the former soviet union ha claim a number of time that it can store space mine in a certain orbit and upon command these space mine can be move near enemi satellit and explod to destroi them the basic method to fill in these shortcom in the three gorg project defens system ar to acceler the develop of space technolog and improv space capabl current we also need to adopt a number of other supplement method to deal with critic situat which mai occur in the near futur around 10 to 20 year first we can adopt two of the simplest anti satellit method first is the shotgun approach thi would be us our satellit to scatter steel ball along the orbit of us combat satellit in the direct opposit that of the satellit s rotat if a 30 gram steel ball were travel at 15 km per second it would pierc 15 cm into the shell of the us satellit s steel shell thi method would not cost much but would be fairli effect second is the smear approach thi would to be to sprai dust at the reflect mirror of a us or japanes satellit caus the mirror to be lopsid so that laser weapon could not be focuss thi measur is also fairli simpl but care must be taken to avoid attack by the enemi satellit dure approach secondarili we could us two method which ar not cheap but ar most effect those of space base interceptor first the small bomblet program these ar a type of smart bomb onli weigh onli 1 5 to 2 5 kg each of these small bomblet could cost 100 000 includ the cost to put them into orbit to increas the intercept rate the number of bomblet would have to be 100 time the number enemi missil which would mean on million bomblet for a total cost of 10 billion second small honeybe method thi would be deploi 10 000 to 12 000 inexpens light intercept missil in orbit signal would be sent to them by three geosynchron commun satellit whenev ani of these destruct implement is posit over our own territori the commun satellit would automat stop send a signal and at thi time the destruct implement would automat enter a critic state it could independ launch at incom missil thi type of light destruct implement could be launch into orbit with the shen iv carrier rocket launch 100 at a time everi destruct implement would cost 1 million if these were onli to protect against accident launch deploi 100 in orbit would be enough in sum if the chines ar bold enough to construct the three gorg dam thei have the capabl to protect the secur of the dam vii cross the yalu onc more of all the mani hot spot around china the korean peninsula cannot be regard as anyth but the hottest of them all becaus of the geopolit relationship china is forc to expend a great deal of effort to try to stabil the situat there to prevent the fire of war from burn to it own back door without doubt the establish of diplomat relat between china and south korea wa a major step by china to achiev strateg stabil although it anger north korea from the consider of long term interest the advantag outweigh the disadvantag experienc observ ar all abl to see that south korea doe repres a threat to china should south korea invad the north the chines would still support north korea thi is someth that could veri possibl happen the south korean g7 project the level of scienc and technolog in south korea is onli equival to 9 8 percent that of the unit state and 12 percent of that of japan it rank 38th in the world in basic scienc look at the drastic chang situat if south korea doe not lai a scientif and technic foundat toward becom a develop countri in the next year or two and if it fail to ensur it own independ technolog within the next five or six year then in the 21st centuri it will be look down upon as be subservi to develop nation to meet these requir the south korean have propos the goal of becom a develop nation by the year 2000 the g7 project the goal of the g7 project is to rais south korea s scienc and technolog level to the advanc level of the seven western nation by the 21st centuri thi project ha 14 primari technolog target includ super integr circuit transistor wide area commun network technolog electr car artifici intellig comput sens technolog new medicin and agricultur chemic lead edg product equip new energi sourc biolog engin new materi high definit televis new gener reactor pile new gener transport equip and part and environment protect thi project will formal begin in mai of thi year and will last for 10 year thi project will cost more than 4 75 trillion wan to accomplish the goal of thi project the south korean have adopt a polici of four domest line and four foreign circl the four domest line ar l increas the size of the teach staff at scientif and technic colleg and univers and set up branch colleg and univers 2 revis colleg and univers system increas the number of student recruit into scientif and technic colleg and univers 3 allow some univers student to studi for their doctor to develop talent as earli as possibl and 4 establish addit scientif and technic high school there ar current 10 all of these ar interconnect and by the 21st centuri south korea should becom an educ societi with 150 000 scientist of which 10 percent ar to be world class the four foreign circl ar to strengthen scientif and technic foreign relat recruit 2 000 scientist to come to korea to work and to cooper in scienc and technolog with foreign nation in the us circl there is draft a patent and secret protect agreement establish a us korean scientif and technic consortium and forg a common strateg defens plan with the unit state onli by combin us scienc and technolog with korean product technolog will thei be abl to put a stop to japan s technolog monopoli in the japanes circl on the basi of a scienc and technolog cooper agreement sign in 1988 south korea and japan will jointli select and conduct common research project and thei will continu to prod japan to transfer high technolog in the west european circl south korea hope to enhanc common research in project select through the council of defens minist and the committe on scientif and technolog cooper of the major nation in west europ england franc germani and itali in the former soviet union circl on the basi of a scientif and technic agreement sign with the former soviet union it is stipul that in the next five year south korea will conduct joint research with the former soviet on 48 lead edg technolog project it will also invit between 200 and 400 rank soviet scientist to take part in the g7 project and it will invit 20 soviet scientist to come to south korean univers and research compon to lectur after the dismember of the soviet union the russian feder ha promis to continu to honor thi agreement for scientif cooper the g7 project is like an atom explos on the korean peninsula a cooper is surviv separat is death campaign for technolog cooper ha appear in korea the korean gold star and sam sung corpor have decid to exchang the 3 500 patent thei possess uncondition and without compens thei will keep no secret from each other and will work togeth to deal with pressur from foreign enterpris thi year the three major korean shipbuild compani the modern heavi industri compani the dayu 1129 1342 shipbuild compani and sam song heavi industri abandon their estrang and competit struggl and join forc in a bid for five supertank for the saudi arabian nation ship compani in competit against japanes and european shipbuild the unit state and japan have continu to provid technolog for almost 4 000 item for south korea thei work togeth in the develop of almost 1 000 product technolog to increas intern competit china did not becom part of south korea s technolog circl but on 24 august it announc the establish of diplomat relat with south korea there ar two explan in diplomat circl concern the establish of diplomat relat between china and south korea on is that due to the high cost of labor at home the south korean were attract by cheap labor in china south korean export to europ the unit state and japan ar not do well and china is a market with a tremend futur the second explan is that the establish of diplomat relat between china and south korea chang the strateg pictur in asia asia will becom a new econom block with china as the hub thi econom block which is connect to the korean peninsula hong kong and taiwan will serv to constrain japan to a certain degre japan s daili new also believ that becaus of the establish of diplomat relat between south korea and china the next strateg structur in east asia ha alreadi been form and it is a triangl form with china japan and korea at the corner thi new triangular structur with the addit of the southeast asian nation which have made amaz progress will form a four side structur becom the basic layout of asia as it race toward the 21st centuri north korea s centuri paradis plan at the same time south korea wa announc the develop of the g7 project the north korean propos the establish of a korean type of socialist centuri paradis call it the centuri paradis plan gener in the simplest term the specif content of thi centuri paradis plan is to realiz the dream of all korean eat rice have meat in their soup have good cloth and live in good hous to achiev thi plan the assembl made three separ domest polici decis the first wa to strengthen socialist propaganda the second wa to make chang in state leadership and the third wa to revis the parti charter concern the question of social in the word of the assembl communiqu a seri of event current occur on the world stage ar eddi along the journei of mankind toward the new democrat order therefor we should have an optimist view of the current world situat even if other should give us boundless treasur we would not abandon social and chose anoth path social is more dear to us than life the communiqu also state that korean social is the respons of the peopl themselv accord to their actual situat to guid their own strength establish the most outstand social korean social doe not mimic ani other extant form or experi and doe not depend on the strength of other rather it will solv new problem of theori and practic after the establish of the socialist order accord to it own method it is an independ social the communiqu further state that improv the food cloth and lodg of the peopl is the plan for socialist and communist construct which will have to be accomplish under condit of ever intensifi plot by the enemi and even more complex situat carri out thi plan will better displai the superior of the korean type of social where all ar happi and live as equal and it will realiz the dream of the centuri of all korean be abl to eat rice have meat in their soup wear good cloth and have good home the lifestyl of the korean style of social is all of the peopl of the countri close unit around the parti and the leader to form a larg revolutionari famili all live togeth a life of collectiv all peopl must be highli organ and perform in an orderli manner all as on live and work in accord with the revolutionari requir thei must oppos eas and comfort lax luxuri and splittism from the cloth thei wear to the hat thei wear thei must conform to the requir of the revolutionari era thei must pai attent to disciplin have a sens of proprieti and be nobl mind yet simpl thei have conduct larg scale chang in administr arrang of parti and govern leader the premier and vice premier have been chang and an old premier who had left offic befor hi term wa complet wa ask to serv again thei also have place some person with a real understand of econom into import posit thei have carri out some fairli major chang in the parti charter for exampl thei have remov the word marxist give promin to overal ideolog thei have given nation defens a chapter of it own and have written into the charter that the peopl ar to be arm all forc ar to have cadr and the arm forc ar to be modern we can see from thi that thi is a major move by north korea direct at south korea to achiev thi paradis of the centuri north korea ha becom bold and ask the outsid world for econom cooper thei ar cooper with the unit nation develop plan offic and ar jointli establish their own first intern bank with the rubi group in hong kong it is especi worth note that thei even befor china had announc the special econom zone in jilin s hunchun area thei establish a free econom trade zone in the mengjin and xianfeng area in the north with an area of 621 squar km thei also announc that mengjin xianfeng and qingjin were free trade port and that thei hope to negoti with china question concern the develop of the tumen river delta in decemb 1991 the premier of north and south korea sign the north and south korea agreement of understand mutual nonaggress and trade for joint develop of resourc peopl develop exchang of materi and invest cooper thei establish joint invest factori thei hope that the director of the world peac leagu would go to the north and invest there the socialist and capitalist camp on the korean peninsula have begun a competit and struggl not involv gun crack in the format in the intern competit in scienc and technolog there ar two oppos bloc the first bloc is form primarili of the unit state japan and western europ thi bloc ha an obviou superior in the field of scienc and technolog the second bloc is compos of a number of major third world nation such as the four dragon asia china india and brazil thei have invest larg amount of manpow and materi into scienc and technolog to improv their level of scienc and technolog as well as overal nation strength and thei have achiev startl accomplish the former soviet union ha a good scientif research foundat and lot of talent but due to mani year of polit unrest and it dissolut there ha been an outflow of it talent it ha had a stagnant economi and it competit in scienc and technolog ha been serious weaken it is current in the midst of chang and adjust becaus of thi the scientif and technic struggl go on in the korean peninsula is more precis a battl between two major bloc than a competit between two major camp howev these bloc ar not complet solid and in the south of the peninsula some crack have occur in the first bloc the unit state and japan ar current econom superpow howev becaus the japanes do not have the role of policeman to the world as the unit state doe for sever decad thei have concentr on econom develop in less than 10 year the japanes economi ha grown to a point where it constitut a threat to the economi of the unit state accord to statist in 1951 japan s gross nation product wa on twentieth that of the unit state and in 1978 japan s nomin gross nation product wa 971 7 billion and that of the unit state wa 2 25 trillion in the world s nomin gross product for 1988 the unit state repres 24 4 percent with 4 88 trillion and japan repres 14 3 percent with 2 86 trillion the japanes nomin gross nation product wa 59 percent of that of the unit state through the struggl for south korea s g7 project in less than 10 year it gross nation product will basic approach that of the unit state in earli 1989 the averag per capita incom in japan wa more than 23 000 about 5 000 more than that of the unit state japan s foreign reserv were 89 26 billion in mai of 1989 which wa 3 4 time those of the unit state japanes invest wa 60 4 billion in 1985 and by 1989 it oversea invest wa 250 billion furthermor it ha becom the world s largest creditor nation the speed with which the japanes economi grew and the size of the assault ha startl and frighten the unit state therefor a struggl over the first place in the world economi ha develop within the unit state and japan bloc japan is no longer content with the space in it small island nation of onli three million plu squar kilomet the unit state similarli cannot allow a small island nation to outdo it the earliest struggl is an econom war the fuse that ignit the war is the sale of japanes automobil in the unit state not onli have the japanes car taken over the us market but under the japanes automobil assault a number of us automobil plant have fold even the largest gener motor ha gone into bankruptci with 150 000 peopl lose their job face thi situat the us senat ha propos to the presid a bill to boycott japanes good prohibit the import of japanes automobil to slow down the japanes economi the night befor the us presid wa to sign thi bill the prime minist of japan flew to the unit state and visit the white hous where he engag in a number of secret negoti with the presid the content of these talk were never made public howev after the talk the unit state never announc the senat s bill and the japanes export no more car to the unit state thei join togeth and combin to do even greater busi imagin a bloodi peac korean reunif the fifth session of the north and south korean talk on peac reunif ar current be conduct in pyongyang in the previou session of talk the two side reach a unanim agreement on their hope and determin for peac reunif that wa publicli announc to the world howev there still exist great differ over the post reunif name of the countri polit personnel arrang militari man and the posit of the korean worker parti the north korean want to us the name korean peopl republ while the south korean want to us the name of korea as for polit personnel arrang and militari man the north korean demand equal represent while the south korean demand a ratio base on econom strength both side agre that the capit should be decid through a vote by the peopl as for the posit of the korean worker parti both side agre that thi parti should be remov from power and that north and south korean parti should be equal howev as for how communist parti member should be handl the north korean demand that the parti cadr all be place into lead govern compon at variou level while the south korean resolut oppos thi becaus the north korean socialist paradis plan ha continu to proce veri slowli and the south korean g7 project ha seen some preliminari result the north korean have been place at a disadvantag in the talk while peopl ar still guess at the outcom of the fifth round of talk good new come out of pyongyang concern peac reunif next the south korean militari includ plane and tank march in a veri orderli manner into north korea without a shot fire at the border the peopl armi command at the front line have receiv an order sign by their leader and at the same time thei have heard the good new broadcast from pyongyang radio on peac reunif and welcom the south korean compatriot return to the motherland howev shortli after cross the border the south korean unit veri quickli detain the command of front line unit at the regiment level and abov veri quickli the unit receiv the intern new that leader and top government personnel have been detain pyongyang final transmit the sound of rifl and artilleri fire then a larg number of unit engag in arm fight with the south korean unit howev becaus the front line defens posit have been broken through and the south korean militari is not us the same weapon it us 40 year ago unabl to hold their ground the defend take to their heel the so call peac reunif is noth more than a militari coup it is a plot cook up by the unit state and japan for the south korean to swallow the arm forc of north korea thei take advantag of the opportun afford by the negoti for a group of agent compos of south korean and american to captur by surpris high rank north korean gener and govern offici and forc them to sign order for the front line unit when the peopl armi becom awar of what ha happen it conduct a brave arm struggl against the invad south korean forc the world s major newspap and radio and televis station all announc the same new civil war ha broken out in korea the unit state and japan us thi opportun to onc more manipul the unit nation into decid to send un world peacekeep forc to korea the so call un peacekeep forc ar actual compos of militari unit of the unit state and japan the unit state directli us three mechan infantri divis on motor infantri divis on armor divis and on airborn divis total 104 000 men in addit there ar the 40 000 men in militari unit station in south korea and the 65 000 men in unit station in japan for a grand total of 210 000 men at the same time the seventh fleet is sent from the western to the eastern pacif japan send in two motor infantri divis the seventh tank divis on naval self defens forc fleet and on air armi total 100 000 men these joint forc of 300 000 men togeth with the 600 000 men in the south korean armi come press into north korea their final object is to take north korea by militari forc and then expand to the northern border with china thi help toward korean unif is just the first step in the us and japanes plan for world hegemoni the total size of the north korean armi wa origin 840 000 men howev in the past sever year to concentr even more financ on the centuri paradis there have been two reduct in forc total 340 000 men and leav onli 500 000 men furthermor the 200 000 man front line unit have basic lost their combat effect thu the 300 000 man peopl s armi in the interior is no match for the unit forc of the unit state japan and south korea in less than on month the north korean unit retreat toward the border with china and some unit even cross over into china it goe without sai that regard the civilian anyon who is a member of the korean worker parti and cadr at all level have basic all retreat with the militari unit to the tonghua special district and the yanji korean autonom prefectur in jilin provinc in china old score ar not yet settl cross the yalu again the north korean peopl armi and govern offici from variou level that have retreat to the north form a provision govern of north korea repres the govern in unifi leadership over the peopl armi the provision govern make an urgent and emerg request for arm support from the peopl s republ of china the chines govern is place in a dilemna becaus of thi it could send troop but china is current concentr it forc for econom develop and it ha establish diplomat relat with south korea becaus of the trade agreement it is try to relax tension with the unit state and japan it could not send troop but north korea is an old friend and a close neighbor back in the 1950 s when the peopl s republ of china had just been found and wa veri poor it help north korea defeat us imperi at the cost of hundr of thousand of men now that china is rich it cannot forget it old friend in other word with almost two million north korean pour into china the onli reason thing to do would be to help them get back home there would be no altern but to resolut send troop and help korea resist the unit state onc again there ar four reason for thi first china and north korea ar old friend who reli on each other second the object of the unit state and japan in jointli invad north korea is not onli to take over the korean peninsula but also is world hegemoni if we were to sit and watch the next step would be even more difficult to deal with third whether or not the unit state cross over sever hundr north korean refuge swarm across the tumen river would have a tremend affect on econom develop in the area at a time when china had just enter into a critic period of cooper develop with taiwan such a loss could possibl be even greater than that of support the korean the final reason is that there is an unsettl debt from the 1950 s that is the debt of the fifth campaign to resist the unit state and aid korea of the 1950 s after the volunt armi enter korea begin on 25 octob 1950 it conduct counterattack and strateg

south korean forc by 21 april the volunt armi had fought continu for a number of dai and had us up all of it ration and ammunit furthermor the raini season wa approach and sever river behind them would make combat and the transport of suppli difficult therefor thei stop their assault and on the 23rd began to move to the north at the same time thei request that the central militari commiss approv thi action mao zedong cabl a repli to peng dehuai approv the retreat and reorgan he also instruct that regard where thei should lai up as long as the enemi wa readi to attack the further to the

task forc of 13 divis from four armi send motor infantri artilleri and tank along the highwai to pursu our retreat forc the volunt armi wa unprepar for thi rapid pursuit by the enemi and wa unabl to give itself effect cover when switch over to defens combat also due to excess casualti unit action were limit and some unit were caught in a passiv situat while switch over to defens on the 24th the 180th divis of the 62nd armi receiv order from the corp to provid cover for the transport north of the casualti southwest of ch unch on thei becam encircl by enemi artilleri and were wrap up thi is an old grudg of the 180th divis of the 62nd armi although the fifth campaign wa veri success overal and despit the thorough victori of the campaign to resist the unit state and aid korea thi divis s grudg is a black mark in the histori what will replac small calib infantri rifl dure the korean war in the 1950s small calib infantri rifl were us to counter the enemi s air power and artilleri what weapon will be us in the next korean war dure the last korean war the fight at kamryong had to be the cruelest and fiercest of the war from 14 octob through 25 novemb 1954 through 43 dai and night of fierc fight and over an area of 3 7 squar kilomet occupi by two compani the us militari pour in over 1 9 million artilleri shell and 5 000 bomb destroi fortif on two mountain top and lower those peak by two meter thi wa the fiercest and most unusu battl fought in a small area in the histori of warfar howev dure thi battl the weapon us by the two side were apart from the us militari s aircraft artilleri piec and incendiari shell the volunt armi s machin gun infantri rifl bangalor and hand grenad howev in the next war the weapon of the previou war will not be in evid when the time come us e 3 watchtow earli warn aircraft f 117 f 15 and f 16 fighter french mirag 2000 fighter ea 6b electron warfar aircraft and nighthawk f 117a stealth aircraft will be airborn there will also be carpet bomb

1a1 and m 1a2 advanc tank will contend with chines t 80s and t 85s blackhawk helicopt anti tank missil and anti tank rocket launcher will also be involv in these tank battl these nemes of the tank will make armor combat even more difficult the us and japanes infantri will us apach and comanch helicopt against our infantri and will be equip with highli accur individu weapon that fire at rate of 1 000 round per minut thei will be equip with on man missil to us against tank and aircraft thei can mount helicopt at ani time under ani condit and reach ani design point thei can also conduct the most effect mobil combat against enemi tank aircraft and ground unit while in motion in the next war in korea the satellit of both side mai join in the fight at sea will be even more complex the seventh fleet the japanes 88th fleet and china s special task forc will be the primari forc in thi naval battl the seventh fleet possess the most advanc carrier and the most advanc ship born aircraft although the 88th fleet doe not have an aircraft carrier it fleet coordin combat capabl ar first in the world although china s task forc is young becaus it will includ advanc missil escort a submarin fleet and outstand offic and men as well as a larg number of aircraft fly out of the jiaodong peninsula that can effect coordin in combat with the fleet it is hard to sai what the outcom would be would it be better to cross the river or the sea thi question ha been rais if chines forc went to korea again would thei take the same rout as befor chines militari expert believ that if in the next war in korea a major forc of 400 000 un troop and 400 000 south korea troop press toward the korean chines border it would be best to send troop across the sea and not across the yalu why do thei sai thi there ar advantag and disadvantag to cross the river the advantag is that we could reli on china s substanti rear support that is to sai if we do not cross the river from north to south then we would lose the advantag of be abl to reli on the larg rear suppli of the chines forc howev the disadvantag of cross the river ar even more obviou if we try to launch a push across the board we could not do it and if we tri to penetr with a larg forc we would not be abl to penetr if we us small unit then even if thei did penetr thei would not be abl to gain a foothold if we sent troop across the sea we could avoid the enemi s strength and attack hi weak stab a dagger directli into the enemi s heart combin with the unit on the northern front we could form a pincer attack cut off and encircl the enemi fight a war of annihil if we ar to cut the korean peninsula in two where would we cut it there ar two differ possibl plan the first is to begin at the 38th parallel the advantag of begin here is that after the land it would be possibl to take advantag of the reinforc exist defens fortif along the south korean border front to effect solidifi a land posit and prevent an attack by the enemi from the south thi would accomplish the object of isol and surround the enemi howev the disadvantag of begin here is that the land battl would be veri fierc and after the land the rear suppli line would be too far awai therefor we would be take on too much to handl and would be wrap up by the enemi the second place to land is along a line from sinanju to namp o the disadvantag of thi plan is that after the land there would be no exist fortif to us and we would have to reli complet on the land unit themselv to gain a foothold howev the advantag of thi plan is that it is nearer to the chines mainland at the same time the land combat would be easier to fight becaus thi area is a fine exampl of the territori around pyongyang the mass would provid a good foundat when us forc arriv thei mai not gain a firm foothold therefor if we were abl to land here and carri out a rescu plan us special forc unit to rescu the north korean govern leader it would be possibl to call on the north korean peopl to organ new group of unit as quickli as possibl especi those crack troop that have alreadi retir if thei and the mass remain in north korea ar all organ thei can fight a peopl war in thi manner the korean militari line of arm all the peopl have cadr throughout the militari and modern the entir militari will plai a critic role at the critic moment all peopl ar soldier and in a veri short time thei can organ at least 100 000 new korean militia forc the final select is for the latter plan in thi war china s special polic forc will plai an unexpect role thi is becaus the unit state and japan will never have dream that the chines would adopt such feroci tactic as a result thei will veri quickli rescu the north korean leader who under hous arrest thei will activ the north korean combat readi radio and televis station and the leader will give televis speech to the peopl all of the peopl will be soldier and will veri quickli organ a new militia coordin with the north korean peopl s armi the land follow up unit in the second and third echelon will land without problem coordin with the north korean peopl armi the chines and korean forc will achiev the strateg combat polici to defend against the south attack in the north the unit forc of the unit state japan and south korea that will have alreadi rush up to the yalu will see the fire in their own backyard and will quickli send troop to the rear thu the origin northern fortress will not exist thi will make it possibl for the chines unit aid korea to move to the south final on million men from the unit in china s northeast militari region the 200 000 men of the korean peopl armi forc that have alreadi move into northeast china and anoth 800 000 new korean forc form from the korean refuge will form a forc of two million men move from the north to the south on the korean peninsula with the chines and korean wrap up the american the battl to encircl and wipe out the enemi will be carri out on the ground and in the air in the region of myohyangsan nangrimsan and kwanmosan at the same time on the yellow sea a startl sea and air battl will occur these ar not the encircl and counter encircl human sea tactic of the 1950 s and it will not be like the gulf war thi is a combin of high technolog and low technolog a three dimension war with both modern weapon and convent weapon us side by side the variou countri will all us the most modern weapon the unit state will us the fourth gener fighter and tank it us and improv dure the gulf war japan will bring out mani weapon it ha not reveal befor china will also us the weapon it ha updat over the past sever year as well as it newest weapon some will be experiment weapon that have not yet been us to equip the unit howev most of the korean forc will still be basic equip with convent infantri weapon how should such a war be fought ar we up to the task how should the war be fought how will we complet the encircl the war will be an unusu strang on an unusu difficult on and an unusu cruel on thi is becaus it will have the three follow characterist first thi will be an especi strang war just as some have ask how is it possibl to match up modern missil and infantri rifl awac and hand radio or satellit weapon and air raid bunker how can the latter element be us howev fact demonstr that thi hypothesi is wrong if we sai that such thing ar of no us in desert region and wide open space like the persian gulf nonetheless in mountain forest region or in high mountain and vallei it is a differ stori the korean peopl armi and the chines pla will miracul bottl up an 800 000 man modern motor infantri in thi region although thei might not be abl to wipe out thi forc thei will have stop it the korean peopl under the guid philosophi of arm all of the peopl will dig mani air defens tunnel furthermor these will be abl to withstand atom bomb attack and will plai a major role insid these tunnel there will be store variou type of weapon equip and food the us japanes and south korean forc will be caught by surpris and there will be anoth vietnam type war here second thi war will not be over in a veri short time but will be fought with difficulti both side mai spend sever month see saw back and forth or the war mai last even longer neither side will be abl to defeat the other side easili the us japanes and korean forc will want a quick end to the war but thei will not be abl to us mani of their weapon their missil cannot just blow up rock in the mountain and fish in the river the chines navi will have a rough time of it in the naval battl howev onc the chines militari ha a firm foothold in the pyongyang area the navi task forc will immedi retreat back to it base here the us and japanes naval superior will be lost becaus we have anti missil ballist defens system and advanc coastal defens system we also have a good of scienc and technolog the second bloc is compos of a number of major c sup 3 1 system unless thei want to directli declar war on china thei will not dare to come caus troubl natur thi war will also be unusu cruel thi is becaus us bomb can blow off the top of a mountain and the missil of the us forc can drill into cave the price paid by the korean and chines militari will be great but there will be too mani mountain top too mani cave and too mani peopl the unit state will not be abl to us it bomb to level all of the mountain on most of the korean peninsula to recov the cave on by on and to regain the mountain top on by on will requir hand to hand fight onc the american leav their aircraft and tank thei ar realli paper tiger in mani place the unit state will not be abl to us it tank the us armi reli on helicopt for basic mobil howev the on man anti aircraft missil of the korean and chines militari ar suffici becaus of thi the us armi will lose almost as mani men in helicopt go down with their helicopt as the korean will lose in the cave do we have the capabl of do thi can the wish of the gener be realiz a strang forc on the sea when the war is rage in korea and both side ar engag in close hand to hand combat the earli warn system of both side will suddenli see a strang forc on the sea it will be a huge armada fly no countri s flag thei will be come out of the north toward the east coast of korea thei will be head toward the combat zone who ar thei thei ar not the american the japanes the chines nor the korean could it be the french no could it be the english no it appear to be the russian onli thei have a fleet thi larg onli thei have such an advanc fleet but thei have in the past veri clearli express their neutral on the korean question then why ar thei come thei ar either come to put out the fire or to beat someon back but could thei put out the fire with three larg nation fight thei could not then thei have come to beat someon back who have thei come to beat back if thei have come to help the north korean and chines then the chines and korean might veri quickli send the unit state and japan home or at least back to south korea if thei have come to help the unit state and japan then the chines and korean ar finish everyon is just wait and watch viii thoroughli resolv the problem of the south china sea island if on were to ask what is the main place where the chines militari face a local conflict the answer would be the south china sea for china the resolut of the south china sea island problem is a major nation affair of increas urgenc in februari 1992 after the announc of china s territori water law the variou asean nation and vietnam all bought advanc fighter aircraft such as the f 16 and mirag 2000 and quickli built up their naval air forc thei also acceler their offshor petroleum explor and militari deploy on the sea and island thei alreadi occupi thei ar well prepar to fight china to the end in the south china sea and swear to protect their interest recent vietnam ask to join asean vietnames leader visit the asean nation to further enhanc cooper there is a trend toward vietnam unit with asean against china as the situat develop there is the possibl that other nation such as japan or the unit state will becom involv in the south china sea to protect their major ship lane and strateg interest in the south pacif to prevent the south china sea conflict from escal the chines govern ha alreadi made concess and work hard with all parti at the end of 1989 premier li peng visit malaysia and propos us friendli mean to hold negoti on differ exist between the nation concern until thi happen it would be best to tabl thi question in june and juli of 1991 while chairman yang shangkun wa visit indonesia he stress the us of peac mean to resolv the disput and advoc joint develop of the island dure those same month a spokesman from the chines foreign ministri wu jianmin describ at a press confer the stand of the chines govern on the question of the nansha island advoc set the disput asid and jointli develop the nansha island up until the eighth nation peopl congress thi year the chines govern continu to reiter it stand call for negoti to resolv the disput and peac joint develop howev experienc observ note that the chines govern s current stand is to sacrific econom interest in exchang for sovereignti and territori integr and it is seek the right and interest of a peac environ along it peripheri what china mean by it propos joint develop is that while recogn that the nansha island ar chines territori the variou nation concern could jointli share in the ocean resourc of the nansha water thi is just like the fabl of kong rong give the larger pear to hi younger brother it is an obviou concess there is still a certain degre of difficulti in resolv the disput and protect sovereignti and there ar mani complic factor first china doe not like war if there is a on percent chanc of peac it would rather work 100 percent toward peac and have a worldwid reput of be a power nation that doe not forc it will on smaller nation second china is now try to take advantag of favor circumst and is work all out for econom develop if war break out in the south china sea it will interfer with the speed of develop third chines leader who ar well vers in militari tactic know veri well that the first ploi is plan next ar diplomat effort next is the us of forc and next is attack citi attack citi is onli done as a last resort therefor good militari strategist can defeat the forc of other without combat and take citi without long sieg thei can destroi countri without prolong fight although the nansha island ar chines territori to us militari forc is not in her best interest and it would not be a good strategi to go on a long expedit fourth chines naval and air power ar the weakest of it militari forc thei ar not suffici to recov lost territori with militari might from the militari standpoint thi is the most import factor thi is also the fundament reason that vietnam and the asean countri have dare to set foot on the nansha island is there ani hope for a peac resolut of the conflict the next centuri will be on of struggl over control of the ocean thi is commonli recogn by the strategist of all nation scientist believ that not onli do the ocean cover 70 percent of the surfac of the earth but also their abund resourc ar far greater than those of the land although land resourc ar be constantli diminish and will soon be exhaust it can be state that in the next centuri whoever control the ocean will control the world therefor over the past sever year not onli have a number of major countri begun to expand their influenc on the ocean even some develop countri have shift the focu of their strategi to the ocean make the establish of a qualiti naval forc of primari strateg import china is no except why is thi so from 1973 to 1982 the unit nation conven the third law of the sea confer after heat debat the confer final pass the unit nation law of the sea treati the pass of thi

but in ani envent it is not to exce 350 nautic mile coastal nation have sovereign right to miner and bilog resourc within thi scope the forebear of the chines peopl did not fail to leav us these three properti accord to the stipul of the treati china can demark a maritim exclus econom zone and continent shelf of 3 million squar km our territori sea howev we do not no what fraudul claim our neihbor will secretli make the deepest caus of the nansha island problem deriv from these properti and thi struggl over maritim resourc for vietnam and the asean countri the nansha island problem concern their own develop and tremend econom profit howev for china it signifi much more china ha onli 2 808 squar meter of ocean per capita eight percent of what japan ha china s territori land to territori water ratio is 10 3 while for vietnam it is 1 2 and for the philippin and indonesia it is as much as 1 10 it ha been reveal by expert that the oil and ga reserv under the south china sea ar about 35 billion ton with most of the three major basin on the china continent shelf the extract valu of thi would be sever ten of billion of dollar thi undoubtedli ha a tremend attract for all countri involv in the disput over the nansha island howev accord to estim by the japanes institut of energi econom futur petroleum requir in the pacif region will increas at the rate of 2 4 percent per year until the year 2000 thi will reach 4 88 billion ton therefor a number of intern observ believ that the south china sea ha the greatest possibl of becom the second persian gulf whether becaus of the oil under the ocean or an outbreak of war the announc of the chines territori water law and the contract between china and the unit state for joint explor of oil and ga resourc in the nansha island ar two practic and import step by the chines govern on the problem of the nansha island it not onli onc more express the determin of the chines govern to protect it territori sovereignti but at the same time it also signal that the chines govern mai adopt measur and method other than a peac resolut of the disput in april of thi year deputi chairman of the central militari commiss gener liu huaq in the compani of polit commissar of the east sea fleet admir lian yaoqian review the east sea fleet and request that the offic and men increas their vigil to be readi for war he also request that thei increas their awar to protect the blue nation territori establish new merit for china s four modern for everi move by china vietnam and the asean countri immedi react in kind thi is especi true of vietnam on the on hand vietnam protest through diplomat channel and on the other hand it us variou tool to enhanc it antagonist propaganda toward china attack china by name as invad vietnames territori worsen the tens situat in the area and be the worst threat in the nansha area at the same time vietnam believ that china mai take further action concern the nansha island becaus of thi the vietnames militari ha increas it combat readi activ direct against china in the nansha island in mai 1992 the vietnames armi chief of staff and navi command conven a militari meet in ho chi min citi to reevalu china s naval and air forc strength and formul a new combat plan for naval and air support in the nansha island water accord to the spirit of collectiv in ho chi min citi the vietnames air forc ha begin in earli june conduct a number of exercis to support combat in the nansha island organ with china as the adversari thei have restor su 22 reconnaiss activ over the nansha island and zhejiang provinc activ that had been stop for a year the vietnames navi ha also tighten control over the nansha water expand it patrol zone from three to five nautic mile from the island and reef it occupi to 10 nautic mile it also ha step up action to pursu and drive out chines fish boat the stand of the asean countri involv in the nansha island disput ar veri much the same as the vietnames polici in juli 1991 the asean countri conven a discuss confer on the nansha island question in indonesia it basic theme wa the south pole model advoc by malaysia and the philippin for the joint develop of resourc in the south china sea thi would be the freez of sovereignti and share of resourc thu the south china sea face the danger of becom intern water the nansha island issu should not be drag out due to the seriou disput and sharp militari opposit over the sovereignti question there ar still great obstacl to the peac recognit of sovereignti and joint develop of the nansha island hope for by the chines govern the possibl of militari conflict or war still exist for china the most import matter is when and how to resolv the question how much longer will the chines govern be abl to put the nansha island problem asid accord to the statut of limit in intern law when on countri occupi the land of anoth for a fairli long time and effect rule thi territori without ani interfer then after a number of year it can legal take over ownership the length of time for thi vari normal it is consid to be 50 year the final time limit for the nansha island is the year 2020 howev from current development trend the question of the nansha island is becom more and more an intern question with the nation involv in the disput acceler it internation should it becom an intern question china would no longer have suffici ground to us militari forc to recov the island militarili it could be face with a multin forc under the name of the unit nation at such a time there would be a chang in the natur of the strateg situat that would be disadvantag to china therefor the 1990 s ar the kei time for resolv the nansha island question onc thei ar over china mai have lost a histor opportun china mai us ani on of the follow three method on is peac diplomat method the effect of thi method is determin by the extent to which the nation involv ar will to make concess on the question of principl and interest current it look as if thi would be fairli difficult anoth is the us of arm forc to recov the island thi method look simpl but it is actual veri complic furthermor after the island ar recov troop will have to be station there for a long time to hold them otherwis after the major forc move back north the other countri will come back again anoth method is to us militari might to appli diplomat pressur forc the other side to make concess the disadvantag to thi is that it could lead to a new cold war in southeast asia from current development trend all of these three method fall into the realm of possibl choic accord to foreign specul the possibl that the chines militari will us forc is becom more and more obviou obstacl to the us of militari forc if the chines want to retak the island of the south china sea thei would gobbl them up like a hungri tiger thi is how militari expert describ what would happen in a war in the south china sea from a tactic model at the china navi institut of strateg studi we can clearli see that the previou descript by militari expert is not a major exagger if the chines navi launch an assault on the nansha island it will still be face with a number of thorni problem accord to an analysi of the basic factor of time geographi and populac the chines could be at a distinct disadvantag time becaus the chines navi ha not yet finish it modern process it ha not yet achiev the level of equip that it should have in particular it doe not have it first aircraft carrier therefor now is not the best time to solv the problem of the nansha island geographi although the nansha island ar chines territori thei ar far from the mainland and ar surround by vietnam the philippin malaysia brunei and indonesia it is more than 1 000 km from china to the nansha island but from the philippin or malaysia it is onli a littl over 100 km thi is without a doubt a tire journei for the chines navi and it combat line and rear support line would be veri long if a task forc were organ and sent to the nansha island it would take more than 100 vessel just to support the combat ship thi would mean that on third of the fleet s attack forc would be us for support populac on resolv the question of the nansha island china is in opposit to allianc about to be form if taiwan were to take china s side the situat would be optimist if china and taiwan ar unabl to maintain a consist line regard foreign nation then there is no wai china could have the advantag of the populac the unit state could directli or indirectli becom involv in nansha island affair in thi case the situat could be even more disadvantag for china we can see from thi how urgent and complex the nansha island question is for china s naval leader howev the new gener of leader fill with a strong spirit of nation will never abandon their effort to bring about the return of the nansha island to the bosom of the motherland comparison of forc current in the nansha island if we were to sai that now is the time to resolv the question of the nansha island our greatest advantag would lie in the ratio of militari forc all of the nation involv in the disput over the nansha island ar small militari power in militari forc alon thei ar no match for china even if thei were to join forc thei might not be ani match for china accord to the most recent statist

vietnam move the center of graviti of it troop deploy to the south three armi make up 60 percent of the total forc ar deploi along the coast to achiev their dream of be an maritim superpow we can see from the data abov that none of these countri ha the capabl to take on china even if the naval and air power of all five countri were combin it would clearli still be too littl thei would not even be strong enough to take on taiwan therefor from a pure militari analysi it would be a fairli easi task to drive the occupi forc from these island on moder size task forc wold be enough howev the problem would be how to hold onto the recov territori thi is the most practic problem the magic weapon for defeat the enemi in the fall of 1992 a long rang combat exercis with the nansha island as the background had just conclud at a certain militari base in south china the militari research were secretli call to a nondescript meet room there wa a heat discuss over the local war the chines militari might conduct in the nansha island the meet focuss on resolv the major problem of principl over guid philosophi and combat polici of the chines forc fight in the nansha island these have form a basi for polici by the highest command agenc the meet believ that in a war in the nansha island thei would have to achiev the best possibl result under the worst condit thei would have to us a combin of fight and intimid to quickli bring a quick conclus to the first stage which would be to drive out those occupi the island to do thi a war in the nansha island would have to compli with the follow principl principl of surpris all war prepar would have to be done in a wai that would allow the attack to be a surpris catch the oppon unawar as much as possibl under the condit of exist equip and technolog so it would be imposs for them to organ a time counterattack at the same time after take the island make prepar for hold them for a prolong period of time principl of focus attack it will be necessari to concentr forc to first attack the vietnames forc contain the vietnames air forc as much as possibl to prevent the vietnames from reinforc their troop in the nansha island the focu of the attack on the ocean should be against the indonesian submarin and escort if it is possibl to effect overcom the vietnames air forc and the indonesian navi we will maintain the initi throughout the fight when necessari we could also consid high speed surpris surgic strike focus on the countri themselv concentr on destroi their militari base in order to get them to compli principl of three dimension warfar we must organ a task forc of naval and air power for both offens and defens fight which can effect handl attack from the air or ocean dure the long trip so it could arriv at the combat zone without ani major problem sinc we ar weak in shipborn aircraft we could us the xisha and dongsha base to be respons for the primari air support mission the marin and the naval air forc would be the primari task forc for attack enemi occupi island and reef and the missil unit and air forc long rang bomber forc would becom the kei element for conduct firepow assault on the enemi at the same time dure the process of the fight it would alwai be necessari to make full us of camouflag decept and earli warn support measur principl of enhanc rear servic support prior to the fight it will be necessari to mobil suffici support vessel to join the task forc the xisha and dongsha island could becom intermedi tranship station for transport servic becaus the suppli line would be more than 1 000 km it will be especi import to us a larg amount of anti submarin and air defens forc in order to prevent the suppli line from be disrupt consider must be given to us a three dimension suppli rout of naval and air forc therefor the air forc must place a larg amount of it transport forc into servic in the combat stage of hold the recov island an uninterrupt suppli should be consid for build up the nansha island from far off us method of simultan develop solidifi and construct to gradual turn the south china sea into a perman ocean rout principl of rapid fight rapid stabil and strict control in order to prevent the situat from expand and the fight from escal especi to avoid japanes or us involv after the surpris attack ha been success we should quickli stabil the defens on the nansha island to form a three dimension defens system then everi effort should be made to disengag from the enemi announc an end to the fight in thi manner it will be possibl to concentr our best forc to establish a perman ocean channel how should the war be launch without an aircraft carrier what type of fight and what step might the chines forc us to accomplish their expedit to the nansha island accord to the idea us for numer long rang train flight by the south china sea air forc combin with the combat sequenc it is possibl to come up with a gener outlin of the fight composit of the task forc at the heart of the task forc will natur be the missil escort which have the greatest defens penetr capabl from a comparison of militari forc in the nansha island it would take at least five to eight of these with 10 to 15 escort ship 15 to 20 submarin 15 to 20 sub chaser 20 to 30 patrol boat three to five land ship 30 to 50 suppli support vessel and 50 to 100 missil launch it would take at least a week to assembl a task forc of thi size carri out an effect naval blockad while prepar to form the task forc at least 10 to 15 submarin and three to five long rang bomber squadron should conduct a blockad of the nansha island water to prevent to the greatest extent possibl ani reinforc of the island and reef and to make defens prepar difficult intermedi rang missil should constitut a threat to enemi vessel in the nansha island water electron countermeasur unit should carri out continu jam to confus the enemi make it possibl for the task forc to assembl and advanc undetect whether or not an effect three dimension blockad can be enforc over the nansha island is a kei link determin whether or not the element of surpris can be brought to bear in the fight thi process mai continu until the task forc ha deploi to certain water or even until the land combat ha begun the naval blockad will not be a tight blockad all around the nansha island but will be a blockad of the major ship channel and main ax not onli establish a blockad of the channel between vietnam the philippin and indonesia and the nansha island but also necessari assault against their land base along secondari direct a certain number of mine will normal achiev the object the kei to establish a naval blockad is that it reli on advanc surveil and monitor technolog the primari mean ar the us of satellit radar and reconnaiss aircraft to form a multipl layer surveil network which can provid real time guidanc to submarin and bomber aircraft to stop enemi transport if thi stage of the combat is successfulli organ it is veri possibl that no heavi fight will be necessari that the enemi mai be forc to accept condit or make concess avoid the final outbreak of war smoothli organ the advanc for a huge task forc to smoothli arriv at a combat zone more than 1 000 km awai is no easi task even if the naval blockad win the necessari time for the advanc and distract the enemi s attent to a great degre along the extend advanc rout there is no wai to ensur the task forc will not be attack from mani direct therefor for the chines task forc the fight begin with the advanc advanc and fight at the same time is a concept that must be establish by the task forc command dure the advanc the primari task of the task forc will be anti submarin and air defens worst estim ar that the enemi could us four or five submarin and 200 combat aircraft for the enemi these assault forc would mostli be us dure the advanc of the chines task forc although thi would not be a clear naval and air superior for the enemi it would constitut a fairli larg threat to the advanc task forc task forc ar usual divid into the spearhead main forc and rear guard stretch out over dozen of nautic mile with heavili expos flank which ar easili attack and without an aircraft carrier air defens would be even weaker in order to deal with thi the task forc advanc must us a number of support method first is enhanc firepow for the blockad of the nansha island suppress as much of the enemi naval and air forc in the nansha island as possibl second is the air forc fighter bomber should provid air cover for the fleet maintain control of the ski as much as possibl dure the advanc third the task forc must have and us enhanc anti submarin and air defens capabl from the firepow current avail to a task forc it is still possibl that it could handl enemi attack from the air and the sea luda class missil word indistinct ar equip with two launcher for ss n 2 anti ship missil two twin 130 mm ship gun eight 37 mm and eight 25 mm anti aircraft gun and two multipl rocket type depth charg launcher with rail which can hold 50 larg depth charg it ha fairli strong anti submarin defens capabl the jianghu class missil escort it is equip with two twin dual mount ss n 2 anti ship missil launcher four 100 mm and 12 37 mm anti aircraft gun two rocket type depth charg launcher and two anti aircraft missil launcher thi vessel ha better air defens capabl than cruiser the hainan class sub chaser thi is equip with two dual 57 mm and two dual 25 mm gun two rocket type mine launcher four mine rocket gun and mine launcher thi vessel is primarili us against submarin but ha a certain amount of air defens and ocean assault capabl the haidao class missil launch thi is equip with four ss n 4 anti ship missil and two dual 57 mm gun in addit the t 43 class mine sweeper the kronshtadt class patrol boat the huangfeng class and hekou class missil launch and the shanghai class ii model gunboat all have a certain degre of anti submarin capabl we can see from thi that dure the advanc the most reliabl wai to insur the advanc is effect task forc air defens and anti submarin firepow it is worth note that dure the fight the asean countri might receiv advanc us or western fighter and missil and even though these mai not be mani in number thei could be a sizeabl threat therefor organ the advanc might not be without snag if loss can be kept within 20 percent dure the advanc thi would be a major achiev launch an all out land campaign an effect blockad and a success advanc will greatli reduc the intens of land combat therefor the blockad itself must surround and assault the enemi forc hold the island so thei ar isol and without support at the same time when the task forc advanc to the specifi zone the enemi support vessel will have no time to worri about the defens hold the island these vessel mai make sacrifici defens against the task forc circl the forc or mai abandon the fight and go home in thi manner the task left to the land combat will primarili be wipe out the straggler left on the island as for the tactic to be us in the land what should be us is to surround larger forc and pursu smaller forc thi is to surround and wipe out the island and reef primarili defend by the vietnames allow the forc on the other smaller island and reef to escap leav them an avenu to escap so thei will withdraw quickli prior to the land combat the air forc and naval air forc and the task forc gun should conduct a firepow assault on the defens fortif and enemi personnel on the island for 40 to 60 minut the marin will await the opportun to penetr through breach in enemi defens into the interior of the island to critic posit execut separ and assault wait for the frontal land unit to enter the fight when the enemi defens system is basic demolish the overal battl to retak the island and reef is estim to take no more than two dai natur thi will primarili be determin by the effect of the blockad and success of the advanc and not by the land combat itself hold onto the nansha island is a big question mark just as in our earlier analysi a naval blockad and a success advanc and land combat would be necessari these three stage mai well all be success for china and we mai even be optimist for success howev recoveri of the lost territori is onli half of the nansha problem the other half is whether we hold onto them after we recov them becaus the task forc will not be abl to remain at the nansha island for a long period of time and it would not be practic to deploi larg number of troop to defend the variou island and reef of the nansha island and the nansha island ar locat in a pocket form by the other countri concern with the nansha question so thi all present a difficult problem for hold onto the nansha island as for the asean countri thei mai strateg fight a protract seesaw battl with china thi would be that when china s task forc goe south the troop would leav the island and not fight the task forc head on but when the task forc return back north thei would come back with china s current naval and air power it would not be abl to deal with such a situat the onli hope for turn thi question mark into an exclam mark is china s aircraft carrier
