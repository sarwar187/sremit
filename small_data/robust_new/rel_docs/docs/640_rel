FBIS3-46906: languag japanes articl type cso articl by hiroshi tanaka text declin popul a review of the futur of japan s economi reveal a big pile of seriou problem that can probabl caus a weak mind person to suffer a nervou breakdown let us deal with some of the repres problem the first problem is the conspicu declin in the birth rate and the number of birth dure the past 20 year ha been reduc from 2 million to 1 2 million peopl if the present low birth rate of 1 5 should continu the popul composit hereaft will suddenli shift in the direct of the ag and moreov the popul will begin to decreas about 20 year from now in the year after next the popul of the labor forc will begin to decreas and 25 year later the popul of the ag over 65 year will constitut 25 percent of the countri when the number of work peopl decreas it is onli natur for on to suppos that econom growth will stop at the same time the social secur expenditur will progress increas becaus of the increas in the popul of the ag and if the transposit is made with the present tax system intact the tax burden of the worker 30 year henc will like be about 70 percent at that time the old peopl s welfar will probabl be cut drastic and along with it a heavi consum tax will probabl have been introduc in order to equal the tax burden it seem like that the era in which everyon both young and old must lower the standard of live is about to be realiz in the not too distant futur there is no wai to protect against thi except either to increas the number of foreign worker or as quickli as possibl to return the birth rate from the present 1 5 to close to 2 1 sweden ha succeed in rais the birth rate from 1 6 to as much as 2 14 through such child care polici as grant matern leav with pai until the child is a year and a half old child care allow reduc work hour until the child is eight year old etc under thi system in sweden where by have just on of the two parent remain at home to babysit for a total of about two year on person who in the futur will work for 45 year between the ag of 20 and 65 will emerg and therefor thi is truli an advantag calcul from the standpoint of econom statist japan is a nation with an extrem high save rate but for the futur the number of young peopl who must shoulder japan s economi ha begun to decreas moreov with the increas in the popul of old peopl consumpt will increas more than save and therefor the save rate will unmistak shift to a declin if the work popul should decreas and the save rate should declin japan s economi will definit enter a degen stage lament of trade surplu the next problem is the expand trade surplu thi mean that the good produc through hard work by the japanes cannot be fulli util domest and have becom surplu good when compar with the middl class of the unit state and the former west germani the standard of live of the japanes is woefulli unequ the worker of the metropolitan citi ride overcrowd streetcar and commut from farawai small home for long hour no decent resort area ar found in their surround if the trade surplu were to be spent domest the standard of live of the japanes would improv spectacularli the trade surplu for last year wa about 130 billion if an equival amount of good were market domest it would be possibl to complet two tohoku bullet express railwai line and in addit to build seven seto grand bridg annual and even all the home in citi with a popul of a million peopl could be renov into mansion if wise invest a number of commut bullet express railwai line and a network of freewai can be built on the peripheri of the great metropolitan citi and it would probabl be possibl for everyon to commut from the larg residenti district locat within the nearbi countrysid and the idea of have the sewer system in all part of japan complet and the water in the river and lake purifi can be realiz in order to do so forc polici must be resort to such as restrict the privat ownership right of land or priorit it util if the object is for public us rais the cost of the privat ownership of land by levi a land tax with a uniformli heavi tax rate or reform the agricultur and fisheri industri still by rais the land tax rate the taxabl amount is not suppos to be high becaus land price will declin expans of the intern burden the third problem is japan s intern posit the cold war structur ha dissolv and the world ha begun to move furious toward the format of a new order for the unit state the object of strengthen it anti soviet anticommunist militari organ ha disappear and in it place the focu of it polici is laid on strengthen it econom power in order to prepar it strength to manifest it leadership under the new order the ill of the us economi have appear to be the two big deficit in financ and trade the clinton administr ha resolv to reduc the financi deficit by a total of 500 billion in the next five year it intend to accomplish thi by increas taxat of busi and the high incom bracket and through the reduct of militari expenditur and subsidi the reduct of financi deficit will produc a deflationari effect on the economi trade expans and reduct of import ar necessari in order to allevi thi effect the us govern is try to reduc the trade deficit with a strong determin at that time the on to becom the greatest target is japan which to the unit state is the countri with the greatest trade deficit at the recent us japan summit meet miyazawa reject presid clinton s request of make the ratio of the intern account surplu to the gnp below 5 percent in four or five year henc but regard the import industri field of automobil and their compon space industri equip etc thei appar agre to decid on the open market of the numer target valu of each on thi mean that regard the import field the japanes govern must assum the oblig of achiev the import object that have been decid on the unit state ha forc unfair control even against japanes busi but appar the japanes govern could not allud to them among the major unfair control ar the demand for self impos control on export to the unit state foreign invest control in the unit state polici of priorit the purchas of domest good place of origin control of ani busi advanc into the unit state forc the domest product ratio etc with the except of oil produc countri japan ha an expans export surplu in nearli all countri thi is true even with the unit state the unit state is try to prevent the increas of japan s export to the unit state is suppress the activ of japanes busi in the unit state and regard the import industri good is try to ensur a part of japan s market share japan s best plan in counter these effort is to expand the invest of the infrastructur such as transport citi home etc through the reform of the land system or the withdraw of variou control and therebi reduc the trade surplu but in realiti the plan is not possibl if the trade surplu cannot be reduc on a larg scale a balanc must be achiev by increas capit export by thi mean japan s oversea activ can be stimul and as japan s posit in the world expand then it intern respons on a compar basi will be demand regard the world s desir order for the futur japan must establish it world strategi under a clear vision endeavor in that direct and it must assum the econom burden for the abov reason at time the burden might becom a polit or militari on regrett the format of thi sort of vision is not possibl in todai s japan alreadi despit japan s intern posit be extrem high it doe not possess a world strategi despit the end of the cold war the us militari forc ar necessari for japan thi is becaus north korea might possess nuclear capabl in thi situat japan is compel to yield to the demand of the us govern if the worst happen thi situat might remain the same all through even hereaft will the japanes govern chang under these circumst come to think of it japan inde ha been plai a truli foolish role we japanes have reduc the number of children in our famili work faithfulli and as a result the good we have produc cannot be util to the fullest and ar export abroad and the peopl abroad through high qualiti japanes good have been enjoi a conveni life the foreign exchang deriv from these good is invest abroad and it ha serv to expand employ and improv incom begin with the east asian countri in the variou foreign countri the standard of live of the japanes peopl is realli not outstandingli high and yet japan ha disburs the largest amount of fund as oversea assist compar with the rest of the world japan donat 11 billion dure the persian gulf war despit all thi the fact is that japan is not respect by the world it appear that there ar more countri critic of japan the japanes peopl ar exasper but fortun the world ha chang recent and even the polit of japan appear to be chang as for the mechan that check the develop of japan s economi and the improv of the standard of live lower the birth rate and gave birth to the huge

FBIS4-42331: bfn articl by prime minist gro harlem brundtland under the perspect rubric our welfar state is not under threat in the eu text it is not surpris that in the debat on the eu european union too mani peopl rais question about what will happen to our social welfar arrang in the year to come thi is someth that ha a central place in our conscious and ha to do with our feel of secur the futur of the welfar state depend first and foremost on two thing our polit will to give prioriti to social welfar provis and our econom capac to meet their cost if eu membership had meant that we would weaken our welfar provis i would have been unabl to recommend norwegian membership we in norwai want to decid the shape of our welfar provis the system of social welfar payment the health servic the care of children and of the elderli whether we ar member of the eu or not the battl for the welfar state will be fought here at home as it alwai ha been the conserv parti s nation confer thi year gave advanc warn that the debat on the choic between a lighter tax burden and an activ welfar state on the size of the public budget and the scale of our social welfar provis is not a thing of the past social welfar polici will alwai depend on our own polit will to establish prioriti it is complet natur that social welfar polici is a nation concern eu cooper first and foremost cover area where there is a need for commit cooper across nation border area where joint decis must be reach decis which can best be taken nation or local should not be made at eu level the shape of welfar provis is close link to the individu countri s social structur and tradit decis in thi field need familiar first and foremost and a knowledg of the peopl who ar to benefit from the provis and thi requir a willing to show solidar and to work for a just distribut of resourc to the extent that the eu countri can be said to have a common polici in the social welfar field it is to prevent so call social dump it is import to prevent individu countri from us poor worker right to attract invest in the competit with the other member countri the work to counter social dump ha led among other thing to the fact that the eu ha told it member that thei must give at least 14 week of paid matern leav thi ha meant that some countri have had to increas their matern leav in most field norwai and mani of the countri that ar current member of the eu have better provis that the minimum standard for which the eu ha prepar the ground but thi doe not mean that either we or the other countri with better provis need to reduc our benefit even though we ar proud of our welfar model we ar not alon in europ in have a highli develop social welfar system the welfar state is a european invent the major of eu countri ar welfar state with a high level of social secur and a good degre of equal in live standard among the peopl in all european countri social welfar is found on the fact that the public sector ha taken respons even though the actual shape of the differ benefit provis differ somewhat from countri to countri nor is it the case that we here in norwai spend that much more monei on social welfar provis than do other european countri denmark and sweden us a larger share of their gross nation product on public spend eu member the netherland and franc ar more or less in line with us hot on our heel come belgium and greec inde greec spend a larger proport of it gross nation product on public consumpt that is what we normal call public servic than we do the fact that there is also variat between the differ social welfar model in the eu countri is due to the fact that social welfar polici is a nation affair the fact that spain spend a smaller share of it incom on public sector welfar provis than norwai doe is due to spain s histori and the polit choic spain ha made the fact that iceland which is not a member of the eu ha an even lower level of public spend than spain ha is also due to nation circumst tradit and prioriti it is therefor our own nation polit will which will decid the level of our public spend nevertheless the polit will is not enough on it own we ar also complet depend on our econom capac to meet the spend an activ social welfar polici requir here the same rule appli for norwai as it doe for everyon we cannot over a period of time spend more monei than we have we can borrow for a period but in the long run we can onli reli own our strength and the incom we succe in procur for ourselv the same appli to the welfar state we actual have to be abl to afford to pursu an activ social welfar polici thi is why the labori and demand work of put the norwegian economi to right ha been total necessari in order to guarante the futur of the welfar state we have first and foremost a nation respons to procur for our countri the incom need to guarante social welfar provis but our abil to procur thi incom is also link to our relat with the intern commun we ar entir depend on whether other countri ar will to bui our good as a small countri we ar especi depend on stabl intern econom condit eu membership will give us influenc in the cooper which will shape europ s futur and which will mean much for our econom develop whether or not we becom member of the eu in order to ensur the futur of the welfar state we also have to ensur an incom for the public sector there is noth in the eu rule on tax and duti harmon which is an obstacl to uphold the level of public budget on the contrari eu membership could be import when it come to uphold the fundament level of incom for the welfar state by give norwegian industri and commerc the growth stimulu that come from gain access to a market of 350 million peopl on the same term as our european competitor we ar lai the foundat for greater wealth creation and increas incom membership of the eu will make it more certain that we can afford to pai the bill for the welfar societi as a result it is not true as some peopl
