FBIS3-10878: languag spanish articl type bfn straight talk program with host carlo santana ojeda and guest osvaldo rodriguez from weekli juventud rebeld live text santana osvaldo ar there indic of an econom recoveri and if so in which sector ar these indic emerg at thi moment rodriguez well first i want to tell you carlo that straight talk ha alreadi made some predict for thi year 1994 for the begin of the year to be exact on make those predict we said that thi year 1994 wa the year when some symptom of econom recoveri would be emerg thei would be modest symptom as you said but recoveri after all at thi moment we cannot yet talk about econom reactiv i think we can onli talk about symptom of econom reactiv becaus so far some area which have been declin word indistinct of the steelwork industri sime which in 1993 announc that it manag to stop it declin and even manag to pick up somewhat but thi show that compar to 1992 there is a recoveri let us consid tourism tourism is todai the most stabl sector of our economi it is a sector that ha been grow on a yearli basi with net and gross incom i also think that tourism is have a domino effect on the rest of the economi why well becaus the tourism industri demand a number of resourc that the countri itself can suppli todai these resourc ar sought abroad thi forc the cuban economi to divert it merchandis toward tourism i wa also talk about the steelwork industri thi industri ha strong invest dedic exclus to tourism but not onli the steelwork industri agricultur must also seek strong invest and suffici product in order to meet all the need of tourism and in addit to thi there must be other servic such as launder dry clean water suppli system electr line etc all these thing ensur that the gross tourism incom is redistribut among the rest of the economi santana doe thi mean that you see tourism as the sector that is show sign of reactiv rodriguez well tourism in itself is a sector where santana interrupt i am ask thi question osvaldo becaus i would not mention tourism as a sector of reactiv but as a fulli consolid branch rodriguez well both thing it is a branch that is consolid itself but in relat to the nation economi grow tourism is a sign of econom reactiv becaus it is onli a sector which togeth with petroleum ha been expand all these past year includ these recent crisi year i am happi to rememb the case of petroleum becaus i have almost forgotten the effort made by the petroleum worker the fact that our countri extract 100 000 ton of petroleum last year is anoth symptom of the economi s reactiv but thi year the work be carri out with some foreign compani name through the so call risk contract must also begin yield result noth ha been announc so far but thei have been work for a littl more than a year look for petroleum santana suppos we have to make an anlysi of those sector which do you think is most respons for that econom reactiv or at least which do you think is the most import rodriguez well unquestion the sugar industri is the most import of all but the most repres of econom reactiv as i said befor is tourism i have explain the reason for thi and i am now go to explain why the sugar industri is the most import the sugar industri is what ha alwai maintain the cuban economi what ha yield the most import fruit both for the current foreign trade structur and for the previou structur when the socialist bloc wa still in effect when our most import sale to the world market includ to the cema market had been by the sugar industri the sugar industri seen in it broadest sens produc not onli sugar but also alcohol molass other byproduct such as bagass now the medicin the cattl feed and mani other product result from the sugar industri but todai we ar face an energi crisi in addit to the great crisi energi or the lack of petroleum is what ha led us to thi profound crisi cane ha therefor also becom our petroleum i think therefor that we must be care when deal with the sugar industri becaus the futur of cuba must be the sugar industri futur cuba cannot dream of a futur that is not the sugar industri even though we might find a larg petroleum deposit sugar will alwai be the sourc of all the thing i have mention santana ye sugarcan is consid the econom activ that can help us most under the current circumst howev is thi hope justifi rodriguez of cours there is the sugarcan recoveri program we have to keep in mind that our field have been highli exploit which make the soil lose it fertil it is therefor necessari to fertil the land us for sugarcan the lack of fertil first and the lack of herbicid second have result in a signific drop in sugarcan product thi hope is justifi becaus we ar veri serious work in the recoveri program todai the main goal of the basic cooper product unit ubpc is to restor sugarcan product to former level whenev sugarcan product is restor the harvest will of cours regain it rate which had been stabil at the 8 ton mark we have to return to that level of harvest santana you also spoke of the steelwork industri i am still not clear you spoke about thi industri in light of the import of product of equip for other industri rodriguez for other industri paus the steelwork industri is capabl of build mill and also mani other type of equip it is capabl of manufactur pump signific invest ar be made thi industri put out a consider amount of electr and telephon cabl it is also a great provid of spare part it is a tremend produc of steel not onli carbon steel but also stainless steel which is now produc in cuba i believ that the potenti of thi industri which ha taken year to shape thi is not someth done overnight is mark by the special of it worker technician and engin thi allow us to us thi industri to develop the countri and also as a sourc of export santana onc again on tourism i understand that cuban tourism ha perform favor in term of intern market in recent month is thi true what do you know about it rodriguez ye i have read about thi issu i believ it is veri interest that cuba is alreadi be seen extens by tourist in the caribbean basin it is predict that by the end of the centuri the caribbean will be the world s top spot for tourism cuba is not compet with mani caribbean island todai there ar veri small caribbean island perhap slightli larger than the isl of youth that welcom 1 million tourist we ar begin to develop we began tourism late we must rememb that it is difficult to reduc that distanc of cours we must keep the us blockad in mind the greatest number of cruis ship in the caribbean and around cuba transport approxim 8 million tourist ar base in miami these ar american busi the blockad ban all those ship although thei skirt everi cuban coast without touch cuban port thi undoubtedli affect us serious i believ that despit thi tourism is arriv we have mani european particularli german and canadian as heard tourist latin american tourism is also begin to increas i believ that thi will fulfil those predict that cuba will welcom 1 million tourist santana in what measur is thi reactiv the result of the open to certain foreign capit invest on on hand and on the other the result of the increas in our product and qualiti in the econom effort base on effici and control rodriguez i believ it is a combin of all these thing the foreign capit invest ha allow us first of all to access market access technolog and capit thi is the case with tourism we said that tourism is on of the model industri of thi reactiv foreign capit not onli form part of the tourism industri it also plai a role in reactiv other import industri within cuba i believ thi ha plai a role undoubtedli the increas awar of cuban worker better yet the collect of the need to perform more effici work better and even come to believ that the product must be consum immedi and not be produc to be store awai and with poor qualiti becom awar of all these thing ha result in higher effici which todai cannot yet be seen in ani plan becaus the cuban economi ha just complet the process of declin santana how can we guarante the sound of that reactiv be experienc rodriguez first of all we have to consolid the cuban economi on the basi of our nation structur to defend what is our to advoc the best possibl us of our resourc and learn to work with high level of effici econom and us true econom control there is no need to think that a foreign is need to teach thi to us i believ we have foreign here teach us veri interest thing but we can also make our own contribut becaus when you speak with worker thei know quit well what need to be done santana we have discuss macroeconom issu when will the reactiv be felt at home rodriguez first of all in term of nutrit i believ thi is the first thing that the peopl ar expect we speak of symptom and even some comrad have smile and said symptom with the need we have todai i have had to explain that the econom reactiv ha to take place befor the domest part of the economi will feel the reactiv the first problem at home is food i believ we have to solv thi first in what measur can thi be solv well thi is perhap a subject for anoth program secondli we need to satisfi a varieti of primari need becaus thi crisi ha result in the lack of mani thing we could make an endless list of household item we need to provid these ar perhap not vital for tackl tomorrow but ar vital to the life of ani civil individu todai

more with the presid of the parliament in realiti to discuss the kind of issu with the peopl chang thought it is still to be seen the first case of a countri where the famou packag of measur ar implement and someon ha the brilliant idea of discuss it with the worker santana i have never seen the imf or world bank suggest such a thing alarcon even less ask the worker s opinion befor adopt measur thi also help to creat a mind set the peopl get to express themselv and might becom convinc of on possibl or anoth which might not be the most appropri at a certain moment first of all the anpp and thi ha been acknowledg in dispatch by sever foreign new agenc which i have read discuss inform on the cuban economi that is usual handl with more discret and thi wa broadcast from coast to coast to the entir popul inform such as the size of the deficit the subsidi etcetera and unpaid account wa discuss openli thi is the opposit of the practic of famou parliament which perhap meet for three month with an overabund of speech but where the inform is not handl as openli to me thi is veri import i said thi in the anpp meet and other comrad also said that other parliament do not openli discuss packag of measur but thei do so with the millionair thei do so with the great power of the economi of those countri it might be that the union will not even find out until thei read the paper it might be that certain legisl ar in the dark about the packag of measur that ar go to be promulg howev those who truli control the economi in those countri ar made awar and agreement ar reach with them in our case we would have to do it backward our millionair ar the worker the peopl also even in order to discuss and thi can be done possibl measur which perhap ar not pleasant or well seen by a sector of the popul as heard santana alarcon i find it interest that thi process of consult involv onli the worker howev there ar sector of the popul such as housew retire and student who also have their opinion on probabl measur to mend the economi what is the anpp plan to do to includ these opinion alarcon we also have to think about the other sector of the popul howev there ar sever basic reason why thi process began with the labor movement first of all becaus it relat directli to product and servic thi is the core of the econom problem second becaus the union movement in our societi ha to plai it proper role the union movement is the vanguard of societi it is the class that ha to exert it hegemoni it leadership becaus of the concret experi of the meet which i have attend and the on i have been told about by other comrad i know thei ar yield specif result that can begin to have an effect right now to improv the nation financ pictur of cours when we speak of workplac thi also includ educ center we have includ the youth student teacher of that sector i believ that in a later phase we have to see how to attain through the peopl s council the particip of other sector of the popul not organ in union bel deputi who belong to a workplac also ar found in peopl s council and can be of aid in the discuss at that level recio i believ all cuban must be quit clear on thi we must reach a consensu on that no measur can as you mention earlier solv the nation problem right awai in other word thei ar not a magic wand or a magician s hat a measur is implement and the problem is solv in other word these ar measur we have to necessarili adopt to solv part of the problem certain measur have alreadi been taken you mention an essenti on now regard the financi unbal there is an opinion out there i have had to discuss it howev i would like you to speak about it some sai that if these measur have to be taken we ar alreadi late thei argu that thi process of collect discuss is a delai that unnecessarili protract the implement of measur which will help solv our problem i would like you to explain why thi is not a wast of time alarcon i believ it is necessari for exampl the budget deficit if an organ or enterpris is ineffici in other word it cost more monei to the peopl than what it contribut word indistinct thi is veri simpl close it down howev if in the budget of an organ expens surpass incom thei have to reduc expens to match incom under capit thi is solv quit simpli how mani surplu worker ar there how mani enterpris ar you go to close down etcetera is it not a measur discuss the situat of the enterpris factori or institut with it worker so that among them with the data at hand with the same open with which the inform on the nation economi wa disclos thei can discuss and understand what need to be done in case there is no other altern but to take certain measur that affect them what measur can thei the worker the owner of the societi adopt to mend their financ to reduc cost and make their work more ration thi is why i sai that thi discuss process is an extrem import measur or a total of veri import measur we hope will be adopt throughout cuba on the other hand i believ that it is somewhat simplemind if you were to sai that by implement thi measur from the top begin tomorrow the situat will begin to chang we ar not sit on our hand think about measur on the contrari thei ar be adopt for exampl we mention the ubpc but there is self employ and even the famou decrimin of foreign currenc these ar measur that also effect the nation financ but which by definit did not requir a process of consult of increas the awar of the peopl as soon as we understood how to implement them we did it even befor the anpp met there ar cooper that ar cost less than a state farm in certain place that have attract worker in other word there ar healthi sign and have reduc cost there ar concret result you can see nobodi ha refrain from implement measur that ar clearli defin measur that have clear and immedi implic what is import here is to elev the moral of the worker fidel point out that work is attain through pride honor well we have to appeal to that pride and honor and consolid them in specif measur to be taken at each place thi is on of the most import thing that can be done thi would not be base on that famou packag of measur but would be base on someth we can do here and cannot be done elsewher to appeal to the worker and frankli discuss with them all these problem specif call them by their right name and not us gener term recio i would like to ask alarcon about an issu base on the experi other countri have had when thei mix these two concept democraci and the economi it is known that in most of the countri implement neoliber formula of econom reorgan and readjust democraci the function of democraci is hamper in mani case and there ar sad regret event howev base on alarcon s word on the previou program democraci in cuba the develop of our democraci could be a forc to possiblyt help the economi recov i would like alarcon to tell us about thi issu alarcon thi ha to be develop to it fullest extent i have seen in some assembl chang thought for exampl in term of the two issu of the greatest import in thi societi the surplu administr personnel of worker not directli link to product and the problem of lack of control which result in lost resourc crime etcetera we can find place such as i have seen in some of these meet where the worker ar of the opinion that there is surplu administr personnel sometim thi is the result of our method mechan still in effect which i believ we have to elimin or chang at time we demand much unnecessari inform or work which impli repetit of work mechan at the base level thi gener bureaucrat posit in a factori there might be need of product work a space for those adminsitr worker it is not a matter of throw anyon on the street i am think about the specif case of la corona factori where we discuss these issu with the worker on 12 januari on the other hand although at time we have an excess of administr mechan which ar there to exert control it is evid that control is not on the best function thing in our societi there ar wai too mani problem in thi area in that meet the worker state that the union and worker should and ought to plai a much more import activ role if the organ worker discuss thing collect and democrat and establish specif principl and work standard thei can replac a bureaucrat mechan not onli that thei can implement a much more effect mechan in term of real control and commit disciplin and more definit order now i believ that besid all of thi our countri ha confront a difficult situat a situat of blockad of confront the abrupt chang in our foreign trade relat the thing we know shape the special period likewis the countri attempt to resist these setback and to develop while preserv that which i believ reflect the broadest nation consensu i do not think anyon here is crazi enough to wish for a return to privat medicin no on here is crazi enough to hope for cuba to have the situat of the richest capit countri the unit state where todai thei ar debat if 40 million american ar final go to have some degre of paid medic coverag paid becaus not even in their dream can american conceiv of free medic care if social did not exist could ani cuban conceiv of the barestl possibl of uphold such a vital accomplish which is reflect in the low infant and matern mortal rate and a number of thing which ar truli dear to most peopl could anyon be simplemind enough to imagin thi would exist in cuba if our social did not exist evid not the same can be said of educ elder care and our entir social secur system to preserv all that to save all thi requir the effort and sacrific of all we have to turn thi hope into a daili thing the struggl for these hope ha to becom a real daili perman thing thi can onli be done with the support of the peopl thi is not go to be the result of decis or conclus reach by a sharp well intend etcetera group of peopl thi requir the understand and support of the entir popul of worker of cuba thi is why i believ thei ar insepar howev given our type of democraci and the condit cuba face it is not onli a matter of principl but a philosoph reason which should be our polit hope to perfect our polit system thi is the onli possibl strategi to realli maintain the mobil and struggl of a peopl who have resist heroic and have ampli proven that thei will be abl to confront and overcom thi entir challeng cavada a question in connect with thi idea and even that of the parliament in the work place at the begin mani perhap might have thought that a tobacco worker such as you mention from la corona or perhap a metallurgi industri worker could not give hi opinion and decid or propos thing for the economi or the futur economi of cuba howev i believ that in the practic it ha been differ thi is proven by anoth of our accomplish in the last 35 year the educ level of the peopl i also wa at the tobacco factori on 12 januari and it wa truli impress to hear a tobacco worker in charg of the tobacco refriger unit speak of the law of valu analyz scientif what it entail to increas product what product to increas which to decreas and even cite how harm element in other countri collect the excess currenc thi is why i think it is a veri healthi and logic practic on the part of the ctc and the anpp to summon an extens debat what limit or point might it reach how much longer might thi involv of the peopl last after the special session of the anpp alarcon i believ we must continu it i believ that present it is directli ti to these issu but it is also part of the process of perfect our system of govern i believ that the ctc ha to plai a kei role it should be maintain as a practic system and as a method of manag organ and control the effect real particip of the worker in the economi is consubstanti with a socialist democraci i do not believ that in thi or in the case of the peopl s council we have reach perfect or anyth like it thi is why we speak of perfect thi is a continu process of seek how to do thing better you gave a great exampl that of the comrad in charg of the tobacco refriger unit unfortun it would have been surpris to find such an exampl in cuba sever gener ago howev thi is now common everywher we have a peopl much more highli educ a cultur peopl a peopl readi to exert further their right and social function their activ role in societi sexto i want to chang the focu from perfect the system these measur be discuss nation ar to solv immedi problem such as the excess currenc financi unbal etcetera ar these measur not also part of a necessari effort to correct our economi can we speak of polit correct without speak of econom correct alarcon i believ that we have said it sever time thei ar deepli interrel i believ that first of all we cannot separ the economi from polit we have a socialist perspect the struggl particularli in a blockad countri a countri with our difficulti or even without those difficulti to build a socialist societi a societi base on equal justic and fratern also ha a materi econom dimens thi mean a need to produc more good and to provid a higher qualiti of life to the peopl but abov all to fulfil a group of ideal ethic aspir which have to do with the conscienc the conscienc we effect polit i believ that although we ar highli involv in the reorgan of our financ the econom struggl in gener and in confront the special period these mechan these method ar not design for thi struggl alon their effect and lifespan should not be limit to thi period i am convinc we ar go to surpass the special period i am convinc that we ar go to put our financ in order that we ar go to successfulli resist thi phase and make progress we will also continu make progress in the perfect of our polit system which is also essenti in order to continu the econom develop and the develop of a socialist economi and societi sexto on what do you base the hope that we ar go to surpass the special period that we ar go to overcom thi entir situat alarcon i do not want to sound overconfid or anyth like that howev without stress the essenti need to continu struggl hard chang thought i said thi to the deputi when i wish them a happi new year thi relat to marx s famou quot happi is the struggl i told the deputi i wish for all of us to continu struggl unit and hard i believ it is not a wast of time to valu the feat of our peopl for four year we have been live in a world where all it expert vainli predict our death these also have been veri difficult year where we have had to rethink a number of thing seek new market and abruptli reorgan our economi on complet differ base i believ as hard as the problem ar there is someth we cannot forget these four year have demonstr our peopl s capabl to resist we cannot deni that there ar peopl who mai have weaken that is what the entir crimin polici of the yanke the whole blockad seek thei seek to attract peopl tear awai certain sector of the popul from the patriot and unit attitud the immens major of the peopl uphold i believ that our peopl s uniqu show of resist is truli signific in the last four year sever govern have collaps under less dramat condit that those face by the cuban govern thei have fallen like a hous of card there have been mani chang in the world even peopl with frustrat and lost illus who now wish for the social of certain european societi there have been great chang in the world and thi small countri locat in the worst of place is the onli socialist countri that is far awai from the former socialist bloc and too close to the empir yet here we ar and it is even possibl to discern sign of progress amidst thi crisi tourism is grow in cuba tourism is grow at on of the highest rate in the world if not the highest the accomplish we have attain in certain field amidst such an advers situat cannot be ignor i believ that in the measur that that spirit that will is channel organ and boost we have the possibl of show modest limit sign of the begin of a recoveri in 1994 on exampl is the sugarcan harvest there is the real possibl that thi year s harvest will be more effici than last year s and a littl higher in term of volum of product the sugarcan harvest categor prove wrong those who believ imagin and much wa said abroad that cuba wa inexor go downward for us it is an essenti highli signific thing to take thi step with the limit resourc cuba will receiv but also becaus it confirm the righteous of the effort we all ar conduct mani other exampl could be given the entir scienc sector scientif research biotechnolog the pharmaceut industri etcetera step by step despit all the obstacl and the immens competit with the transnat in thi sector some of our product ar make headwai becaus thei ar uniqu and also becaus thei ar us and effect and our product capac ha grown and all thi take place amidst a truli difficult situat these ar the element for a justifi optim sexto on quick question i can see that your cautiou optim is base on the capabl for resist and work of the peopl but i also believ that you trust the strategi that cuba is follow to overcom thi in the success of thi strategi alarcon of cours i am cautiou in term of the concret result we might see i am total and complet confid in the correct of our strategi and the capabl for resist and work of our peopl bel in all these ongo debat and in the peopl s mouth there ar highli gener term such as subsidi tax confisc etcetera you spoke of the need to work on the conscienc of the citizen of act polit ar there plan to provid new program to contribut to organ the think of the mass in thi regard alarcon i believ that in thi we all have to contribut with our grain of sand i believ that what the union do what we ar try to do in the peopl s govern what you do in the press is us everi mean to reach mani peopl and serv as tool for reflect and analysi by the comrad i believ that we have to see these thing as issu on which we all have to becom educ collect by confront opinion view in the search for element etcetera these ar issu that in anoth countri would be the exclus realm of the intellectu the expert or the power in our case the same thing happen the owner have to decid on the issu but here all of us ar the owner we have to assum thi role fulli i believ thi is not easi thi is not a simpl issu thi is why i answer posit when i wa ask earlier about the relationship between the economi and polit after the special period and the present financi situat i believ that in a societi such as thi everi worker should aspir to becom a connoisseur of detail of cost of effici and of all the econom field which ar not the respons alon of the manag hire by an owner those peopl manag veri well to keep their enterpris run effici becaus thei sought someth call profit we do not have thi now there is no on profit from our sweat therefor we have to be more creativ on how we assum the role of owner of owner in a more nobl sens more open and includ the entir peopl thi is veri complex it is not a matter of becom specialist in a limit fiield of action i believ that it is also veri import to develop a collect awar in societi recio it is go to be on year sinc the elect of 1993 a highli signific moment in the histori of democraci in cuba and cuban histori itself alarcon is perhap the best person to answer the follow question a year ha gone by is that overwhelmingli majoritarian support of social the revolut and the fatherland still there a year later what chang have taken place in the awar of the peopl who did not understand well enough the essenc of those elect and it result alarcon i deepli believ so i believ that in the measur that time goe by thi cultiv educ peopl understand even more that what is at stake is the defens of social which is everyth for us even our nation ident the possibl of the exist of thi land as a sovereign and independ nation is insepar from the project of social justic which the cuban peopl have undertaken i believ thi is the explan of what we comment on earlier why our peopl have resist so hard for four year of the special period while other have not regard the second question we will of cours alwai have detractor and thi honor us the dai those who live in a pseudodemocraci in a societi that us term as nobl as thi on to disguis the opposit to hide the lack of equal and therefor the lack of the real author of the peopl over it govern see our system as praiseworthi would be reason enough for us to conduct a self examin to find out what ar we do wrong i believ that in the polit aspect in gener the defens of cuba s revolutionari project is grow each dai throughout the world becaus it is precis an altern as long as there is a countri which confront with immens challeng maintain aliv ideal which for mani peopl ar but dream of a more nobl world a world base on equiti justic fratern rather than profit exploit and individu selfish which is capit as long as thi exist there is a threat to peopl who exploit and discrimin in thi world as all thi keep the peopl s dream aliv in the polit sens thi should be reflect more each dai in a system of govern that is genuin truli and authent of the peopl on that is realli participatori i believ that despit the enemi campaign thi is a concept that continu to becom more deepli root continu to progress i mention the other dai an italian friend who saw someth he cannot do in hi countri here it can be done and will be done more and better each dai precis becaus we have a just societi and a peopl awar and capabl of sustain and preserv that societi a peopl who have a great revolut made by the peopl and worthi of the peopl recio there is on more question a special session of the anpp ha been announc what is expect of thi special session when will it be held alarcon it will be held at the appropri time here i am return to the diplomat languag of my previou job laughter i believ that it will happen earli in the year the session should reflect what wa decid in decemb the continu of that discuss which i am sure will be held under better condit with more prepar more in depth analysi accompani much more by the peopl as a result of thi process in which the peopl ar particip i believ it will be held at a time when we ar more on the offens the peopl ar not onli talk about financ but thei ar act on them everywher across the land at the time the anpp meet is held i am sure that thi process by the union and anpp deputi and deleg will have attain much more dynam and strength and thi will be reflect in the anpp meet

by april bring correspond price rise but as m sub 1 growth for august 1992 wa down to 19 7 percent it is estim that thi began to impact 1993 price in the second quarter of cours suppos that fourth quarter m sub 1 growth did not rebound too sharpli to jump to about 30 percent with price not fall then the linkag between m sub 1 and price wa even tighter as to reform dynam by the end of 1992 our

commod price were market regul it could be said that our commod price reform wa basic complet such a larg reform dynam wa bound to impact futur price but as the price reform dynam weaken the lag effect will also abat bring less market price pressur 2 the differ between market price and commod consumpt elast and consumpt structur wa link to the result differ in the commod price rise structur on on hand consum good consumpt elast differ bring vari price rise when consumpt elast is larg rise price lower purchas volum but when consumpt elast is small price rise do not bring sharp chang in purchas volum as demand remain rel stabl basic constant most of the faster rise price were for commod or servic with less consumpt elast which whether suppli and demand were balanc rose as much as state polici rise for instanc as grain water and power and ga were all indispens to daili life or replac onli on a small scale onc the govern rais price their price went up too in the first three quarter basic necess price rose about 20 percent with the impact of price rise for food commod alon account for over 50 percent of overal price rise just the opposit price rise were lower for commod with greater flexibl includ popular good of depend qualiti such as ordinari cloth and articl for daili us for which price rise were mostli under 8 percent with some even fall let thi be a warn to

as incom rose consumpt grade also went up with attent to watch higher market price rise for expens commod new product new design and new style such as name brand color tv and dress fashion show the impact of high consumpt by the high incom strata make on feel that price were chang and rise sharpli these two factor reflect cost drive as well as demand pull 3 the rmb wa sharpli devalu the exchang

20 percent from septemb to octob by the end of novemb lose enterpris had expand further to 37 3 percent our overal effici improv wa clearli fall with increas loss while thi wa caus partli by new financi system in certain enterpris as well as by other factor the weaken of the speed and price rise type effici wa also a kei factor c our econom develop imbal remain glare with no clear structur adjust progress 1 our region develop imbal further sharpen with our eastern region s product construct consumpt and incom growth clearli higher than in our midwest region and the coastal interior gap continu to widen for the first three quarter coastal zone product construct and consumpt growth account for over 60 percent of our nation growth 2 our industri develop imbal remain glare while we reap better agricultur harvest with grain and edibl oil output set new record the enterpris lack of stamina did not improv with the imbal between industri and agricultur still exist still no great improv in our suppli shortag of transport power and kei raw materi and bottleneck industri limit still troubl nation econom develop 3 our urban rural incom distribut imbal grew more sever while rural incom grew slowli with rural market realiz remain low our urban resid had not yet broken free from the big pottism set so were continu to eat out of the two big pot of the state and enterpris take advantag of all sort of dexter mean to squeez out public interest which gave them sustain high incom growth to sharpen the gap with rural resid 4 our intern payment imbal sharpen export grew slowli on on hand while import increas quickli on the other make our trade imbal more evid and make 1993 our first year of trade deficit sinc 1990 our trade deficit for the first 11 month of 1993 top 7 billion and without effect control will increas further meanwhil our export earn rate wa low with our import payment rate high reduc the amount of foreign exchang that the state could amass and pose a new threat to our mainten of the necessari foreign exchang reserv these mani imbal show that our econom system and oper forc remain obvious irrat while these imbal mai not have a sharp short term impact on our overal econom develop thei ar still a hidden peril that might touch off nation econom instabl so if we do not elimin them promptli but rather let them grow thei ar like to have an advers impact on china s econom develop as well as have a neg effect on our social stabil iii thought on macroeconom regul and control polici measur for the next stage as to the current state of our econom oper we need to pai attent to prevent two deviat a impati to make our high econom growth and price rise fall back by take step to increas our overal regul and control dynam instead of make a structur monetari adjust which might caus our economi to cool down too quickli and lose us the chanc for stabl growth b overemphasi on enterpris problem instead of an appropri eas of our overal regul and control dynam particularli by make credit too easi which might affect our econom soft land to set off anoth econom overh so we hold that our gener 1994 econom principl should be to consolid our overal regul and control success expand our structur adjust dynam sharpli rais our econom effici continu to rectifi our econom order and go all out to intensifi all reform our overal 1994 econom plan should remain as set forth in 1993 in central document 6 gdp growth rate and price rise both under 10 percent with a correspond fix asset invest scale of 1 4 trillion yuan up about 20 percent from 1993 s estim figur with the rough growth of real work volum at about 8 percent retail consum good sale growth remain around 20 percent loan scale control at 500 billion yuan currenc issu control at 150 billion yuan and monei suppli in the narrow sens m sub 1 growth rate control at about 25 percent export growth maintain at approxim 10 percent essenti balanc with import the ratio between overal suppli and demand control at under 5 percent in order to keep our economi grow at an appropri rate while further control inflat we hold that our macroeconom regul and control in the next stage should pai attent to grasp the follow area 1 we need to appropri grasp our regul and control dynam gener while the three month of macroeconom regul and control of our economi sinc juli 1993 have essenti stabil our macroeconom oper bring some improv to our overal relat between suppli and demand we ar still not on an essenti normal track with our 1993 ratio of demand exceed suppli probabl still higher than the
