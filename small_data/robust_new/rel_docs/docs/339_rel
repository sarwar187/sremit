affair there is onli on rout to master on of the five kei technolog of the futur world market comput biotechnolog space technolog new form of energi and new materi of these technolog the most import sai noam chomski is biotechnolog to thi opinion of the german strategist should be ad a second condit for admiss or perman membership in the first world be an independ state with suffici autonomi and polit determin in deal with the major world power center to defend a develop project base on nation interest in light of both of these paramet the futur of the latin american countri appear dismal with the except of costa rica which is not repres of latin america cuba is the onli countri that meet these two requisit and therefor the onli on with a good probabl of leav underdevelop behind the real independ of the cuban state requir no further demonstr and of these five technolog of the futur cuba is now on of the world leader with the unit state in the on that is most import biotechnolog and genet engin by the year 2000 thi market will have a volum of 200 billion and cuba will domin a larg part of it the follow report present a summari of numer interview with director of cuban biomed and biotechnolog institut and provid the most extens account that ha yet been publish abroad on the spectacular advanc made by the cuban biotechnolog school thi lack of inform is not due to ani cuban clamp down on the flow of inform but instead to the virtual censorship of report of ani success of the cuban process a censorship that prevail in almost all of the western commun media aid vaccin as in other laboratori all over the world cuba is also do intens work on the scourg of aid that accord to who world health organ estim ha to date afflict 12 million peopl in mani countri it is now on of the lead caus of death in mexico it wa in fourth place in 1991 the cuban biotechnolog school s battl against aid is be wage on three front the develop of a vaccin against the viru the design of accur and inexpens diagnost system for massiv us in blood bank and with the popul and develop medic to treat opportunist infect that is diseas that occur becaus of the aid induc weaken of the immun system the cigb genet engin and biotechnolog center is on of the most import center work to develop an aid vaccin in a 62 000 squar meter facil near havana over 600 scientist most of whom ar young produc 160 differ product 30 of them develop through genet engin it scientif staff ha expertis in all of the modern methodolog necessari includ genet engin molecular biologi and immunolog and advanc biochemistri and it ha the most advanc research and product hardwar in the world as reveal by an inspect tour of it lab and industri facil dr manuel limonta the director of the institut and of it scientif board state cuba will have an aid vaccin by 2000 or earlier he sai thei have a work group that is develop a vaccin against aid us genet engin technolog to prevent the diseas thi is a strong group which ha alreadi been work on thi program for a long period of time and the group ha produc signific result limonta did not describ these signific result but from other sourc we deduc that thei have manag to isol and character the specif viral strain respons for hiv and that thei ar now in the laboratori test phase the cigb director express confid that thei will manag to bring aid under control immunolog and state categor we ar go to develop a vaccin dieterich steffan befor the french or american do limonta i do not know if it will happen befor but i believ it mai be befor 2000 that is my person belief i think it mai be earlier than that or it mai be around that time that is my view of the matter if it were not dr limonta make thi pronounc it might appear somewhat rash but limonta is a heavyweight in thi field and hi person achiev and those of the institut he direct lend author to hi assert in support of thi the director of the cnic nation center for scientif research dr carlo gutierrez sai that limonta and hi team practic live in their lab when thei ar try to solv someth thei ar extraordinarili dedic to the work thei ar do and if thei make such a statement thei ar capabl of do it he recal their achiev with interferon as an exampl when limonta work with a small team of young research propos produc interferon in cuba peopl were talk of a minimum time frame of three to four year thei did it in 42 dai a truli record time as everyon recogn on the lengthi list of the success of the cigb and it director mani achiev in close collabor with other cuban scientif institut there ar nearli 160 differ product that have been develop by the cigb includ about 30 produc through genet engin from start to finish these ar recombin product to convei an idea of what thi mean dr limonta explain that in what is known as the third world cuba is the onli countri that ha develop from start to finish product through the us of genet engin which ar known and regist product and which ar export such product have not been develop in ani of the other countri even in countri that ar much larger than cuba like china or india just in 1993 the us patent and trademark offic in washington regist three patent for the cigb by so do it recogn the origin of the product and that cuba is the onli countri with the technolog and the methodolog to produc them it also recogn that the qualiti of these product meet the food and drug administr standard the most stringent in the world and grant cuba the exclus right to produc and sell these product in us territori for 17 year these product includ a prevent medic for myocardi infarct call estreptoquinasa regist as no 07 703 778 the first vaccin for mening bc develop anywher in the world 07 754 918 and the invertas sucros enzym which convert sugar into fructos for estreptoquinasa cuba with the except of on us firm is the onli countri that ha produc thi medic sai limonta he explain that thi product can dissolv clot in coronari arteri thi medicin is capabl of elimin clot in a high percentag of patient when it is administ immedi after the infarct and it prevent the infarct from progress so it act as a prevent for myocardi infarct the patent registr for thi product ha alreadi been appli for in over 40 countri thei ar go to grant it for we know that we ar the onli on who have develop an origin process to make thi medic get a patent of thi type reflect the high technolog capabl of our institut in thi case the technolog is genet engin studi of the drug produc in the unit state have demonstr that it biolog effect is similar to that of the cuban product howev the cuban medic is much cheaper than the us drug estreptoquinasa wa also develop in record time from the time when the idea wa first conceiv until the product wa regist as a medic onli four year elaps on the averag in cuba product ar develop in less time than in us and japanes compani we have a studi done by us and japanes scientist that sai that we ar 1 3 time more product than thei ar in term of the time requir to complet a product and put it to us while compli with all the legal requir in practic thi higher product coeffici mai mean for exampl that a us or japanes product which requir 10 year for research and product mai be develop in seven year in cuba the explan offer by the cuban scientist for such a surpris phenomenon is complex but thei all agre that the educ and scientif philosophi of the revolut of which these young peopl ar the result is the kei factor anoth spectacular success of the cigb is what is known as nerv growth factor which is still not known elsewher in the world sai limonta becaus nobodi els ha been abl to develop it thi medic a protein is us to regener nervou system damag and it could also be us in a diseas like alzheim s the product ha now enter the industri product phase which will enabl it to be us in clinic trial genet alter anim and plant anoth line of research the cigb is pursu is the genet modif of anim and plant to date thei have produc transgen mice rabbit and fish their goal is now to produc a genet alter cow limonta explain that in these anim a new trait or genet inform is introduc in the fertil ovum which the anim assimil as it own and transmit hereditarili in thi wai genet chang can be produc and new speci can even be creat the specif object is to make mammal milk in thi case cow s milk also produc medic the cow is an excel milk produc laboratori if we can introduc in thi laboratori the intellig enabl it in addit to milk to also produc specif protein then we could have for exampl interferon product in cow it all seem quit simpl we would not need a complex and costli industri interferon product process which requir the us of ferment equip close monitor etc the entir process would be done sole in the anim we would extract the product from the milk and the milk would then be us normal dieterich steffan that sound like scienc fiction limonta ye but it is go to happen i am absolut sure of it we have alreadi done it we have obtain medic in rabbit milk dieterich steffan do intern specialist know thi limonta the on who read intern public do first we did thi with mice to test the methodolog then we us rabbit to improv the methodolog and produc medic that wa again success and now we ar work to produc medic in larger anim in cow we have not done that yet but we ar go to growth hormon manuel limonta also discuss the cigb progress in the control and us of growth hormon we have work on fish and in thi area we realli have on of the most advanc group in the world we introduc the genet inform contain in the growth hormon in fish thi caus the fish to grow veri rapidli thei do not reach a larger size than normal but thei do so more quickli becaus thei incorpor their food better the time save can be half or an even larger percentag compar with the normal growth period the fish in thi case tilapia a carp ar still not reproduc in larg quantiti but the fundament step ha been taken in the field of anim health thei have creat for the first time anywher in the world a vaccin against cattl tick for which the patent is now be regist in brazil argentina mexico and other countri the develop of a vaccin against porcin colibacillosi a diseas whose mortal rate among newborn pig is 100 percent is anoth notabl scientif achiev at the present time a more advanc version of thi vaccin is be develop in the area of plant health the us of biotechnolog ha result in the increas of plant resist to specif pest a transgen tobacco ha been produc which resist the manduca septa moth an insect that destroi the tobacco leaf with thi genet modif the moth is kill without damag the leaf thi is accomplish without alter the plant s characterist a potato that is resist to on of the three type of viru that affect it seed is anoth cigb achiev thei ar now work to develop resist against the other two thei have also produc a genet alter cabbag with a moth resist gene thei have also develop a transgen sugarcan the first time in the world that a genet alter sugarcan ha been develop to have a sugarcan that is more resist to some pest other achiev on of the cigb big achiev is the recombin vaccin against hepat b which is now us in over 20 countri in cuba it is given to all newborn as part of a nationwid program anoth complet new product now regist in cuba and some other countri but which is still not avail on the market is skin growth factor which is us to treat burn some other import product includ human monoclin antibodi for treatment and in the industri area new enzym on of these enzym is invertas sucros which transform sugar into fructos when fructos is us to sweeten or to improv flavor the amount of sugar need is reduc by 20 to 30 percent the method and technolog us for it industri applic ar exclus cuban against aid on the second front against aid it diagnosi cuba ha three differ techniqu the first wa develop by the aid research laboratori the second by the cigb and the third by the cie immunoassai center in discuss the cigb techniqu dr limonta comment that uniqu diagnost method have been develop for exampl we have the aubio system in which a drop of blood deposit on a plastic strip react with a seri of genet engin compon we deposit on the plastic strip structur similar to the protein of the compon of the viru membran plu a gold base dye when the drop of blood come into contact with the plastic strip a chang in color is produc which indic simpli by sight whether the person ha been infect thi system ha also been develop for us in diagnos toxoplasmosi hepat c etc and it us is now be expand to other ill it offer the advantag of not requir special equip to mix the blood and read the result and doe not even requir a technician or electr current as the result is visibl in ordinari natur light a differ method ha been develop by the cie it ha substanti improv the classic method of immunodiagnosi by reduc the amount of the blood sampl and reagent by 10 percent the efficaci of thi diagnost method ultra micro elisa hiv ha been demonstr in mani countri as well as in intern evalu by the aid refer center affili with the world health organ and paho pan american health organ for exampl in brazil canada and also in cuba itself now the cie is market an aid diagnost kit in mani countri which anyon can bui in drugstor the kit contain a paper filter a pipett to extract a blood sampl from the finger and a form the blood sampl is allow to dry on the filter the person select an anonym person code and list it on the form for exampl abc 345 and then send the dri blood sampl to a laboratori an autom reader like the cuban suma read the test and determin with a margin of accuraci of virtual 100 percent whether that person is hiv posit the person later call the laboratori give hi anonym person code and receiv the result with absolut confidenti and privaci thi system is now us in mani countri includ spain where it us ha been approv by the ministri of health and consum affair the market price is on the averag between 20 and 30 percent less than the price of other product and the cie provid technic personnel and technic analyt or instrument assist as need thi is veri conveni sai the cie director of qualiti control dr rene robaina becaus when an institut like a blood bank need assist we ar there we provid complet attent that includ everyth from the lab setup personnel train and later assist anoth advantag of thi person aid diagnosi regist internation under the name of hipertest is that the paper filter contain the blood sampl can be sent by mail or messeng as it is highli stabl onc it is dry it will last for month without the accuraci of the diagnosi be alter the hipertest is not sold in mexico but thi could be done perfectli well we simpli have to find a transfer mechan sai robaina similar for exampl to what we have in the form of joint capit ventur in russia brazil colombia spain china ghana etc the test is produc exclus in the immunoassai center the filter paper which must have an extrem homogen qualiti is import from germani the chemic reagent also come from the world market while the biolog reagent ar mostli produc in cuba the technolog is exclus cuban at the cnic medicin ar be develop against diseas that occur becaus of the weaken of immunolog defens caus by aid we ar work on medic to allevi aid we still cannot cure it sai dr carlo gutierrez but we can try to get rid of the other diseas we know there ar medic that have slightli lengthen the live of patient and we ar try to do that we ar investig the possibl of a combin of those medic and we ar now at a more advanc level than laboratori test from the laboratori we then go to bench test then to the pilot plant and final to the industri plant we ar now at the bench test stage if we can produc thi medic we could extend patient live more vaccin the finlai institut with an area of 23 000 squar meter unequal in latin america and on of the most modern in the world ha 650 employe it develop the world s first vaccin against mening and in 1990 it wa award a gold model by the unit nation world intellectu properti organ for thi achiev thi vaccin wa develop in bare five year the research had to work with live microorgan creat a high risk of infect as there is no other vaccin we took all possibl hygien precaut explain dr concepcion carma director of the institut and coordin of the research group that develop the vaccin but we had to work with larg volum of bacteria we ar talk of kilogram of live bacteria that were grown in larg 300 liter ferment vat and that wa a real risk the first volunt who us the vaccin were the research themselv becaus as a matter of ethic polici we believ that what we could not put in ourselv we could not ask anyon els to try and when we test the vaccin in children we appli the same ethic standard our own children were the first on who us the vaccin onli later did we go to field test explain the doctor thi vaccin is now be us in a number of latin american countri argentina chile colombia etc where mening is preval in brazil over 20 million dose have been administ without ani sever advers reaction be report in the cuban trial the vaccin demonstr an efficaci of 83 to 98 percent anoth import line of research is the anticholera vaccin which ha alreadi undergon laboratori test with import result when the anim test is complet the three phase of trial with human be will begin follow by field test which will have to be done in some latin american countri as cuba is the onli countri in the hemispher where cholera doe not exist against myocardi infarct at the entri to the cnic in havana the visitor can read a statement by fidel castro the futur of our nation necessarili belong to men of scienc in thi institut which is the leader and promot of cuban biotechnolog that quotat ha becom a realiti as it major achiev attest among them is ppg policosanol which combat on of the princip risk factor for infarct high cholesterol level ppg which began to be market in august 1991 wa develop from compon found in sugarcan whose solut have properti that reduc certain type of cholesterol at thi time 200 000 cuban ar us ppg regularli and the result ar posit in term of the patient physic psycholog and even sexual reaction the medic ha now been approv for us in 12 countri and it patent applic is pend in 22 more countri each pill cost 1 and the minimum recommend dosag is on tablet a dai other product whose action is similar to that of ppg the estatina mean unknown ar from 1 5 to two time more expens thei ar also try to extract from sugarcan the raw materi to produc phytosteroid in order to manufactur steroid hormon the basic element of anticontracept pill the cnic ha develop the new product beyond the laboratori stage which includ test with anim and it is now in the pilot plant level anoth of the island s natur resourc that is be us in biomedicin and biotechnolog is cuba s coral reef sinc the cuban revolut ha been care with the nation s ecolog the coral ar practic free from pollut dr gutierrez feel that the coral in human medicin ar better than synthet materi becaus synthet materi introduc molecul that mai be detriment to the human organ so at least in secondari aspect natur materi outperform artifici materi scientif studi have reveal that certain speci of coral ar materi that can be us for transplant or graft due to their great biocompat with human bone tissu both becaus of their ideal architectur a porou structur that is tridimension interconnect and becaus of their physico mechan and biochem properti calcium phosphat ozon therapi a treatment develop by the cnic that is uniqu in the world is the us of ozon therapi in treat retin pigmentosa which if left untreat lead to blind with the us of ozon therapi the advanc of the diseas ha been halt and patient sight ha been improv we have been see patient for two year sai dr gutierrez and thei have not gotten wors but improv thi ha not been done anywher els in the world origin the equip that convert oxygen into ozon wa import and cuban then develop innov applic for ozon for both therapeut and industri us at the cimeq medic and surgic research center ozon therapi is be us to dissolv compon of blood clot after five year of anim experi the treatment wa appli to human be for coronari and cerebr diseas the techniqu is still in an experiment stage but it is now be us for arteri obstruct in the lower extrem as an altern to dilat or laser treatment the result have been present at intern confer in vienna pari brazil and uruguai anoth import line of research that the cnic is pursu is the us of monoclin antibodi for diagnos plant diseas for exampl there is a product that diagnos the tristeza babesia viru which attack citru crop thi diseas doe not exist in cuba but purchas of citru fruit requir proof that the fruit doe not have thi diseas by us thi diagnost tool thi is easi to demonstr medic equip for diagnos in clinic neurophysiolog of the central nervou system computer equip ha been develop like the neuronica or medicid the neuronica is us to measur visual and auditori percept and brain wave dure sleep the medicid is veri us in analyz the nervou system and cerebr function cerebr map for exampl it provid a computer readout of electroencephalogram eeg and displai the result on a monitor due to the us embargo cuban have produc all the comput program for thi equip which is now in us in mexico the diram is anoth computer devic that provid a rapid microbiolog diagnosi in four hour it determin with reliabl the type of infect and it pattern of sensit to antibiot antibiogram a diagnosi that requir 72 hour when convent method ar us by indic the most effect antibiot for a specif infect it avoid the develop of bacteri resist the ineffect us of antibiot and fatal outcom in seriou infect becaus of the short analysi time the small volum that it requir and it low cost it is possibl to corrobor the result as often as mai be desir anoth advantag of the system is that it can be us not onli for sampl of isol and purifi strain of bacteria but also for direct specimen from blood or urin cultur in first world countri equip with similar function doe exist but it is four to five time more expens the diram is faster and cheaper and cuba is now abl to export it the cie ha develop the suma ultramocroanalyt system for the low cost analysi of laboratori sampl thi is primarili us in the diagnosi of infecti diseas in blood bank in epidemiolog and for variou health program the suma is the result of 18 year of research and the cie in havana the produc of the equip ha suma laboratori in europ asia africa and latin america the equip is us to detect aid hepat b meningococcu alphafetoprotein etc in cuba the suma is us for the prenat diagnosi of virtual all pregnant women to detect congenit malform like neural tube defect and hypothyroid dengu and cholera the pedro kouri tropic medicin institut which is respons for protect the cuban popul from epidem of infecti diseas ha kept ani infecti diseas from africa from spread in cuba despit the return home of ten of thousand of cuban soldier to do so highli effici diagnost tool have been develop there is a diagnost system for dengu fever which is now in us in mani latin american countri report dr alina llop thi rapid detect diagnost kit for antibodi is sold commerci as a kit and thi is uniqu on the intern market similar kit have been develop to detect streptococcu group b which provid result in three hour in addit analys of mening infect and cholera which with convent method take no less than four dai can be obtain in eight hour with the new cuban molecular biologi diagnost system cuba is probabl the onli countri in latin america that ha these system anoth system of great import for the third world is a new diagnost tool for amebiasi which base on molecular biologi ha a 100 percent accuraci rate thi obvious elimin the uncertainti inher in convent method there ar also other biomed and bioscientif area for exampl the develop of comput for medic imag in which cuba is on of the world leader young scientist the kei factor that explain in the wide held opinion of the director interview the spectacular advanc of the cuban biotechnolog school is the prioriti that ha been given sinc 1959 to educ and public health thank to which thei now have a critic mass of young scientist of high qualiti creativ and disciplin the human factor is actual the onli element that differenti the cuban biotechnolog school from advanc laboratori in the unit state europ and japan all high tech laboratori us the same technolog equip which explain why a visitor who enter the technolog facil of the cuban research and product center will find the same type of swiss bioreactor huge japanes electron microscop german tomograph equip and french mass spectromet that their first world counterpart have and the same thing is true for the chemic and biolog raw materi that ar not produc in cuba the polit determin of the cuban state the effici network of cooper between research and product institut the unusu combin of basic and appli research as well as the strong insist that the product must meet intern standard of qualiti ar all factor that have contribut to thi success becaus of the us embargo cuban scientif institut have necessarili had to work with european and japanes multin with us corpor remain outsid the commerci develop of thi enorm cuban potenti howev it is probabl that the us busi elit will not toler thi exclus for much longer instead it will probabl opt as it did with vietnam to cooper with cuban biotechnolog and that will be the raison d etr for put an end to the embargo cuba s continu emerg from isol throughout latin america and europ the reconcili with the miami exil and the extraordinari intern reform ar all lead in the same direct so if the cohes of the cuban model can resist for the next two or three year cuba will becom with the except of costa rica the onli latin american nation project with solid foundat enabl it to leav underdevelop behind and emerg from the backyard
