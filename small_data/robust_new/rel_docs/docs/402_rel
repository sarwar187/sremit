LA062590-0042: scienc medicin get a grip on schizophrenia psycholog each year about 100 000 american ar diagnos as schizophren despit the widespread us of the term psychiatrist ar still debat it definit and whether it is actual a diseas or ha a biolog basi at a confer titl what is schizophrenia held here earlier thi month the first speaker paus at the podium to ask for the next slide which he said would show a list of establish fact about the disord instead the screen suddenli went blank prompt wry laughter to rippl through the auditorium just what ha been establish about schizophrenia wa the subject of seriou and sometim sharp edg discuss dure thi two dai gather which took place nearli 80 year after the term wa coin by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler each year about 100 000 american ar newli diagnos as schizophren which mean that thei ar said to believ thing that aren t true to see or hear thing that aren t there to have disorgan thought and speech to exhibit variou disturb of emot and to withdraw from other most peopl we think of as crazi or dement ar like to be diagnos as schizophren but here at clark univers where freud gave a famou lectur in 1909 16 psychiatrist psychologist philosoph and social scientist gather to debat whether schizophrenia is actual a diseas and whether it ha a biolog basi challeng the convent wisdom in the field some particip propos that the disord actual doe not meet the criteria for a diseas thei also charg their colleagu with give short shrift to environment factor that lead to a diagnosi of schizophrenia the maverick in the field of mental health even question whether the word schizophrenia is meaning or us what is the it we talk about as schizophrenia psychologist morton wiener a co host of the confer ask hi colleagu we talk about outcom and we talk about effect but what s the anim itself the anim mai be a unicorn argu theodor sarbin professor emeritu of psycholog at uc santa cruz schizophrenia is a social construct to deal with peopl whose conduct is unaccept to those in posit of power he said my recommend is that we banish the term to the musti histor archiv in the 1930s i might have believ you retort psychiatrist joseph zubin an influenti research in the field in 1990 what you sai is complet nonsens part of the controversi result from the slipperi of the diagnosi in a paper present at the start of the confer manfr bleuler eugen s son observ that two peopl who ar both classifi as schizophren mai have veri differ set of symptom and mani of these featur mai be share by peopl regard as normal these ar fact he note which it would be pleasant to forget psychiatrist who defin and refin the diagnost categori of schizophrenia often have troubl agre among themselv about such thing as whether a given delus a fals belief qualifi as bizarr thi wa conced by thoma mcglashan who sit on the committe now prepar the fourth version of the diagnost and statist manual the practition s handbook later in an interview he acknowledg that the list of diagnost criteria for schizophrenia resembl a chines menu and you see that there s someth arbitrari about it still zubin and other insist that psychiatrist ar make progress in establish a systemat procedur for understand and diagnos the disord which thei refer to as a diseas it s a line of reason that will eventu lead to someth even if the word schizophrenia doesn t last forev said paul mchugh who head the depart of psychiatri at john hopkin medic school yet mchugh admit that schizophrenia is difficult to describ and defin even as a clinic concept partli becaus no on know why peopl act in wai that lead to that diagnosi most psychiatrist now believ that some neuro biolog problem is respons but sever confer particip warn about reli too heavili on such theori scientist have been too facil in invok biologi to explain schizophrenia argu robert carson a duke univers psychologist who ha written wide on the subject the reason he said ha a lot to do with what kind of research get fund the nation institut of mental health which hand out about 85 of all monei us to studi mental disord tend to pai for peopl to look at brain rather than at famili to emphas genet rather than cultur factor biolog psychiatri is veri much in the saddl particularli with respect to fund carson said the best wai to get monei from a politician is to sai give me five more year and we ll lick schizophrenia becaus it s a genet diseas but we ll never have a miracl cure becaus schizophrenia is too involv with the whole life of the person watch schizophren whose symptom come and go larg in respons to what is happen around them ha led yale psychiatrist john strauss to repudi metaphor like the broken brain strauss describ how a rave paranoid schizophren us to beat him at chess prove that he could calm down and think clearli when the situat call for it the stori is also told of a psychiatrist who had to examin a cataton schizophren in order to pass an examin the patient sat frozen ignor all question until the psychiatrist final got down on the floor with him and shout look i m go to flunk thi exam unless you sai someth whereupon the patient began to speak in short therapist need to see the patient as a goal direct be who s try to solv problem rather than as someon simpli suffer from happen in the brain sarbin said even critic of mainstream psychiatri tend to agre that genet predisposit plai some role in determin who becom schizophren but the studi of twin that led to thi conclus have been sever critic thei re so full of error as to be almost worthless said carson who along with other dissid research ha identifi numer problem with the best known studi carson also point out that even genet research conced that nearli 90 of schizophren patient have no close rel with the disord most research believ that some genet vulner individu react badli to stress which mean that both biologi and environ contribut to the appear of schizophrenia but some specialist emphas the role of the latter reject the view that schizophrenia is simpli a brain diseas that happen to peopl a view that ha found favor among organ made up of the famili of schizophren a studi publish in the new england journal of medicin last march for exampl us a new scan techniqu to compar the brain of 15 set of ident twin on of whom in each case wa schizophren differ in the brain were note in almost everi case even though ident twin have ident gene clearli someth other than genet factor must have produc those differ when research discov a neurolog abnorm in peopl with behavior disord it is usual assum that thi featur of the brain is respons for the behavior in fact though it mai work the other wai around in the schizophrenia studi it might even be that the anatom differ result from drug given to the schizophren zubin conced also cite at the confer wa a recent finnish studi that follow 271 children of schizophren mother all of whom were put up for adopt of the children who were place in famili judg as psycholog healthi not on becam schizophren contrari to the impress given in mani popular articl on the subject ucla psychologist

moreov said mcglashan director of the chestnut lodg research institut the schizophrenia as brain diseas theori is taken to mean that all you have to do is give them a drug you don t have to worri about the patient as a person univers of chicago psychiatrist laura miller who wa not at the confer agre that psychotherapi and not mere medic make sens for some schizophren even when there doe appear

evid that suggest the schizophren is an activ subject rather than the helpless object of an ill in an unpublish studi miller found that mani schizophren valu their hallucin and that as a result these peopl find some wai to continu hallucin despit their treatment while carson and other dismiss the idea that a cure will ever be found for schizophrenia larg becaus thi reflect a misconceiv notion of the natur of the disord zubin emphat reject the pessimist idea that schizophren rare get better it is not a perman chronic condit lead to deterior he said in fact from 23 to 50 of schizophren never relaps after their first episod but some of the sterner critic at the confer point out that even to talk about a first episod or about symptom is to assum the exist of an ongo diseas an assumpt not

LA100889-0040: the good health magazin psycholog the i of the storm behavior that us to be consid uneth or immor is now often blame on ill and not the individu what s the line between be wrong and be ill when do the bad gui turn into the sick gui when i heard that wade bogg the boston red sox third baseman had publicli declar himself a sex addict it set me to brood about respons now i admit i m inher lazi not enough to avoid thought altogeth but enough to keep it within certain channel bogg howev got me think about some question i had not taken an interest in sinc colleg for 20 year or so i ve been think about human behavior scientif first in anthropolog later in medicin i wa interest in the caus of behavior normal or abnorm if you could explain what caus a behavior you could if you want to try to chang it with some sort of treatment but the notion of wade bogg as a sex addict brought me up short i knew about sex addict but like most health profession includ most psychiatrist i wa dubiou about the categori i associ compuls sexual as an abnorm with women who were allow themselv to be wide and consist us i knew that there were compuls promiscu men but i just thought of them as bad gui in a world where the risk of sex is so much greater for women and where men typic have more power my natur impuls didn t lean toward medic sympathi for fellow like bogg i suppress the possibl that a medic explan exist of cours thi wa naiv in a few minut i myself could have chosen a label from the american psychiatr assn s offici diagnost manual probabl someth in the rang of impuls control disord although a more pervas person disord might produc the same symptom but in the case of bogg celebr affair with margo adam for some reason i tri to avoid label i thought back on other who have come at a certain point in life to regret the sexual excess of their youth st augustin for instanc and leo tolstoi but here someth wa miss thei were sai word like i did someth veri wrong i repent of it now you should think ill of me and you probabl should punish me with censur if noth wors but pleas ultim forgiv me i tri to understand why thi bother me it wa not mere the spectacl of a power man abus hi power and then request sympathi what troubl me wa the medic question at the heart of the spectacl how much can the concept of ill expand at the expens of the idea of respons when do the bad gui turn into sick gui although the question rang far beyond that of illeg act and into the realm of the pure moral most american have had thi issu brought to their attent in the 1980s by two celebr crimin case first john hincklei who had attempt to assassin presid reagan wa determin by some court psychiatrist to be mental ill and more import to be mental ill in a wai that meant he wa not guilti

role for technolog in answer moral question second dan white who had kill the mayor of san francisco and on of hi aid claim in hi defens that he had eaten a junk food diet high in refin sugar and that thi diet had diminish hi abil to restrain hi violent impuls the celebr twinki defens thi suggest that almost ani medic fad howev poorli support by evid could influenc the judici process both defens convinc the court and there ar similar case all the time thei come up within a framework of legal reason that emerg in the 19th centuri often refer to as the m naghten rule pronounc miknaw tn daniel m naghten in a crime foreshadow the hincklei case had attempt to kill the english prime minist in 1843 m naghten had been in the grip of paranoid delus but hi exculp produc a public outcri as well despit the fact that he wa commit perman to an asylum a committe conven by queen victoria arriv at the first formal rule for an insan plea the accus had to not know either the natur and qualiti of the act or the fact that he wa do what wa wrong later an emot base defens wa ad to the essenti knowledg base approach of m naghten although it is usual call irresist impuls the emot doe not have to be sudden for thi defens to work the main point ha to do with the loss due to mental diseas or defect of the power to choos togeth these rule made it possibl for mental ill to bring a person under the protect of two ancient legal concept ignor and coercion either of which in certain circumst could limit guilt for crime in the legal tradit that ha come down to us todai mental derang temporari or long term can be us as evid that the defend wa in the grip of an irresist impuls or that the ill so cloud hi judgement that he wa ignor of the moral mean of what he did as he did it in the common

should continu to be kept in a prison hospit for the crimin insan hi famili retain a lawyer who present a theori of why the young man had gone on a rampag assault a seri of peopl with an ax the lawyer had read some studi claim to show that too much copper wa a caus of irrat violenc now the young man wa said to have drunk enorm amount of milk as a child accord to other studi milk reduc the absorpt of copper sinc went the theori an excess of copper could caus violenc probabl a defici of copper could too thi extrem far fetch argument wa not success inde it wa difficult to see it purpos sinc the young man wa alreadi deem mental ill and wa be given treatment rather than mere be imprison yet i wa stun a complet baseless and self contradictori scientif argument wa polit heard by all concern with no form of reprimand to the lawyer who had no basi for a claim of expertis a year later return to the same prison hospit with a psychiatrist teacher i help him interview a young man who had confess to kill a woman when she reprimand him for urin on her lawn he had been work for a lawn care compani and wa appar expos to larg quantiti of organ phosphat which he wa requir to handl as fertil the psychiatrist wa prepar a case base on the notion that the organ phosphat in the fertil had given the man an uncharacterist violent impuls i pore through the doctor s stack of copi research paper organ phosphat in larg dose certainli could caus nerv damag which the young man did not have rare thei had appar caus brain damag too but almost alwai in associ with nerv damag nowher in the literatur wa there a case of brain damag caus by organ phosphat and result in violenc i couldn t help think that 30 year earlier a psychiatrist with a freudian orient would have seiz on the interperson situat a young man urin in the wrong place is surpris and reprimand by an older woman and relat the violent outburst to deep problem stem from hi childhood complet with oedipu complex and castrat anxieti now in the 80s the era of biolog psychiatri we had instead an equal tortuou and equal unsupport biochem theori the third case came closest to home i wa approach by a crimin defens lawyer and ask to testifi on behalf of hi client thi wa a man who under supposedli extrem provoc had kill hi lover in a fit of jealousi the lawyer had read a book of mine about human natur in which among mani other thing i describ situat similar to hi client s as occur in cultur throughout the world and inde as have parallel in mani anim societi he want me to testifi to these fact of anthropolog which he would then argu diminish hi client s respons for the homicid thi wa not an insan defens but intend instead to show that the man did not have men reu the crimin intent need for complet guilt i wrestl with the ethic of thi gambit would i be wrong to lend myself to it or in our advocaci system of justic would i be wrong to refus to state what i knew but then i wa let off the hook by the lawyer who had found anoth defens thi too wa instruct hi client had taken barbitur by prescript befor the crime and thei had found a psychiatrist who would testifi that thi could have impair hi capac to act in accord with the law the lawyer did not want to confus the juri by invok two sort of exoner expert testimoni and he wa more comfort with a psychiatr theori of an abnorm state of mind than with an anthropolog theori of a passion predict on ither wai and in everi on of these case the decis should be made by a judg and juri onli the common sens exercis by the juri and the common law interpret by the judg should count not the expert testimoni but in realiti judg and juri ar influenc by expert includ those who go far beyond scientif knowledg in their testimoni and in the case like bogg noncrimin question of moral judgement we as a societi and even ethic advis like minist priest rabbi and teacher ar inevit influenc by chang cultur concept of ill and respons the extrem in thi controversi were stake out by mani year ago karl menning a distinguish psychiatrist for whom among other physician famili member the famou clinic in topeka kansa is name ha been a longtim advoc of the us of medic diagnos of crimin he wrote as earli as 1928 the time will come when steal and murder will be thought of as a symptom indic the presenc of a diseas a person diseas and almost a half centuri later in respons to the notion that wick peopl exist he said i don t believ in such a thing as the crimin mind everyon s mind is crimin we re all capabl of crimin fantasi and thought by the late 1950s psychiatri wa at the peak of it power freudian psychoanalyt theori in a modifi american form appear to have won the dai and the court were show sign of accept menning s thesi clergi for their part were master the art and scienc of psychotherapi we seem as a cultur to have gone well down a path toward defin medic wicked out of exist and with it punish there would onli be ill treatment and ultim reintegr of the normal individu into societi the court and the church alik were scrambl to avoid be left behind as the new scienc led the commun in a race out of the sphere of moral judgement have jettison outmod concept like respons just at thi moment thoma szasz a psychiatrist who ha been hi own profess s most sever critic appear on the intellectu landscap hi 1961 book the myth of mental ill challeng almost everi aspect of psychiatri and publicli declar it legal author to be illegitim the book s subtitl foundat of a theori of person conduct wa signific human behavior he wrote is fundament moral behavior he argu that individu must be allow to take drug commit suicid and do harm to other without prior restraint and take the consequ of their act addict death or the full forc of the law regardless of psycholog condit the concept of mental ill he wrote elsewher is betray of common sens and of an ethic view of man summari ad to the book in 1974 state psychiatr diagnos ar stigmat label phrase to resembl medic diagnos and appli to person whose behavior annoi or offend other and the introduct of psychiatr consider into the administr of the crimin law for exampl the insan plea and verdict diagnos of mental incompet to stand trial and so forth corrupt the law and victim the subject on whose behalf thei ar ostens emploi szasz like menning ha been consist over the cours of a long career in 1972 he wrote an articl in the british medic journal the lancet call bad habit ar not diseas and in a letter to the new york time publish on june 12 1989 he wrote that even the most sever crack addict if violent ar crimin first and patient second if at all partli under hi goad and further stimul in the 80s by the hincklei case and the twinki defens a public outcri ha alter the insan plea as it stood in common law and in the model penal code of the prestigi american law institut the penal code in the 1950s help standard the common law tradit and affect law in mani state but it influenc ha weaken sinc hincklei the american bar assn and the american psychiatr assn both propos an elimin of the irresist impuls rule in 1984 the feder crimin code adopt thi suggest and also abandon the word substanti incapac in favor of complet incapac in practic term veri few case were affect most crime ar tri under state law but the messag wa influenti more than half the state includ california have follow suit on irresist impuls in addit sever state have adopt a new verdict guilti but mental ill which defens lawyer feel destroi the insan plea undermin a tradit pillar of justic thi public reaction against the insan plea wa understand highli public case had begun to make it seem as if the veri idea of right and wrong wa be abandon yet the reaction wa base in part on major misconcept which could swing the pendulum too far awai from the psychiatr concept of crimin action a highli legitim approach in certain situat but befor on pass judgement on the insan defens three thing should be consid first contrari to menning s sweep predict and despit the famou case onli a fraction of crimin defens invok the insan plea and onli a fraction of that fraction succe also studi of arrest show that few crime and even fewer violent crime under 5 ar account for by former mental patient popular fear asid few mental patient ar danger second expert ar not in charg of the decis a juri and judg ar in charg thei review the evid hear the expert testimoni on both side and make the kind of judgement that court have made for centuri befor psychiatri wa invent third a success insan defens need not get the gui off the hook and out on the street promptli as mani fear on the contrari thi outcom is rare in almost all state a verdict of not guilti by reason of insan requir at least the consider of commit and in some commit is mandatori the recent near releas of arthur jackson from prison show what can happen if a sick crimin is not medic label jackson wa convict of attempt murder in the 1982 assault of actress theresa saldana outsid her west hollywood apart though he attack her with except brutal stab her so hard and so mani time that hi hunt knife bent and then while in prison repeatedli threaten to kill her upon releas jackson wa about to be releas earli from an ordinari crimin sentenc for good behavior in june howev the california board of prison term delai hi parol for 270 dai for break prison window and resist guard effort to subdu him jackson had a long histori of mental ill befor the assault iron if he had been found guilti by reason of insan hi continu psychosi would have allow author to keep him behind bar in a prison mental hospit indefinit the idea of us the concept of ill to lengthen detent beyond what the crimin sentenc would have dictat is anathema to civil libertarian yet it wa narrowli support by the suprem court in 1983 and it mai be the most appropri respons in mani case some violent crime is the result of mental ill if detent and deterr ar two of the goal of justic then thei mai sometim be attain more effect through a medic approach in the heydai of psychiatr exoner psychiatrist claim to know more than thei knew thei claim to be abl to predict futur behavior and to be abl to cure the mental ill that caus crime as is point out by szasz and by jona robitsch who wa doubli train in psychiatri and law these claim were greatli exagger robitsch s 1980 book the power of psychiatri show some of the limit of the claim and studi over the past decad have proven him right predict is almost imposs cure is alwai partial at best and even diagnosi cannot be agre upon by expert in conflict in robitsch s word the medic basi for psychiatr author must continu to be question nevertheless such author must also continu to be consid if cure for most mental ill elud us diagnosi is in a more advanc state much better in fact than it wa even in 1980 judgement must somehow be both moral and medic if a juri identifi a crime it can with the consult of expert also identifi an ill whether the ill is treatabl result in a shorter period of incarcer than simpl imprison or untreat result in a longer detent a fair approach to wrongdoer cannot omit thi consider yet medic label must not result in the elimin of punish thi threat must enter the mind howev diseas of everi person who contempl a wrong act in a world of uncertainti onli capit punish seem unaccept it obvious differ from institution in a wai that imprison doe not in fact our frequent inabl to rule out mental ill is on of the best argument against the death penalti that penalti asid the decis as to who shall be incarcer for detent and punish and who for detent and treatment can toler a certain amount of ambigu two stori on true and on apocryph give glimps of the balanc between impuls and blame as it mai have appear at the dawn of human conscious the true on come from observ by anthropologist richard lee of the kung san of botswana a hunt and gather peopl whom i also live with and studi for two year these ar peopl without lawyer or judg without ani legal form or author and certainli without psychiatri lee show that homicid occur among them in a frequenc not veri differ from our own there is sometim reveng but there is no legal recours howev in on case of a man who kill three time the commun conclud that he wa incur violent thi in a sens wa a primit psychiatr diagnosi but the respons in thi societi without polic or prison hospit or psychiatrist wa not and could not be incarcer or medic treatment with no other choic open to them three men premedit hi homicid lai in ambush for him and kill him the second stori come from a midrash a rabbin legend about the convers between cain and god in genesi regard cain s crime of fratricid accord to the midrash the argument goe on for some time after cain ask insol am i my brother s keeper hi final challeng to god is the most intrigu on you made me as i am you put the evil inclin in me therefor i am not respons thu without mention mental ill an ancient legend rais the same philosoph problem if evil is built into some person how can we confront them with blame but the rabbi were not much impress by cain s challeng the talmud sai who is strong he who conquer hi inclin cain thei conced wa like the rest of us endow with an evil inclin but also with a good on and with a ration ethic faculti design to set and keep the balanc tip against evil as we enter the 1990s we as a societi will have to accept more and more evid that a larg part of what we call wicked is also mental ill not onli psychos and depress with delusion featur but also certain impuls control disord adjust disord sexual disord and person disord ar legitim psychiatr diagnos that might tend to caus crime or non crimin wrongdo and the frontier of diagnosi is move fast consid an instanc of sexual harass of a femal employe by her male boss while he is under the influenc of alcohol he mai blame the alcohol and thi tactic would work if he were involuntarili intox but we expect him to know that drink mai lead to such wrong and so we hold him account now suppos he is an alcohol he ha a diagnos substanc abus disord do we exoner him becaus of thi ill probabl not he should have known better than to drink himself into it but now we have on last new twist in the 80s it ha been decis shown that some individu ar genet predispos to the develop of alcohol our man turn out to be on of them in a few year time a test of hi dna mai be avail to prove it what do we sai now do we blame him for an immor act at the end of a chain of event that began with a hereditari defect i suspect that the answer is ye that we help him and blame him both but clearli the judgement is not easi in the realm of crime a substanti minor of crimin ha what in the past wa call psychopathi or sociopathi and is current call antisoci person disord such person have been extens studi by psychologist compar to averag peopl thei ar sensat seeker whose attach to other ar shallow who experi littl guilt and who ar rel unrespons to the threat of punish strictli speak such peopl have a diagnos mental ill but the court have been properli reluct to accept an insan plea from someon whose main symptom is repetit antisoci behavior along the same line the short live durham rule or product test of insan wa appli in the district of columbia for a decad begin 1954 it state that the insan plea wa valid if the crime wa the product of the person s mental ill thi rule wa drop becaus it threaten to widen the insan plea to encompass most crime the court have thu essenti reject menning s view in the crime of punish that all crime is evid of mental ill blame and punish sai on recent law text ar central to the crimin law thei ar also central to the moral fabric of societi there ar limit to punish a societi as complex and capabl as our onli humili itself when it resort to the same tactic remov by death that the otherwis helpless kung were forc to appli yet neither can we pretend that we have advanc veri far in remedi the ill that partli caus crime and if we can t cure mental ill crimin then we need to separ them from potenti victim to refus to grant them treatment while thei ar incarcer is simpli inhuman to them but to releas them in essenti the same disord state of mind in which thei commit crime befor is inhuman to their victim past and futur in the realm of the moral addict to substanc such as alcohol or habit like promiscu do plenti of damag within the bound of the law sai what we like continu pleas return to lat magazin to stone for page 44 continu about the peopl with these problem thei certainli mai have diagnos mental ill there must as in crimin case be some sens of account even if these individu have weak that ar greater than averag or impuls stronger than averag or ration ethic faculti less capabl than averag we as a societi must strengthen their self control and our own by insist that we all give an account of ourselv as moral agent no amount of explan can be allow to stand in the wai of thi account it is true as menning said that we ar all capabl of crimin fantasi and thought but onli some of us carri them out whether we ar talk about a presidenti assassin a child abus a street wise crack addict a compuls promiscu man or an alcohol celebr dry out at a famou clinic some expect of moral restraint is alwai applic the tension between these two view of unwant behavior is far from new aristotl s ethic includ the observ that foolish peopl whose folli aris from diseas e g from epilepsi or from insan ar
