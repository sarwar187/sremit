last five year as chairman he wa answer to the compani s parent royal dutch shell and never serv on the parent s board although evid compet at shell uk and well regard by hi staff he kept a fairli low profil apart from hi role in defend shell uk after an oil spill in the mersei in 1989 hi time as chairman wa mark mainli by hi effort to underlin the compani s commun work and by hi role in found the manag charter initi an industri led manag train bodi some manag at br suggest that sir bob s career as an oil man mai have been an inadequ prepar for a task as larg as complex and as polit charg as the railwai chairmanship he is also criticis for purportedli have a poor grasp of the detail of the railwai s financ and oper the latter might be less of a critic than it sound as at shell uk sir bob s polici is to entrust hi staff to get on with the dai to dai run of the railwai see hi own role more as the polici maker and strateg thinker but here too he ha disappoint hi big chanc to set out hi think wa the public last year of futur rail br vaunt prospectu set out it polici for the next 10 year when it appear the document turn out to be an insubstanti brochur of public relat materi which had almost no impact and wa forgotten the moment it appear meanwhil sir bob s public perform ha been bafflingli inconsist soon after take up the chairmanship full time he came out fight with a seri of robust public statement call for the govern to invest pound 1bn a year in the railwai to the end of the decad then he went quiet appar in the belief that if he plai fair by the govern the govern would plai fair by him that trust wa misplac as subsequ event have shown but apart from hi famou outburst after the channel tunnel link decis when you ar in the middl of a pantomim you want to stai with it he ha more or less disappear from view the run up to the privatis white paper far from trigger a feroci lobbi campaign ha seen him on an extend famili holidai in australia the temptat is to contrast sir bob s record with what might have been expect from some of those who turn the chairmanship down lord king the british airwai chairman for exampl or eurotunnel s chief execut sir alastair morton is it right howev to go as far as some tori mp do in suggest that he should be replac mr malcolm rifkind the transport secretari sai in a remark tell observ on sir bob s qualiti that the chairman is on a learn curv in term of hi relat with the media and mp in the same breath howev he sai he think highli of hi abil and look forward to work with him for the forese futur it seem unlik then that he will be press to step down quit apart from anyth els it would be near imposs to find anyon prepar to act in sir bob s place as undertak for the funer of the british railwai board when the plan privatis take place the bigger question is whether sir bob will go of hi own accord the odd ar against it to quit now would be an appal admiss of defeat for a man whose reput wa built on hi determin but if

the necessari legisl will be in place significantli too the intern train between britain and the contin due to start oper in june 1994 should have been run on exist track for more than a year so there

the panel of independ forecast my intent in do so wa to demonstr more clearli that the judgment the govern ha to make ar not base on on singl forecast i have now receiv the panel s first report and i am most grate for their contribut the panel recognis that the substanti relax of monetari polici ha greatli improv the prospect for recoveri in 1993 their forecast for growth thi year vari between 1 4 and 2 per cent with an averag of just over 1 per cent short term prospect the treasuri forecast is veri similar broadli in line with the averag of the panel s forecast we expect gdp to grow by 1 1 4 per cent thi year with the recoveri gather pace through the year growth in the year to the second half of 1993 might reach 1 3 4 per cent rise to 3 per cent in the first half of 1994 but as the panel stress uncertainti remain it is possibl that growth thi year mai exce the 1 1 4 per cent forecast that i have made but there ar signific downsid risk too it is veri difficult to be sure when consum will feel that their financ ar sound enough to support a stronger growth of spend and there ar as i have said consider doubt about the prospect for our major export market thi will inevit affect the prospect for the current account the deficit in 1992 wa about pound 12bn and as the economi recov and the unfavour short term effect of the fall in the exchang rate feed through i expect the deficit to widen thi year to pound 17 5bn but the measur i shall be put in place todai should help to strengthen our trade posit over the year ahead and i expect the deficit in the meantim to be readili financ the medium term mr deputi speaker the kei to an improv trade perform li in the competit of our product and the sign ar encourag earn ar now grow more slowli than at ani time for 25 year labour product ha been rise rapidli and while unit wage cost in manufactur have been rise in japan and germani here thei show no increas at all dure 1992 british busi now ha a great opportun to expand into oversea market and to replac import at home but cost must be kept under firm control the govern s task is to provid a clear and practic framework for polici to ensur that busi ha the freedom and the support it need to get on with the job our strategi for sustain growth rest on three kei principl first that growth come from the privat sector not from whitehal second that a continu commit to low inflat is vital if competit is to be maintain and third that the onli wai to increas the countri s long term growth rate is by improv the suppli perform of the economi suppli side polici mr deputi speaker suppli side improv ar seldom the stuff of headlin but the polici thi govern ha pursu have begun to improv the wai that market work we have transfer to privat ownership some two third of the state sector we inherit and our labour market reform have given back to manag the power to manag so that last year the number of dai lost to strike wa the lowest for a centuri but we still have a long agenda of unfinish busi in my autumn statement i set out propos to increas the role of the privat sector in modernis britain s infrastructur and i also announc addit resourc to underpin the educ reform we have set in train the wealth of a nation depend larg upon the skill of it peopl and noth could be more import for the long term perform of the british economi than the steadi improv in educ and skill that thi govern is commit to bring about inflat and monetari polici but if long term improv in econom perform ar determin larg by the suppli side we have seen all too often in the past 20 year how short term prospect can be blown off cours by inflat i am absolut determin that thi should not happen again the govern s object is to keep the underli rate of retail price inflat within the rang of 1 4 per cent and to bring it down to the lower half of that rang by the end of thi parliament i expect underli inflat to be 3 3 4 per cent at the end of thi year close to the top of it target rang but inflat should fall further over the medium term monetari polici is set to meet that object the detail framework for monetari polici wa set out in my letter to the treasuri and civil servic select committe last autumn and sinc then i have introduc two further develop to demonstr our determin to conduct monetari polici in a wai that will deliv our inflat target we now publish a monthli monetari report which show the inform that guid our decis and i have also ask the bank of england to provid regular report on our progress toward meet our inflat object interest rate decis ar base on a continu assess of monetari condit measur princip by the growth of narrow and broad monei and movement in the exchang rate and asset price and alongsid the target for inflat i am set monitor rang for both the narrow and broad measur of the monei suppli for the period of thi parliament the rang ar 0 4 per cent for m0 and 3 9 per cent for m4 in judg the prospect for inflat i have to weigh the evid from all the indic taken togeth if ani on is out of line it is particularli import to assess it signific against the perform of the other follow the recent substanti reduct in interest rate m0 growth mai be abov it monitor rang in the period ahead but on the basi of the indic taken togeth i believ that interest rate at their current level ar consist with the achiev of the govern s inflat object and at the lowest level in the european commun thei ar also fulli consist with the prospect for recoveri thi year i turn now to fund a subject of peculiar fascin for mani citi comment and of particular interest to a number of my rt hon and hon friend the govern s full fund polici ensur that it borrow doe not add to inflationari pressur i am clear that thi polici remain appropri but from time to time it ha been right to reconsid it detail applic i have therefor decid that transact by bank and build societi in gilt will from now on be includ in the fund definit in period when bank and build societi reduc their hold of gilt extra sale to other sector will be need but in current condit the chang i am make will help to eas the pressur on liquid and avoid complic monei market arrang if it also lead to some strengthen in the growth of m4 that would be no bad thing in the year ahead sale of gilt will as usual form the bedrock of the fund programm but nation save will again make an import contribut fiscal polici mr deputi speaker in control inflat monetari polici must of cours be support by a sustain fiscal polici i expect a psbr in the current financi year of pound 35bn slightli lower than project at the time of my autumn statement but becaus unemploy tend to increas for a while even after growth ha resum and becaus some tax particularli corpor tax ar collect a year in arrear i expect borrow next year to rise further the psbr for 1993 94 ha therefor been set at pound 50bn some 8 per cent of gdp unless action is taken larg deficit will continu over the medium term the psbr could still be around 6 per cent of gdp in 1996 97 the last year of thi parliament i do not believ that borrow on that scale is accept and i shall be announc measur todai to reduc it progress over the year ahead in the earli 1980s we took step to bring the public financ back under control we turn a psbr of over 5 per cent of gdp into a surplu of 3 per cent and we nearli halv the ratio of public sector debt to gdp we did not shrink from make the necessari chang then and i will not shrink from make them todai the rise in the psbr sinc 1989 90 is larg due to the recess and becaus of the reduct in the nation debt in the 1980s i have been abl to allow the so call automat stabilis the increas in public spend and the reduct in tax receipt that directli reflect the weak of the economi to oper fulli it wa right to do thi to maintain the level of demand dure the recess but just as a busi cannot go on year after year ignor a fall in cashflow caus by a downturn in the economi so too the govern cannot keep on run up debt in the hope that recoveri will solv our problem even if the higher debt we now face wa larg caus by the recess the extra borrow still ha to be financ and as debt mount up so too do the debt interest payment in thi wai what might have start off as a cyclic deficit will soon becom a structur deficit unless action is taken to bring borrow down all round the world we see countri strive to reduc their fiscal deficit or suffer from their failur to do so sooner presid clinton s programm show that the need for fiscal disciplin is now wide understood and the deficit which the italian ar now have to deal with is a salutari warn to those who think that a problem postpon is a problem solv those who argu that there is no need for action should confront the consequ of such a cours the consequ not just for the public financ but also for the level of interest rate for all these reason i believ that the greatest threat to sustain recoveri in britain would come not from a lack of demand but from excess govern borrow over the medium term we have to address that problem now action to bring the fiscal deficit down clearli ha to start with the amount the govern spend the new control arrang i put in place last year were an import first step and we now have firm ceil for expenditur over the next three year that will keep the growth of spend below that of the economi as a whole but proper control of public expenditur cannot be achiev simpli by set target it requir a continu examin of each and everi depart and of all the function of govern what wa onc a desir role for the public sector mai no longer be appropri todai and that is why the fundament review of public spend programm ar so import these review will inevit take time so i have also had to look to the revenu side of the account in do so i have had to balanc two kei object first the essenti task of help recoveri second the need to tackl the deficit so that the recoveri will be sustain i believ mr deputi speaker that my propos strike that balanc in the year ahead 1993 94 their effect will be broadli neutral thu allow the recoveri to take hold and i will be announc later some measur to improv that prospect by help busi and the unemploi but for subsequ year as the economi strengthen my propos ar design to build in a wedg of steadili rise revenu overal thei will rais revenu by pound 6 5bn in 1994 95 and by pound 10 5bn in 1995 96 equival to 1 1 2 per cent of gdp in set out the govern s plan for rais revenu good intent ar not enough i intend that as far as possibl these propos should be legisl for in thi year s financ bill taken togeth with the tight public expenditur plan i announc in the autumn statement thei should ensur that the psbr return toward balanc over the medium term but if further action prove necessari i shall not hesit to take it taxat object mr deputi speaker the propos i shall be announc todai ar part of a continu programm of tax reform a programm which ha sharpen work incent and improv the effici of the economi in decid where to look for addit revenu i have been guid by a number of principl first that where possibl monei should be rais in a wai that will not damag the work of the economi second that in gener thi mean reduc the valu of allow and broaden the tax base rather than increas margin tax rate and third that taxat should support social health and environment object i will deal with my revenu rais propos in two part i will start with my propos for the year ahead 1993 94 and then describ the measur i propos for the two year thereaft for the year immedi ahead as i have said my propos ar broadli neutral my object ha been to strengthen the recoveri by give help to busi but in order to pai for thi i have had to rais revenu from other sector of the economi allow first incom tax with inflat now down to level not seen for a gener i propos for the year ahead to freez the person allow the marri coupl s and relat allow the basic rate limit and the incom limit for ag relat allow unlead petrol increas by 12p per gallon vat to be introduc on domest fuel and power warn head depth do not match the threshold for inherit tax the capit gain tax exempt amount and the earn limit for tax relief on pension contribut will also remain unchang thi will save some pound 670m thi year excis duti second excis duti the remov of custom control at the channel ha been welcom by mani thousand of travel who ar now see the benefit of the singl market at first hand and it ha also brought mani benefit to british busi includ some 10m fewer form thi year but there is natur concern too about the impact an increas in cross border shop might have on british busi particularli in the south east in consid what chang to make to excis duti i have had to balanc thi against the need to rais revenu i have therefor decid to rais the duti on most alcohol drink by onli 5 per cent thi year from 6 00 pm todai the total tax on a pint of beer will rise by about on and a half penc and that on a bottl of wine by about five and a half penc i have also receiv mani represent thi year about the taxat of spirit and in particular the taxat on whiski thi is on of britain s most success export industri i promis in my budget speech last year to resist propos from brussel to introduc tax rule which would hit whiski sale in european market but have succeed there it is import that our own tax regim doe not further disadvantag thi industri i have therefor decid to make no chang in the duti on spirit thi year i am sure thi will be welcom on all side of the hous and especi in scotland next tobacco last juli my rt hon friend the secretari of state for health publish a white paper contain our commit to maintain the real valu of the taxat on tobacco product but again i have also had to take into account the impact of the singl market i propos therefor to increas the overal burden of duti by some 6 1 2 per cent 4 per cent abov the rate of inflat thi will add 10 penc to a typic pack of 20 cigarett and i regret to sai some 4 1 2 penc to a pack of 5 small cigar but i also propos to make thi increas in a differ wai from usual as the hous will recal cigarett ar subject to two differ excis duti a specif duti which is a flat rate charg per cigarett and an ad valorem duti on their price given that the health object is to tax the harm cigarett do it is better to tax the cigarett themselv rather than their price i therefor propos to increas the specif duti on cigarett by 10 per cent while cut the ad valorem duti from 21 per cent to 20 per cent thi will mean a proportion bigger tax increas for cheap cigarett mani of which ar import i also propos thi year to increas the duti on most game machin by 20 per cent taken togeth these chang will rais pound 290m in 1993 94 and pound 365m in 1994 95 mr deputi speaker i turn now to motor tax where i propos to combin rais revenu with tax reform when i abolish car tax in my autumn statement i said that i would recoup the cost from other motor tax i therefor propos to rais all fuel duti by 10 per cent from 6 00 pm todai put 12 penc on a gallon of unlead petrol and 15 penc on a gallon of four star from midnight tonight vehicl excis duti for car the tax disc will also rise by pound 15 to pound 125 taken togeth with the abolit of car tax these measur will rais a net pound 400m in 1993 94 the overal impact will be to shift the tax burden from car buyer to car user and to help both the environ and the industri togeth with the increas i have announc on alcohol and tobacco duti it will add 1 4 percentag point to the rpi in april compar with index fuel scale alongsid the increas in fuel duti i propos to increas by 20 per cent the scale charg for free fuel suppli to compani car driver for privat us i also propos to abolish the 50 per cent discount current avail to driver do more than 18 000 busi mile in a year employe can of cours avoid thi tax altogeth by pai for the full cost of all fuel provid for privat journei themselv the environment impact of my propos on fuel duti will be strengthen by reduc the number of motorist who us fuel at no direct cost to themselv thi measur will rais pound 65m in the year ahead and pound 70m in 1994 95 compani car and van i turn next to the tax treatment of compani car from it introduct in 1976 until 1988 the incom tax charg on compani car significantli underestim their true valu sinc then charg have been steadili rais to more appropri level i propos thi year to complet that process by bring the car scale up to a level which fulli reflect the true valu of the benefit of a compani car thi requir an increas in the car scale of 8 per cent bring addit revenu of pound 100m in 1993 94 but as i said last year the structur of the current regim remain unsatisfactori in most case the valu put on the benefit and the tax that is payabl ar determin not by the price of the car but by the size of it engin thi might have matter less when scale charg were veri low but it now give rise to seriou distort follow consult with the industri i propos from 1994 95 to replac the current car scale with a simpl system base on the price of the car the annual benefit of a compani car will be valu for incom tax purpos at a fix percentag of the manufactur s list price to make the reform revenu neutral i propos to set that percentag at 35 per cent compani car user will then pai incom tax at their margin rate on that amount howev i do not believ that it would be right to appli the full rigour of the charg to those who us the compani car larg for busi purpos i therefor propos that there should be a discount of on third for those compani car user who drive more than 2 500 mile a year on busi and a discount of two third for those who do more than 18 000 busi mile in futur the tax on compani car will rise or fall automat with the price of those car it follow that there will no longer be ani need to set the tax charg each year in the budget my reform will reduc tax distort in the car market and enabl manufactur and fleet manag to plan product and purchas in a more ration and stabl system for these reason i believ it will be welcom i also propos to replac the exist complex arrang for tax employe privat us of compani van with a simpl scale charg cover both the van and ani fuel provid set at the modest level of pound 500 thi will rais pound 10m in the year ahead and pound 35m in 1994 95 anti avoid in addit i intend to close a number of loophol which have been exploit to avoid tax first from midnight last night i propos to exclud from the busi expans scheme all scheme which involv the provis of loan to be investor the be wa set up to encourag invest in small busi not to provid highli subsidis loan for top rate taxpay second i intend to end the practic wherebi group compani bui up other compani with capit loss simpli in order to set those loss against their own capit gain third i intend to restrict the situat in which chang in compani ownership can creat scope to avoid advanc corpor tax final i propos to tighten the rule for foreign compani under uk control full detail of these and other measur ar provid in a seri of inland revenu press notic be issu todai taken togeth thei should rais some pound 70m in 1993 94 rise to over pound 480m in the follow year tauru befor leav my propos for 1993 94 i wish to make clear the posit on stamp duti on secur and properti other than land and build follow the decis by the stock exchang last week to abandon tauru stamp duti will remain in place at least for 1993 94 rais pound 1bn dure the come year i will review the posit further in the light of the conclus of the secur settlement task forc set up by the bank of england the measur i have propos so far will rais pound 2 4bn in 1993 94 not includ stamp duti of thi pound 750m is requir to financ the abolit of car tax i will be us a larg part of the rest to reduc tax on busi revenu measur 1994 95 and beyond but befor i turn to busi tax i intend to set out my tax propos for 1994 95 and the year thereaft as i have alreadi explain these tax propos will build up over the year creat a wedg of increas revenu which as far as possibl will be legisl for in the come financi year nation insur contribut in my autumn statement i took some tough decis on current spend to maintain capit programm but to protect the poorest and most vulner member of societi we also decid to uprat social secur benefit in full that decis wa warmli welcom on all side of the hous but had no further action been taken the effect of that decis combin with the rise in unemploy would have been to push the nation insur fund into deficit to prevent thi i introduc a new treasuri grant and legisl to implement thi ha been now taken through the hous thi make sens at a time when ensur econom recoveri is our prioriti but it is clearli not a fair or reason basi for financ the nation insur fund over the medium term a treasuri grant is paid for by the gener bodi of taxpay includ million of pension who have alreadi made a full contribut to the fund throughout their work live accordingli my rt hon friend the secretari of state for social secur and i propos to place the financ of the nation insur fund on a firmer foot i do not propos to increas nation insur contribut in the come year howev from april 1994 my rt hon friend and i propos to increas the class 1 main rate of employe nation insur contribut by 1 per cent to 10 per cent and the class 4 rate for the self emploi by 1 per cent to 7 3 per cent the arrang for employe earn below the lower earn limit and the self emploi with profit below the lower profit limit will be unchang by these measur the necessari legisl will be brought befor the hous in the come year taken togeth these increas will rais about pound 1 8bn in 1994 95 and pound 2 2bn in a full year but mr deputi speaker that will still leav a deficit in the nation insur fund of pound 2 8bn in 1994 95 and a similar sum the follow year nation insur contribut ar of cours paid not just by employe and the self emploi but also by employ and when a deficit of thi size emerg in the fund it is natur to look to all contributor to make up the balanc the remain deficit is roughli equival to an increas in the employ nation insur contribut rate of 1 2 per cent from 10 4 per cent to 11 6 per cent but have reflect carefulli i do not believ that it would be appropri to increas the burden on employ i therefor propos to retain a smaller treasuri grant to make up the continu shortfal in the fund north sea fiscal regim mr deputi speaker on of the main object of thi govern s tax reform ha been to elimin tax rule which distort invest decis thi wa the drive forc for exampl behind the far reach reform of the corpor tax system in 1984 todai i wish to carri thi principl through into anoth import sector of the economi the north sea and in particular petroleum revenu tax or prt when prt wa introduc in 1975 the north sea oil sector look veri differ oil price were veri high and the typic oil field wa rel larg the purpos of the new tax wa to ensur that the exchequ got it fair share of the larg profit that were there to be made in the north sea while compani were left with a reason return on their invest but as the north sea ha develop the prt regim ha come to look increasingli anachronist as profit in mani exist field attract a margin tax rate of over 83 per cent there is littl incent for compani to keep cost under control or for addit invest in exist field moreov as a result of the uniqu gener allow that ar avail the exchequ is no longer get a fair return in 1991 92 the prt regim actual cost the exchequ pound 200m as mani in the oil industri recognis thi is neither reason nor sustain the north sea tax regim ha to be place on a clear long term foot so todai i intend to set out a major reform which will rais revenu in the medium term and give the oil industri a stabl framework to plan ahead i propos from 1 juli thi year to reduc the prt rate on exist field from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and for new field i propos with effect from todai to abolish prt entir it follow that for new field i also intend to scrap all the allow that go with the exist prt system includ for exampl relief for explor and apprais expenditur that can be set against prt on exist field but contract enter into befor todai for explor and apprais will continu to get relief against prt on exist field for the next two year allow that can be claim within exist field will remain essenti unchang thi reform will greatli simplifi the tax regim for new field disappli at a stroke some 300 page of complex legisl and it mean that the onli tax on new oil field in the north sea will be corpor tax at 33 per cent the lowest rate of busi tax in the industrialis world britain will have a competit tax regim which strike a reason balanc between the interest of the industri and those of the nation as a whole for mr deputi speaker the paradox of thi reform is that despit the abolit of prt for new field and the reduc rate for exist field after 1993 94 it will actual rais revenu for the exchequ i expect the yield in 1994 95 to be some pound 300m and in the follow year some pound 400m reloc expens i turn now to anoth area where reform is long overdu the tax treatment of job relat reloc expens when a compani ask it employe to move hous it mai offer help with reloc expens usual that involv pai for the cost of the remov but sometim if the move is to a more expens area the employ will also pai allow toward the employe s higher live cost for the past 40 year we have allow employe to receiv most of thi help tax free provid the employe ha sold hi exist home a condit which ha attract some critic thi mean that someon whose employ give them as much as pound 25 000 might pai no tax on it at all on the other hand peopl who decid to move to find work and pai their own cost get no help from the tax system whatsoev i see a case for some measur of relief where employ help meet employe remov expens howev it is difficult to find a convinc rational for a system of tax relief whose effect is to give the biggest subsidi to those move to the highest cost area and with these relief expect to cost the exchequ no less than pound 800m thi year i believ the time ha come for reform i am therefor ask the inland revenu to withdraw the present extra statutori concess which help peopl move to a more expens area and i propos to restrict relief on remov expens to payment of up to pound 8 000 for peopl whose employ requir them to reloc after 6 april thi year under the new system the exist home need no longer be sold to qualifi for relief although these chang come into effect immedi thei will not start to rais revenu until the year after about pound 200m in both 1994 95 and 1995 96 mr deputi speaker i turn now to mortgag interest relief the rapid expans of home ownership is on of thi govern s most endur achiev and i have no plan to chang the exist ceil for mortgag interest relief of pound 30 000 but in the last few budget we have taken step to improv the focu of mortgag interest relief and to contain it cost most recent in my 1991 budget by restrict the relief to the basic rate even so mortgag interest relief is expect to cost the exchequ pound 4 3bn next year alon i propos therefor to reduc the rate at which relief is given from 25 to 20 per cent but i propos to defer the implement of thi chang until april 1994 in all thi chang will yield pound 900m in 1994 95 and pound 960m in the follow year at current mortgag rate no borrow will be more than pound 10 a month wors off from the reduc rate of relief and for mani with mortgag below pound 30 000 the increas in payment will be even smaller moreov it is the level of interest rate not the amount of tax relief that is the most import determin of the cost of a mortgag becaus interest rate have fallen so far sinc octob 1990 payment on the averag mortgag have been cut by over pound 150 a month so the cost of the chang i am propos is equal to just a fraction of the benefit mortgag payer have alreadi receiv from lower mortgag rate i know that there ar some elderli peopl with life annuiti home incom plan which allow them to draw down some of the save thei have invest in their hous such scheme will continu to attract relief at 25 per cent mr deputi speaker i am fulli awar that despit some encourag sign of increas activ the hous market remain fragil that is why the chang i have describ will not come into effect until next year and that is also why i have on further propos which will affect peopl bui hous wherea my propos on mortgag interest relief do not appli until april 1994 thi measur come into effect immedi i propos to doubl the stamp duti threshold to pound 60 000 for document execut from todai and not stamp befor 23 march when the requir budget resolut ha been consid by thi hous thi mean that the cost of bui home price at between pound 30 000 and pound 60 000 will be reduc by up to pound 600 from todai the number of transact in the hous market liabl to stamp duti will be halv thi will be of particular benefit to first time buyer who tend to bui less expens home with mortgag interest rate at their lowest level for decad thi reduct in stamp duti should provid a further stimulu to the hous market the chang will cost pound 220m in 1993 94 and about pound 270m in the follow year marri coupl s allow mr deputi speaker last year i announc a signific chang in the treatment of the marri coupl s allow give coupl greater flexibl in alloc it between them todai i have a further import chang to propos at present the marri coupl s allow reduc a taxpay s liabil at hi or her margin rate a taxpay on the 20 per cent lower rate benefit by pound 344 but a higher rate taxpay get pound 688 twice as much there is no good reason why an allow intend to recognis the respons of marriag should give least to those on low incom and most to those right at the top of the incom scale from 6 april 1994 i therefor propos to restrict relief for the marri coupl s allow to the lower rate of 20 per cent it will then be worth the same amount to taxpay at all level of incom the allow which ar link to the marri coupl s allow for those ag under 65 will be similarli restrict becaus of the higher level of allow to which thei ar entitl thi chang will bear harder on elderli marri coupl so also from 1994 95 i propos to increas by pound 200 the marri coupl s allow for those ag 65 and over thi will ensur that pension pai tax at the basic rate ar affect in the same wai as ani other basic rate taxpay by the chang and elderli marri coupl in the lower rate band will actual gain slightli as i have said these chang will not come into effect until 1994 95 thei will then rais about pound 900m in 1994 95 and pound 1 2bn in 1995 96 green measur mr deputi speaker in recent year there ha been much debat on the subject of global warm and the role tax measur can plai in combat it thi ha led the european commiss to propos a commun wide carbon tax there mai inde be a case for further co ordin intern action on global warm but i remain unpersuad of the need for a new european commun tax tax polici should continu to be decid here in thi hous not in brussel individu countri should of cours take their own measur to give peopl the right signal to encourag the effici us of energi todai i shall propos measur design to do just that and to rais revenu at the same time last june my rt hon friend the prime minist sign the un convent on climat chang at rio thi wa a mileston in intern effort to halt global warm when britain and other countri have ratifi the convent the govern will be commit to bring forward measur aim at return greenhous ga emiss from thi countri to 1990 level by the year 2000 my rt hon friend the secretari of state for the environ publish last decemb a consult paper which set out the variou option the largest contribut to the growth in uk carbon dioxid emiss in the come year is expect to come from the transport sector i therefor propos to make clear todai the govern s long term intent on road fuel duti we intend to rais road fuel duti on averag by at least 3 per cent a year in real term in futur budget in addit to the increas i have alreadi announc for thi year in decid the level of duti to be levi in ani particular budget we will of cours take full account of condit at the time includ if charg for motorwai and urban road ar introduc the overal level of tax and charg which road user ar pai but my announc todai will help manufactur and consum to plan ahead it should provid a strong incent for motorist to bui more fuel effici vehicl and it will rais at least a further pound 520m in 1994 95 and pound 950m in 1995 96 but mr deputi speaker in order to meet the commit we enter into at rio action will be requir not just in the transport sector but across the whole economi and in decid how best to meet our carbon emiss target we will need to ensur that the right incent ar in place throughout the economi encourag peopl to consum less and conserv more abov all it is crucial to avoid take measur that will have a disproportion impact on the competit of british industri against thi background mr deputi speaker i have on further measur to propos that will not onli encourag greater energi effici in everi household in the countri but will also rais a consider amount of revenu for the exchequ over the year ahead fuel and energi suppli to industri pai vat in britain those to the home do not in thi respect we ar uniqu in the european commun i therefor propos over the next two year to end the zero rate of vat on domest fuel and power again thi chang will not come into effect immedi but in 1994 vat will be charg at 8 per cent from 1 april 1994 and at 17 1 2 per cent from 1 april 1995 mr deputi speaker thi measur will rais some pound 950m in1994 95 pound 2 3bn in 1995 96 and around pound 3bn a year thereaft for the first time the rate of vat on domest fuel and power will be the same as that charg on good like loft insul materi which improv energi effici thi will bring an end to the current anomali which make a nonsens of ani attempt to us the tax system to improv the environ my intent is to legisl for thi propos thi year mr deputi speaker social secur benefit will of cours rise automat to reflect the price effect of thi chang but i recognis that thi will caus particular problem for those on low incom my rt hon friend the secretari of state for social secur will take thi into account when the incom relat benefit ar uprat next year togeth with measur which have alreadi been announc these tax propos should take britain two third of the wai to meet the rio target and thei will do so in a wai that doe the least possibl damag to the competit of british industri i am confid that the remain gap can be fill through sensibl energi save measur as and when the convent is ratifi by our major industri competitor mr deputi speaker the measur i have announc so far will rais substanti revenu in 1994 95 and beyond i turn now to my measur for busi deregul as the hous is awar the govern ha embark on a major drive to reduc the burden of regul on industri i will therefor start with three signific measur of deregul which should be of particular benefit to the self emploi and to small busi gener self assess of incom tax ha oper successfulli in mani countri includ the unit state but none of my predecessor ha found a wai of introduc it here for most peopl that ha not been a problem the pay system alreadi deal veri simpli with the tax affair of some 16 million employe but for the 8m taxpay who have to fill in a tax return each year the current arrang ar veri far from simpl follow a detail consult exercis i now propos to offer these peopl includ 4m self emploi the option of self assess legisl will be brought forward in next year s financ bill to implement the propos from the earliest practic date which is 1996 97 for those who choos to take it up self assess should provid a signific reduct in bureaucraci and paperwork and it will also bring out more clearli the link between public expenditur and the burden thi place on the individu taxpay a more transpar tax system can onli lead to more inform choic and debat and i believ that self assess for a third of all taxpay will contribut to that but for self assess to work the tax system ha to be simpl enough for taxpay themselv to be abl to fill in their own tax return my second reform will achiev a signific simplif particularli for the self emploi on of the least attract featur of our present tax system is that it is simpli too complic for them to work out how much tax thei ow peopl set up in busi on their own ar more or less forc to emploi an account sinc 1926 the self emploi work under the so call preced year basi of assess have gener paid a tax bill base on profit thei made up to two year previous peopl with sever differ sourc of incom mai be assess on a number of differ base with separ tax bill and payment date for each it would be difficult to invent a more complic system for tax the self emploi even if on set out with that veri object under my new propos peopl will have just on tax bill each year cover all their incom and the self emploi will pai tax on the profit thei make in the current year not the preced year thi should be a major simplif and i am sure it will be warmli welcom taken togeth these two measur amount to the most fundament reform of incom tax administr sinc the introduct of pai as you earn in 1944 my third announc will be of particular interest to smaller busi at present all incorpor busi must have their account audit while it is clearli import that account should be reliabl and inde that the inland revenu and other user should have the assur thei need that the account have been drawn up properli the current statutori audit requir impos a disproportion cost on smaller busi my rt hon friend the presid of the board of trade will therefor shortli be issu a consult document set out option for reduc thi burden at least for the veri smallest incorpor busi thi would deliv signific save and would repres a major step in cut out red tape busi tax mr deputi speaker reduc the govern s borrow requir will benefit busi by ensur that the recoveri is sustain but as i said in my mansion hous speech last octob the govern is determin to keep all our polici under continu review to ensur that british busi ha the back it need to compet in world market and thi is particularli true of our tax polici britain alreadi ha the lowest rate of tax on busi profit in the industrialis world and we have a person tax system which make it attract for entrepreneur and manag to live and work in britain we intend to see that continu britain ha had an outstand record over recent year in attract invest from oversea inde we have attract no less than a third of all foreign invest into the ec over the last few year but we cannot be complac with the advent of the singl market the competit in europ to secur inward invest ha becom ever more intens so my budget set out to ensur that our busi tax regim retain it clear competit edg surplu act and the taxat of dividend in talk to busi organis over the last few month on issu ha come up again and again the problem of surplu advanc corpor tax or act mani believ that thi featur of our tax system both penalis success british own intern compani and distort invest decis thi issu ha of cours been with us for mani year and it ha so far defi solut nonetheless i made a commit in my budget last year to return to it and i am pleas to be abl to report to the hous that i have now found a wai forward i hope that the hous will bear with me as i am afraid that my propos ar complex but thei do attack the problem of surplu act thei ar central to the strategi of thi budget and thei rais a signific amount of revenu at present act is paid on dividend at 25 per cent thi fund a tax credit which cover the basic rate incom tax bill of the sharehold but as it name impli it is also an advanc payment of the compani s corpor tax bill in normal circumst the system work veri well but sometim it doe bring problem particularli for compani which earn a larg proport of their profit oversea these compani often end up pai an act bill on their dividend that is greater than their entir uk corpor tax liabil the so call surplu act that result cannot be claim back in effect it becom an extra tax on profit and thi can have damag econom effect for exampl it give some compani a strong incent to move import activ includ research and develop abroad lead to the loss of skill and job in the uk it cannot be right to distort the commerci decis of british compani in thi wai or to give them an incent to move elsewher in europ so todai i am put forward some propos that will go a long wai toward allevi the problem first i shall establish a special tax regim from 1994 95 to help foreign own intern compani which ar consid set up their headquart in the uk thi will make it more attract for intern compani to base their oper in britain and it will further promot london s posit as europ s lead financi centr second i am todai issu a consult document propos a scheme under which british compani mai choos to class ani dividend paid out of oversea profit as a foreign incom dividend unlik normal uk dividend thi will not carri ani tax credit and although act would initi be payabl in the usual wai the compani will be entitl to a refund if it give rise to surplu act onc fulli oper thi scheme could reduc the build up of surplu act by some pound 250m a year final mr deputi speaker i have on further propos which will help not just compani with surplu act but all dividend pai compani and it will do so in a wai that will also rais consider revenu i propos simpli to reduc the rate of act in two stage from 25 per cent to 22 1 2 per cent in 1993 94 and then to 20 per cent in 1994 95 reduct of 7 1 2 in ecgd premium loan guarante scheme premium to small busi fall warn head depth do not match thi will give compani which pai dividend a cash flow benefit of about pound 2bn over the next two year and it will reduc the build up of surplu act by about pound 300m a year i also propos to reduc from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in 1993 94 the tax credit that sharehold get when thei receiv a dividend those familiar with these issu a select few i fear will know that tax credit affect two main group of sharehold those with no tax liabil particularli pension fund can claim a cash payment from the inland revenu for the tax credit and higher rate taxpay have to make up the differ between the 40 per cent top rate of tax and the 25 per cent tax credit thei receiv so the reduct in the tax credit i am propos will have two import effect first the payment that lower rate payer non taxpay and particularli pension fund get from the inland revenu will be reduc by 5 percentag point save the exchequ no less than pound 1bn a year second higher rate taxpay will have to pai an extra 5 per cent of tax on the dividend thei receiv in order to discharg their liabil to tax at the top rate of 40 per cent thi in turn will yield an extra pound 200m a year final in order to ensur that most ordinari sharehold ar not affect by thi chang i also propos to reduc the rate of tax on dividend from the current basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent the effect of thi combin with the chang to tax credit is to leav most basic rate taxpay neither better off nor wors off than thei ar now so mr deputi speaker these propos achiev three object at the same time thei will give compani a pound 2bn cashflow boost over the next two year thei will significantli reduc the problem of surplu act for the futur and thei will rais pound 900m in extra revenu for the exchequ from 1995 96 onward there is howev on group for whom i believ it would be desir to eas the immedi effect of these chang i therefor propos for chariti to phase in the effect of the reduct in the tax credit over a four year period i also have some further measur for chariti to which i shall turn later export credit the hous will be reliev to hear that my next measur is a littl less opaqu but it is equal import for the long term success of british manufactur in the autumn statement i announc a substanti increas in export credit to help british busi win major contract abroad but the fact remain that export credit insur ha prove expens for the taxpay for that reason the govern ha negoti hard over the year to secur a reduct in the subsidi offer by other countri some progress ha been made and we shall continu in that effort but in the meantim british firm ar sometim at a competit disadvantag in seek busi oversea my rt hon friend the presid of the board of trade and i have therefor look again at the whole rang of ecgd servic and have decid to make some import chang first premium last year premium were cut on averag by about 20 per cent but there is scope to do more we have therefor decid to make a further reduct of 7 1 2 per cent in the averag level of ecgd premium thi mean that while premium for individu export market will alwai differ the averag level of premium paid by british export next year will be down to around the averag paid by their g7 competitor second export credit cover in the autumn statement i increas the cover avail to export by pound 200m thi year and by a further pound 500 million for 1993 94 over the next three year my rt hon friend and i propos that addit cover of pound 1 3bn should be made avail for those export into some of the fastest grow and most import market around the world taken togeth with my autumn statement announc thi mean that the annual cover for these market will have increas by more than 75 per cent in just 4 year as a result british firm will now be abl to go out into export market with greater confid that thei can compet on a more equal basi with their oversea competitor i am sure that thei will seiz the opportun that ar now avail to them insur over the year on of britain s most success export industri ha been insur but for some year now the industri ha argu that the tax relief avail to some of their european counterpart put them at a competit disadvantag in fact that is not the whole stori in other respect our own tax system is veri favour nevertheless have review the posit again i believ that there mai inde be a case for allow tax relief on certain type of equalis reserv cover occasion except loss but if such reserv ar to be allow for tax thei would also have to be within the regulatori framework for the industri thi would be a major departur for both the tax and regulatori system a consult document will be issu later thi spring to consid the option lloyd s i also propos to introduc a signific reform of the tax regim for lloyd s i propos to tax the gain on the dispos of asset which form the premium fund of lloyd s name in the same wai as those of corpor insur and i intend to replac the current reserv arrang with a better target reserv which should enhanc lloyd s abil to deal with the particularli volatil type of risk which make up most of their busi my propos will greatli simplifi the taxat of lloyd s lloyd s ha had a difficult time recent but it remain vital if london is to retain it pre emin posit in the world insur market taken togeth the reform i am propos will be revenu neutral small busi the measur i have announc so far will be of help particularli to larger busi but small firm plai a crucial role in our economi small busi do not follow the economi thei lead it that ha been demonstr time and time again in thi budget i shall set out some further propos which will help small busi to lead the recoveri onc again follow heavi loss in recent year the bank ar bound to be more cautiou in their lend in futur moreov the fall in properti price ha reduc the secur for their loan as the recoveri progress small firm mai therefor find that their prospect for expans ar increasingli threaten by a shortag of bank financ my first propos is direct at that problem the govern s loan guarante scheme help entrepreneur with viabl project but who do not have the track record or loan secur to attract suffici financ on their own it enabl them to borrow with a govern guarante usual for 70 per cent of the valu of the loan in return for pai a premium of 2 1 2 per cent on the guarante part of the loan in germani and the us a larg proport of lend to small busi is done at fix rate of interest by contrast in britain most borrow is link to the level of base rate i believ that mani small busi would benefit from make more us of fix rate financ which would give them more stabil and would enabl them to plan ahead i propos therefor to make a substanti reduct in the loan guarante scheme premium for guarante on fix rate lend thi will fall to 1 2 per cent and will i hope encourag more fix rate lend i also intend to reduc the premium on variabl rate loan to 1 1 2 per cent the premium will henceforth appli to the whole loan not just the guarante portion thi chang should take effect in the next month or so i also propos that the limit on the size of loan allow to such busi should be rais from pound 100 000 to pound 250 000 and the proport of the loan guarante increas from 70 per cent to 85 per cent my rt hon friend the presid of the board of trade and i will be take thi forward urgent with the bank cgt reform my second measur relat specif to entrepreneur who have built up success busi and now wish to sell them in order to start up a new on the current capit gain tax regim provid gener annual exempt to those who make regular capit gain from trade in share but it is much less gener to the entrepreneur typic he sell share in hi own compani onli onc and so ha onli on year s annual exempt to set against gain built up by hard work over mani year so for everi pound 100 taken out of the old compani at the margin he ha onli pound 80 to invest in a new on it is hardli surpris that entrepreneur complain that thei ar lock in by the cgt regim and prevent from invest their talent elsewher for thi reason i propos in futur to defer the payment of cgt for ani entrepreneur whose gain from the sale of hi own compani ar reinvest in anoth qualifi unquot trade compani or compani i know thi will be wide welcom by the ventur capit industri i also propos to relax the condit for cgt retir relief by reduc the qualifi sharehold from 25 per cent to 5 per cent and to extend thi relief to cover full time employe as well as director these chang will cost pound 50 million in a full year vat threshold i turn now to the vat regim which for mani small busi take up a great deal of time and can be a particular sourc of worri the best wai to help is to keep them out of the vat system altogeth i am therefor rais the vat threshold to the maximum extent possibl the new threshold will be pound 37 600 over the last coupl of year i have also announc measur to allow trader to reclaim vat on debt which remain unpaid after 12 month and to encourag firm to take advantag of the cash account scheme under which trader onli have to pai vat to custom when thei themselv have been paid by their custom i now intend to take thi further i propos to increas the ceil on turnov below which firm mai join the cash account scheme by pound 50 000 to pound 350 000 thi will allow an extra 15 000 busi to benefit on top of the 400 000 that qualifi alreadi i also intend to help busi which ar too big to take advantag of the scheme at present vat can be reclaim on ani invoic which remain unpaid after twelv month i propos to halv that qualifi period to six month these measur will give consider help to compani improv trader cashflow by some pound 150 million in the year ahead vat penalti in addit i have a further seri of reform to propos to the current system of vat penalti first i intend to focu the rule better so that onli larger error and the most persist offend will incur the misdeclar penalti thi will reduc the number of penalti impos by over 40 per cent second i propos to place a 3 year limit on the number of year interest that can be charg when tax ha been underpaid third i have decid to reform the vat default surcharg so that trader will be notifi sooner of default and surcharg at a lower rate and onli on larger default thi will make the surcharg system more effect while remov some 125 000 small trader from the default surcharg altogeth i know thi will be welcom by mani small busi keith report i have on final reform of the vat penalti system follow lord keith s 1983 review the govern conclud that it would be wrong to give custom discret over the level of vat penalti after consider debat thi conclus wa eventu accept by the hous but the controversi ha continu ever sinc and over time more and more peopl have come to believ that it is wrong to have a penalti regim which is almost entir automat i have consid thi matter afresh and conclud that the time ha come to make a chang i propos therefor that custom should be given some discret to mitig the penalti for some misdeclar to enabl them to take account of the individu circumst of the trader if necessari of cours the trader will still be abl to appeal to a vat tribun which will also have greater scope for discret these reform will put the vat complianc system onto a secur long term basi thei will be of most benefit to small busi for whom the burden of complianc is heaviest and i am sure that thei will be wide welcom on both side of the hous bloodstock mr deputi speaker i have alreadi announc my intent to extend valu ad tax to domest fuel and power from 1 april next year i now have on further announc to make on vat as the hous know it ha long been thi govern s intent to switch the burden of taxat from direct tax on incom to indirect tax on consum spend it is perhap less well known that britain ha on of the lowest effect rate of vat in the european commun against thi background and in a budget design to place the public financ on a sound foot i have inevit had to look veri carefulli at the whole structur of our current vat regim and particularli at whether all of our exist zero rate should be maintain some of these zero rate good for exampl food and water ar clearli amongst the most basic necess of life other for exampl sewerag and newspap perhap fall into a differ categori have reflect carefulli mr deputi speaker i have decid nonetheless not to extend the vat base beyond fuel and power i do howev have on further announc on vat which will i hope offer some consol to those hm who would rather be at cheltenham todai watch the champion hurdl for some time the bloodstock industri ha been concern about competit from other ec countri which levi a lower rate of vat on hors the singl market ha exacerb thi problem and creat a major incent to move bloodstock busi abroad threaten 30 000 job there have been intens discuss between the jockei club and custom and i am pleas to announc that a wai forward ha been found as a result of propos chang in the jockei club s rule owner who wish to do so will now be abl to organis their race activ in a more commerci wai thi in turn will enabl them to meet the normal busi test for vat registr and to claim credit for vat on purchas subject to the usual rule i know that registr on thi basi meet the industri s concern over thi problem no govern ha done more for race than thi on and quit rightli so for it is not onli an import industri but a vital part of our nation life thi measur will be welcom by the industri and by their mani support in thi hous ubr mr deputi speaker i have on final announc which will be of direct help to mani busi my last budget help mani thousand of firm by alter the busi rate transit arrang to acceler the gain of those who gain most from the chang in the system while freez real rate bill which would otherwis have risen substanti the freez appli for on year onli so mani busi now face a substanti increas in their rate bill in the year ahead of up to 20 per cent over and abov inflat on larg properti and up to 15 per cent on small properti it would i believ be wrong to impos such increas in present circumst i therefor propos for a further year to freez in real term the rate bill of those lose from the new system as a result of thi and last year s measur no busi will face a real increas in it rate bill in the year ahead and mani will benefit from reduct in cash term that mean that no bill will rise by more than 3 6 per cent the increas in the rpi in the year to last septemb subject to parliament s approv the govern will again pai extra sum into the busi rate pool to ensur that the incom of local author is not reduc my rt hon friend the secretari of state for the environ will shortli introduc a bill to implement these propos full detail will be publish todai in a press notic the new measur will reduc the total busi rate bill in england and wale next year by 2 6 per cent bill in scotland and northern ireland will likewis be reduc by 2 6 per cent in aggreg my rt hon friend the scottish and northern ireland secretari will be announc the detail these measur will again bring signific and earli benefit to mani thousand of busi throughout the unit kingdom about 800 000 busi properti will benefit the revenu cost is estim to be some pound 370m in 1993 94 and some pound 260m in 1994 95 mr deputi speaker taken togeth the measur i have announc will reduc the burden on busi by about pound 1bn in the year ahead i am sure that the whole hous will agre that thi is the best possibl us for the sum i have been abl to rais thi year nation lotteri and chariti the hous is awar of the govern s plan to introduc a nation lotteri from next year thi will provid a substanti increas in resourc for a number of good caus chariti sport the art the nation heritag and the millenium fund i have no doubt that the lotteri will be both popular and success the govern ha alwai made it clear that the nation lotteri will be tax in decid the tax rate i have taken into account the level of tax on other form of gambl and the extent to which spend is like to be divert from other tax activ much of cours will depend on how the lotteri develop and i shall keep the posit under review but for the first year of it oper i propos that nation lotteri ticket should be tax at a rate of 12 per cent exist societi and local author lotteri will be exempt win will incur no tax whatsoev i believ that these propos will ensur that the nation lotteri get off to a good start sinc 1979 the govern ha done an enorm amount to help chariti inde their special posit in societi is recognis in the substanti tax relief approach pound 1 billion which thei alreadi receiv and thei will also benefit from the new lotteri i now have two further chang to propos first i intend to rais the annual limit for incom tax relief under the payrol give scheme from pound 600 to pound 900 with effect from 6 april second i propos that the minimum gift attract tax relief for singl donat under the gift aid scheme should be reduc from pound 400 to pound 250 from todai these measur build on the principl that tax relief for chariti should focu on what individu give rather than what chariti themselv spend taken togeth thei will boost tax relief on donat to chariti by some pound 30m in a full year employ measur in the autumn statement the govern announc a number of measur to help the unemploi and in my budget i have set out my further propos to help busi and sustain recoveri the best wai to promot employ but we know from experi that unemploy mai continu to rise for a while even after growth ha resum that is a matter of great concern to the whole countri and it is a concern which i fulli share my rt hon friend the secretari of state for employ and i have therefor decid to take further special measur to help an extra 100 000 unemploi peopl first we have decid to provid more help for those who wish to set up their own busi under the busi start up scheme thi offer advic and financi assist and ha been on of the most success employ scheme we propos to offer an addit 10 000 place in 1993 94 that will give a direct boost to small busi creation and self employ in year ahead second my rt hon friend the secretari of state for employ propos to introduc a new initi to allow the long term unemploi to learn the practic skill thei need to find work resourc will be made avail to allow 30 000 long term unemploi peopl to take up full time vocat cours third it is wide agre that in everi commun there ar plenti of job need to be done and plenti of peopl who want to do them my rt hon friendth prime minist ha recent indic the import of offer more unemploi peopl the opportun to undertak some form of train or activ we ar therefor launch a new commun action programm to allow 60 000 of the long term unemploi to do part time work in their local commun organis by voluntari group those involv will be paid an allow base on their previou benefit rate plu a small premium the scheme will start as soon as possibl mr deputi speaker those who have been unemploi for a long time tend to lose touch with the job market and find it increasingli difficult to find an employ who want to take them on we propos to test in pilot scheme the feasibl and effect of a new approach where rather than pai benefit to the long term unemploi to do noth payment will instead be made for a limit period to an employ who recruit them employ take on peopl who have been out of work for at least 2 year will receiv a on year subsidi base on the benefit payment which would otherwis have been paid that subsidi will taper off as the period of employ progress pilot scheme us differ approach will be launch thi summer in four part of the countri if thei can be made to work thi could lead to perman job for the long term unemploi as the economi recov final the establish of train and enterpris council throughout the countri ha successfulli brought local busi peopl into the design and run of train and enterpris programm for the unemploi i now propos to offer the tec a new pound 25m fund my rt hon

will be an import criterion against which each applic will be judg these measur will cost pound 230m and will give special help to those who need it most includ disabl peopl the disabl will be given prioriti in the vocat educ initi and in commun action help us to build on our achiev in help the disabl back to work in the first nine month of 1992 93 the employ servic found job for 31 000 unemploi disabl peopl 25 per cent more than in the same period of 1991 92 i am sure the hous will welcom thi privat financ mr deputi speaker in my autumn statement i announc signific chang to the rule for the

significantli enhanc the transport infrastructur of the nation s capit second crossrail a public sector project first propos in 1989 to reduc congest in central london mr deputi speaker the govern remain commit to secur for london the benefit that crossrail will bring but we now believ it would be prefer to take thi project forward as a joint ventur with the privat sector the present propos for crossrail will therefor be re examin our aim will be to maximis the particip and financi involv of the privat sector and to secur the best possibl valu for monei for the taxpay on of the most ambiti civil engin project ever conceiv ha been made possibl by privat financ i refer of cours to the channel tunnel thi will provid a fast link between britain and pari cut journei time dramat but those time could be cut still further by reduc the time taken for journei within britain itself for that to happen a new rail link will be requir from london down to the channel tunnel itself thi will be a

flexibl and deregul labour market across the contin and we must continu to fight for free trade not just within the european union but between the union and the rest of the world the first essenti step is to secur a satisfactori conclus to the gatt round the public financ the second major risk to the recoveri in britain is the public financ the overrid need is to place the public financ on a sound foot that is the immedi task of the govern and the main theme of my budget todai busi can plan ahead with confid onli if it know that govern borrow is under control my task todai is to deliv

amount to a huge packag of extra help fifteen million peopl will benefit we shall be provid around pound 400m of extra help next year and around pound 1 1 4 bn extra in the year 1996 97 these massiv sum more than deliv the govern s firm commit to help the less well off group in societi thei extend that signific help to all our pension i am sure thei will be welcom by everyon who want to see revenu rais in a sensibl and fair wai public spend mr deputi speaker let me now turn to the govern s new spend plan for the rest of thi parliament in june the cabinet impos tight ceil on public spend over the next three year a real term freez in the new control total over the next two year with growth limit to 1 per cent a year thereaft in my view noth tougher ha been attempt sinc thi govern came to power in 1979 anyon who ha actual run on or more of the big depart of state know how unaccept it would be to contempl cut in the health servic in our educ system or in the resourc need to improv law and order in a modern and civilis societi no on can regard all public spend as a bad thing of cours more spend is not the onli wai to improv our public servic qualiti public servic also depend crucial on greater effici better valu for monei and where sensibl on the involv of privat sector monei manag and advic earlier thi year my rt hon friend the chief secretari launch a seri of fundament public expenditur review to establish more clearli what the govern s spend prioriti should be alreadi thi programm is produc dividend the first four review have plai a kei role in thi year s public expenditur survei i can now announc to the hous that overal even includ the packag of help with fuel bill the govern s new spend plan ar fulli consist with the tough limit agre by the cabinet in june for the next three year total govern expenditur will grow by substanti less than the project growth of the economi public spend will therefor fall as a proport of nation incom from around 45 per cent thi year to 42 1 2 per cent in 1996 97 to achiev thi we have start with a rigor approach to the govern s administr cost central govern run cost includ paybil will be frozen at thi year s cash level pai increas for public sector staff will therefor have to be paid for by greater effici or save in the cost of run govern but mr deputi speaker we have also had to conduct a search examin of spend on govern programm that examin began with the largest spend programm of all social secur social secur social secur spend is increas at an underli rate of more than 3 per cent a year in real term well abov the sustain growth rate of the economi as a whole if thi trend continu it will place a quit imposs burden on the work popul in the futur our children and our children s children if we do not plan the social secur programm properli we shall be unabl to give effect help to those who need it most a good social secur system under which the better off and peopl in work pai to support the poor and the disadvantag is an essenti featur of a modern civilis state in review the social secur budget the govern s object have been to ensur that the social secur system is better target on todai s real need and to make it simpler and less suscept to fraud job seeker s allow let me start mr deputi speaker with two propos design to help peopl back into work the present convolut system for support the unemploi includ two entir separ benefit incom support and unemploy benefit and two quit separ bureaucraci for deliv them the employ servic and the benefit agenc emploi between them no fewer than 44 000 civil servant to do the job we intend to cut through thi bureaucrat maze by introduc from april 1996 a singl benefit for the unemploi the job seeker s allow thi will align rate and rule and reduc the contributori element of the benefit from 12 to 6 month but it will also build on the success of the restart programm introduc in the 1980s by draw a much closer link between the receipt of benefit and the claimant s demonstr willing to look for work and it will be reinforc by a strengthen of restart itself by an extens of commun action place and by the introduct of pilot scheme offer intens guidanc assess and a financi incent to long term unemploi peopl who need it most famili credit our second propos should have a more immedi impact the hous will be awar of the rise level of concern about the caus consequ and cost of the growth of lone parenthood in thi countri there ar mani lone parent and marri mother as well who have no desir to remain trap in poverti or depend on benefit but who believ that thei have no choic as a result of the cost of childcar thei simpli cannot afford to go out to work that cannot be right the govern ha therefor decid to introduc next autumn a new allow avail to all those on famili credit who need to pai for childcar thi will be worth up to pound 28 each week per famili and it should help ten of thousand of mother to get back into work and off incom support i am sure it will be warmli welcom by all those who want to see the poorest parent back on the road to financi independ i turn next to statutori sick pai at the moment employe who go sick and meet the qualifi condit ar entitl to receiv sick pai at specifi rate after the first three dai of sick their employ ar entitl to reimburs from the govern for 80 per cent of the cost we have no plan to reduc the sick pai entitl of employe but with effect from next april we propos to stop reimburs the cost of statutori sick pai for the largest employ for smaller compani the current special exempt will be extend at present those with nation insur bill of less than pound 16 000 a year ar fulli reimburs after the first six week of each statutori sick pai claim i propos to increas that threshold to pound 20 000 to bring more compani into the scheme and to provid full reimburs after onli four week two third of all employ will therefor continu to get help employ nation insur contribut the transfer of these cost from the taxpay to busi will reduc public spend by around pound 700m a year over the next three year but to ensur that busi as a whole doe not lose my rt hon friend and i have decid to reduc the main rate of employ nation insur contribut by 0 2 per cent from next april thi mean that for well manag compani with low sick rate there will be a net reduct in the cost of emploi peopl other compani will have a much sharper incent to improv their manag of sick leav and to take a greater interest in the health of their employe but with unemploy in britain still far too high it is vital that we do everyth we can to reduc the cost of provid employ have review the posit i have therefor decid that even in a year of acut fiscal stringenc we can and should go further long term unemploi peopl ar most like to find unskil and semi skill work at the lower end of the pai scale to improv compani incent and abil to provid that kind of job i propos again from next april to reduc each of the lower rate of employ nation insur contribut by on full percentag point overal the reduct in nation insur contribut i have announc will reduc the cost to employ of provid job by pound 830m next year rise to pound 1bn by 1996 97 well abov the overal cost to employ of the reform to statutori sick pai in our discuss within the european union my rt hon friend the prime minist and i have

govern ha decid to make a number of chang to the benefit which will refocu it for the futur on those who ar genuin incap of work my rt hon friend propos to introduc a new benefit incapac benefit to replac sick and invalid benefit the new benefit will involv a tighter and more object medic test the govern ha alwai made clear it intent to bring the tax treatment of invalid benefit into line with that of the retir pension and most other incom replac benefit now that the necessari administr arrang can be made i propos from april 1995 to bring it replac the new incapac benefit into tax state pension ag final i can announc on further decis which will have littl immedi effect but will make a consider differ to the afford of the modern welfar state in the next centuri after care consider the govern ha decid that the state pension ag should eventu be equalis at 65 the chang will be phase in over 10 year start in the year 2010 so it will not affect anyon current ag 44 or older by the year 2020 the state pension ag in britain will be broadli in line with that of most of our industri competitor though we will still have more gener arrang than in the us where the pension ag is to be equalis at 67 all develop countri ar make similar chang for similar reason women nowadai tend to spend more of their live in paid employ thei also live longer than men pension scheme need to recognis thi and end the current discrimin between the sex in the next centuri the ratio of work peopl to retir peopl will fall sharpli and the burden on taxpay will rise the govern s decis will moder those burden eventu by some pound 5bn a year and so help to ensur that thei ar sustain the basic pension is and will remain a cornerston of the welfar state the govern is commit to it and to retain it valu

scotland and northern ireland thi will bring signific relief next year to over 600 000 busi properti throughout the uk it will cost a littl over pound 100m next year small busi but my particular prioriti thi year ha been to help small busi in my opinion the biggest contribut ani chancellor can make to reduc unemploy over the medium term is to ensur that the condit ar in place for new busi to becom establish and for small busi to grow as a countri we gener plenti of bud entrepreneur and ani number of good invent and idea yet all too often those idea stai on the draw board as monei is channel instead into the safer larger compani my propos seek to address three separ problem face small busi todai the burden of regul the shortag of extern financ and cashflow deregul i can announc

expens can be out of all proport to the benefit when i wa at the depart of trade and industri i continu press for a chang to thi my predecessor announc consult in the march budget i can now announc the conclus the presid of the board of trade and i have decid that most compani with a turnov between pound 90 000 and pound 350 000 a year in futur need onli get an independ account s report on whether the compani s account correctli reflect it book but for the 40 per cent of compani with turnov of less than pound 90 000 we propos to take the deregul a step further for these small compani the audit requir will be abolish altogeth but i don t just want to lighten the burden of regul i believ that posit step ar requir to increas the flow of risk capit into small busi capit gain tax for manag and employe to leav steadi job and take a chanc by go into busi on their own the risk must be worthwhil at 40 per cent our top rate of incom tax is the lowest in the european union and i intend to keep it that wai but our capit gain tax regim still bear disproportion on the success entrepreneur in 1991 we increas the capit gain tax relief for busi peopl who sell up on retir by provid a complet exempt from capit gain tax on the first pound 150 000 of capit gain and a half exempt on the next pound 450 000 i now propos to increas these limit to pound 250 000 and pound 750 000 respect

consult paper flesh out the detail enterpris invest scheme in my view there remain too a strong case for encourag direct equiti invest in unquot trade compani i propos to introduc a new scheme the enterpris invest scheme to do just that the enterpris invest scheme will differ from the old busi expans scheme in sever import respect to target the monei where we want it to go properti relat invest will be exclud up front tax relief will be limit to 20 per cent but ani loss on invest will qualifi for incom tax and capit gain tax relief and all capit gain within the scheme will be entir free of capit gain tax the limit for investor will be pound 100 000 a year most import of all to help those who ar look to invest their expertis as well as their monei peopl previous unconnect with the compani thei invest in will be abl to take up paid directorship the cost of the new scheme could eventu rise to some pound 50m a year taken togeth with my propos on capit gain tax and the new ventur capit trust i believ it could gener substanti new invest in the unquot compani sector late payment final i turn to the problem of small compani cashflow there is on issu which year after year top the list of budget represent made to all of us by the small busi commun the problem of late payment there can be noth more frustrat than deliv a qualiti product on time at a competit price and then find that you don t get paid for month late payment wreak havoc with cashflow and for mani small firm thei can make the differ between surviv and failur the habit of late payment is corrod our busi cultur i am quit sure that it need to be dealt with there ar mani option for tackl thi and my rhf the presid of the board of trade and i will be look at two in particular first a new british standard for

my first respons as chancellor is to get public expenditur under the firmest possibl control i have alreadi announc that the govern s new spend plan fulli meet the remit agre by cabinet in june but when the hous come to studi the red book it will see that the figur for the new control total in each of the next three year ar differ from those set out in the march budget and the cash ceil agre by the cabinet in june mr deputi speaker the explan for thi differ is simpl the cabinet ha decid to establish new spend plan which ar not just consist with the ceil set in june we have decid to set plan which in each of the next three year ar lower than the june ceil our spend plan for the come year have been reduc by more than pound 3 1 2 bn the new control total for next year will be pound 3 1 2 bn below the level we set last year and pound 8 billion below the plan that we first set two year ago and that is not all in 1995 96 we have reduc the new control total by pound 1 1 2 bn and in 1996 97 by nearli pound 3bn take into account lower debt interest payment result from lower borrow i expect that as a direct result of the budget total public spend over the next three year will be around pound 10bn less than we assum in march includ also the reduct in cyclic spend as the economi recov and other chang the total reduct in public spend over the next three year compar to the march budget project will be no less than pound 15bn those public expenditur save dramat reduc my need to rais tax to get the borrow requir down as a result of that achiev and onli becaus of that i can now confirm
