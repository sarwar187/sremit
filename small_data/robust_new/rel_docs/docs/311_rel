possibl syria and beyond in spring and summer prevail wind in thi area could carri the radioact cloud from thi armenian electroatom station to iraq the arabian gulf coast and israel the russian border guard forc have been establish on the vast central asian territori to protect the border of the ci state as well as the russian border the border post and center have no secur cover and therefor thei

of russia befor the russian secur ministri wa disband the ministri s local bodi protect the rear of the border forc there as for the russian counterintellig servic thei have no such local bodi and therefor the rear of the border forc will remain unprotect howev the most danger situat is manifest in the sector of the militari industri complex the economi and the nuclear complex where the situat

the possess of peopl who will us these terribl weapon without hesit and without even think of the grave consequ of thi step just for the sake of achiev their selfish and nation object what make the situat even more complic is that most of the republ that becam independ of the former ussr have on their territori some of the institut factori and scientif center and laboratori which in on wai or anoth ar affili with the militari industri complex the nuclear complex the product of chemic weapon or product of mass destruct weapon sever of these institut which us to be secret ar now locat on the territori of newli independ state whose leadership do not know how to dispos of them in fact thei believ that the best solut is to sell them along with their mean of product and their technolog to the highest bidder regardless of who it is if the nuclear materi and their technolog were sold with some caution and secreci the mass destruct weapon and the technolog of their product and even the chemic weapon were sold publicli here ar some exampl in novemb 1993 a medium size ship with 40 famili of russian refuge from the citi of krasnovodsk in turkmenistan on board arriv in the citi of astrakhan among these famili there were six famili whose breadwinn us to work at on of the secret workshop of the ammunit depot of the former soviet war fleet at thi workshop all the nuclear charg of the torpedo and sea mine were test and most of them were sent to the black sea fleet follow the disintegr of the ussr the new state of turkmenistan decid that it did not need these charg in the depot becaus it doe not have a fleet or naval air forc unit the entir depot wa sold in on year the sea mine workshop wa also sold the alreadi made product wa sold and the equip wa sold later the expert who return to russia said that iranian and pakistani were among the buyer the buyer offer the engin and the technician work at the workshop contract to work on the equip back in their countri for five year some of the former offic of the caspian sea fleet sign contract and left with the equip after work for more than a year and a half without salari arriv in astrakhan said that the famili of other offic lead a veri miser life in the open and that thei cannot return to russia in the same wai the gunpowd factori in the town of shusta place name as publish in the suburb of namangan in uzbekistan wa sold when it wa built in 1910 thi factori us to produc gunpowd later it becam a huge war institut special in produc air drop bomb it wa on of the three soviet factori where cluster bomb and vacuum bomb which ar consid a kind of mass destruct weapon ar assembl after the break up of the soviet union uzbekistan no longer need the factori and there wa no wai to convert it to civilian product work stop in the factori and the russian fear nationalist clash began to leav uzbekistan for russia ukrain and belaru the local central govern in tashkent began to sell the veri expens equip and technolog that wa in us at that time the same thing happen at the design offic which can be compar to a small research institut in thi field the string of buyer again includ iran and pakistan follow by india indonesia and iraq we can give dozen of exampl of thi kind the weapon of mass destruct spread all over the third world from all the republ of the former soviet union becaus of the lack of control and protect exercis in the past by the kgb these weapon can easili fall into the hand of irrespons adventur here is anoth exampl a secret laboratori which carri out near product level scientif research in chemic weapon and laser in the town of at bashi a suburb of the kirghiz town of naryn wa lost kirghizia did not need thi laboratori the new nation could not us it or convert it product becaus it had no train russian personnel who us to work there the russian left kirghizia in a hurri after nationalist sentiment rose onli the wall of that laboratori remain where is the equip where ar the document ar thei in china iran pakistan iraq or in anoth countri veri few kirghiz figur know the fact and thei prefer to remain silent in none of the ci state where nuclear weapon ar distribut do we find ani govern monitor of radioact and nuclear radiat except in russia where a special committe roscomatomnadzur as publish or the govern s committe to supervis nuclear materi exist howev the committe s duti and resourc ar veri limit monitor is confin to ascertain that the storag and us of nuclear materi doe not harm the health of peopl or the environ at best committe employe can record a radiat leak or a violat of the rule for store nuclear materi the tragedi todai is that the state ha not organ the protect of materi and relat technolog against ordinari theft illeg sale or smuggl abroad protect that wa the job of state bodi the counterintellig servic wa rob of thi job and the inform branch which belong to the kgb wa given the task of fight nuclear terror howev thi bodi ha no local branch in the russian area where the nuclear site exist it is doubt if such branch will be establish in the near futur becaus thi is not within the duti of the kgb inform branch which should oper outsid the countri therefor the countri s power nuclear establish which includ the nuclear fuel factori for the electroatom station ship reactor and plutonium weapon factori as well as the research center the nuclear

the signatori to coordin effort regard maintain unifi price of tradabl nuclear wast thi mean ukrain and kazakhstan have not abandon trade in nuclear and radioact materi the onli thing thei care about
