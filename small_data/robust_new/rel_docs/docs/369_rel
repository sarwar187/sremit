not quit the same richard said that he had a less than support reaction to karen s announc just after he had begun a six week drug rehabilit program that she wa plan to record an album without him i probabl said someth like you re just abandon ship just take off and do what you want to do i wa feel sorri for myself he said it wa a combin of feel i wa be abandon which wa anyth but the case look back on it and think thi wa a perfect time for her to get some treatment for her disord so i wa not happi and i told her as much richard who produc and arrang the carpent long string of hit also acknowledg that he felt threaten by karen s team up with anoth produc i m human and it did cross my mind that someth could come out of thi and just explod at which time i would be go through a number of emot i d be happi for karen becaus i alwai felt that she should have been in the top 5 on the other hand be sensit and feel i d done a good job for the carpent i would have been a littl bit upset in a separ interview from hi new york offic produc phil ramon discuss hi and karen s object on the album we were think two thing how do we make a record that doesn t sound like the carpent and what

these song kind of like stepchildren karen wa alwai the sweetheart of a m and herb and jerri react almost like it wa their teen ag daughter i wa mess with alpert who wrote the liner note to the carpent debut album and found the team s breakthrough hit close to you declin to be interview for thi stori richard carpent rememb give karen a mix but essenti lukewarm review of the solo project i probabl said it wa veri nice he said it certainli is well produc and well assembl but some of it wa disco and i m not a disco fan and i thought she wa sing a littl bit too high on some of the song and carpent appli some not so subtl pressur on karen by tell her how eager he wa to begin work on the next carpent album i wa much better by then and wa kick myself for what i had done to my life he said

listen to the tape is it the mix but ramon said that karen wa ultim proud of the album it wa the first step to her stand on her own and also the last chanc i truli believ that if she had made it through thi she could have gone on to have a long career ramon said a lot of the pop song and movi song and duet of the 80s would have been her a voic like karen s rich womanli come along onc everi 20
