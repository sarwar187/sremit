with her stepmoth s help schneider said she found a clinic and had the abort and that wa it in stark contrast lodato who becam pregnant a second time even though she took birth control pill said that five year after her second abort she still ha bout of emot pain right now i feel that from about six month ago i ve complet forgiven myself for what i ve done said lodato a full time staffer at a

with a religi organ or other organ whose main purpos is to make women feel asham and guilti about have an abort or contempl get on she said if you surround yourself with peopl who think abort is evil

where student show a lower rate of hospit than those in school without a clinic littl effect seen michael bernstam a hoover institut senior research special in teen pregnanc issu said hi studi show that the rate of illegitim pregnanc or abort among teen ager ar littl affect on wai or the other by famili plan servic at school base clinic i can understand why school would like such servic becaus thei see real girl not just statist who ar pregnant or sexual activ and mayb in some case thei can help by talk them out of pregnanc bernstam said but i believ the real benefit in thi area for a clinic come from help the health of futur babi becaus these girl who get pregnant usual have less access to prenat care ar less like to stai in school and have a higher birth mortal rate and have more babi with low birth weight which we know bring problem down the line bernstam suggest that a wide rang of social servic to stem dropout rate and to boost self esteem if offer at a health clinic might have more of an effect in lower pregnanc rate than sexual counsel alon if you can show a girl that there ar greater opportun ahead that complet school and go to colleg is realist then you don t have to worri as much about pregnanc he said bernstam said he understand the philosoph posit of the cathol church recal a 1976 audienc he had with pope paul vi i told him that if the church had enough time

sociologist kingslei davi is quot in bishop maher s pastor letter as decri contracept as a technolog devic to try and solv a social control social disciplin problem but davi said in an interview that while he doe believ contracept alon is no solut he would have no problem with behavior counsel and contracept within the context of a comprehens clinic i see noth wrong if a propos is for a gener clinic with pregnanc issu as on compon he said hoover and school district administr sai too mani teen ager have a lack of knowledg about human sexual about pregnanc and about where to get help either for prevent or pregnanc care at present district nurs can provid no famili plan counsel and can onli suggest that worri student seek help from agenc such as plan parenthood or door of hope the three small program in the district to help teen ager who ar pregnant or have a child continu their school have wait list but propon insist that their overwhelm reason for the clinic propos is to provid

in the east san diego area need better health care he believ that opposit would be much less if a school base health clinic ban all reproduct relat servic but ad that he doubt propon would be interest in such a limit penko said he think there is a desir for what he call social engin if their concern is genuin for health then why not get privat fund to hire anoth nurs or two more nurs and let the nurs refer to outsid clinic and tell the student how to get there penko said hi own parish school refer children with health problem to a low cost clinic sever block from the church he and other oppon also label as a sham the need for parent consent as propos by the hoover committe becaus of a california law permit minor to have access to reproduct servic without the approv of parent but lo angel clinic offici and san diego citi school attornei tina dyer sai the law allow a minor to receiv such treatment onli if the provid whether a doctor or clinic ha a polici of consent to offer those servic
