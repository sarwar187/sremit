part in the argument that the larg popul ha a bear on the right to exist and develop of the chines popul and that popul ha to be control is the environment capac for china s popul also call life

resourc compris mani indefinit factor 3 it believ that becaus human live condit differ in a thousand wai environment capac is an indetermin factor howev judg by the continu in popul develop and consid the present state of scienc a rough approxim of environment capac is possibl after prolong on the spot investig and research the center for research on the nation condit and the natur resourc investig conting of the chines academi of scienc came up with the figur of 1 5 to 1 6 billion peopl as the highest figur that china s entir natur environ could accommod and that the capac would be below 1 billion if there were shortag of some resourc china s popul which is now 1 1 billion peopl will increas by sheer inertia to at least 1 5 to 1 6 billion at it peak in the next centuri accord to forecast accept by the major of expert thi allow the assumpt that the scope of china s popul will in futur reach the upper limit of what resourc and environ can accommod the argument that it huge popul justifi china s control of popul growth is thu be support by the intellig of natur scientist the proposit that scientif and technolog progress can expand the life support capac is correct but such expans ha it limit the more so sinc at present it doe not yet manifest that abil for the last 10 odd year theoret base for china s famili plan and popul control ha all along been the marxist theori on the two kind of product accord to thi theori the ratio between the increas of human reproduct and the increas in the reproduct of materi resourc is the most fundament proport in human affair as both kind of product must be in a state of mutual congruiti prior to reform and open up china s averag annual rate of econom growth wa around 6 percent while averag annual popul growth wa 2 percent so that the ratio between the two wa about 3 to 1 in certain year econom growth rate had slow down while popul growth rate had risen to abov 2 5 percent so that the ratio becam on of 2 to 1 or even less at that time it wa veri convinc to sai base on these figur that the two kind of product were mutual incongru while famili plan and control of popul growth were yet veri smoothli be carri out after reform and open up china achiev a new and higher level of econom growth maintain annual averag of around 9 percent famili plan wa also veri success dure the third period of peak birth the popul s birth rate and fertil rate show a declin tendenc the averag annual rate of popul growth wa around 1 5 percent at that time the ratio between the growth rate of the two kind of product wa about 6 to 1 or about doubl the former ratio of 3 to 1 in 1992 the situat wa particularli strike the econom growth rate wa 12 8 percent while the rate of popul growth declin to 1 28 percent so that the ratio between the two kind of product wa 10 to 1 in the face of thi new situat peopl can t help ask whether congruiti between the two kind of product ha alreadi been achiev and if not when would such inde be achiev on the problem of how congruiti is to be comput between the two kind of product there ha never been a clear explan sinc the start of the theori and it should now be the time to answer thi question actual practic and the mani question and perplex in peopl s percept demand that theori provid the answer and that a scientif and convinc exposit be produc it seem the onli feasibl wai and the on that is most commonli us is to studi the proport relationship between human reproduct and materi product and to subject the growth rate and the speed in both to a comparison howev us thi method to assess whether there is congruiti between the two kind of product also ha it limit 1 it can onli reflect the speed of growth but will not reveal the origin level 2 it cannot reflect the present level attain by the two 3 it will onli reflect the ultim product figur but cannot reflect the relationship between popul and the variou kei element of product especi the variou natur resourc and environment resourc 4 it is unsuit for cross comparison of domest and foreign condit in my opinion the best yardstick to check whether the two kind of product ar mutual congruou is still the per capita index the per capita index is the link between human reproduct and materi product as a most direct and the simplest indic it equit separ product volum gross nation product and reflect the condit of materi product such as fix asset infrastructur motiv power assembl instal capac etc accord to the total popul figur for the variou time period a larger popul caus the per capita index to get smaller thi then is the popul s denomin effect the reason for china s low per capita index is first of all the backward of it product forc or on mai sai the insuffici of thi numer while the excess larg popul and the continu popul inflat in the denomin ar element that will undoubtedli prevent the per capita index from go up for a long time some believ that popul is insignific as denomin if onli the volum of the numer is increas that thi will possibl rais the per capita index of cours it is correct to pai great attent to the denomin i e product volum develop product increas the denomin by everi possibl mean is a kei demand in china s econom construct as without such effort rais the per capita index would be like water without a sourc howev disregard popul as effect in the denomin would disregard the emin effect of the huge popul volum on the per capita index mani of china s product have been develop veri rapidli for instanc grain meat aquat product cotton cotton cloth coal cement steel glass etc and their product rank at the top or among the top level of world product but comput on a per capita basi product is low in world rank a fact that can onli be attribut to the excess larg denomin popul the per capita index reflect the relationship between the two kind of product and also show that it is the huge popul volum that is the fundament caus for china s low per capita index fast econom develop combin with slow popul growth can bring about a rise in the origin backward per capita index on the other hand china s per capita resourc index which is so veri far behind the averag world level arabl land forestri land sweet water resourc ar onli on third on ninth and on quarter respect of averag world level will steadili deterior further becaus of the increas in popul it is not difficult to forese that the dai will come befor the middl of the next centuri when the per capita arabl land in china will be below 1 mu the huge popul volum will lead to an incongru between popul and resourc util and thi will be an even greater challeng for china s surviv and develop the parti report at it 14th nation congress state assess the right or wrong the success or failur in the perform of ani sector must in the final analysi accept the criterion of whether it ha contribut to the develop of the product forc of the socialist societi to the overal enhanc of the nation strength of the socialist state and to the improv of the peopl s live standard thi criterion is also complet applic when we examin the mutual congruiti between china s human reproduct and materi product china s present gross nation product averag out accord to it popul is for certain import product and for the infrastructur for fix asset etc at the bottom of world rank and some do not even attain the level of the develop countri thi clearli indic that there is still a larg dispar to overcom if china is to attain mutual congruiti between the two product when famili plan wa first start in china in the 1970 s the most effect argument in it propaganda wa that china alreadi had a veri larg base popul figur it popul growth wa rapid and the ag structur of it popul wa a youth on at that time women in the rural area gave birth on the averag to five children and children below 15 year of ag account for over 35 percent of the total popul when it come to our present dai effect implement of famili plan ha veri effect reduc the birth rate and nationwid averag is alreadi approach replac level i e maintain the level of simpl reproduct in the citi especi in the larg citi and in some provinc it is alreadi well below the replac level the rate of annual natur popul growth ha also declin from abov 2 percent to 1 5 percent which is a veri favor level in the third world in some provinc citi and counti there ar alreadi symptom of a neg popul growth in some region the popul of below 15 year of ag account for onli on quarter and even onli on fifth of the total popul figur which ar among the lowest figur throughout the world in the abov state three term us to character the situat in china the statement about china s veri larg basic popul figur is the onli term that is not yet outdat but the explan given for the natur of china s famili plan it purpos and it task ar we feel somewhat oversimplifi and requir new supplement and a systemat exposit china s famili plan ha chines characterist and must not be consid as ident with famili plan in other countri although in translat the same word is us thi is inde a loss of truth that occur here in the translat first in china the scope of famili plan is on that cover the entir societi it start out from a macro overview and from consider of the interest of the entir societi famili plan in other countri start out from a microscop view and from the particular number of children and particular birth interv in the plan of individu famili and individu person second in china famili plan is conduct as on of the function of govern while abroad it is mostli undertaken by privat organ third in china famili plan start out from the realiti of china alwai regard control of popul volum and rais the qualiti of the popul thi mainli refer to eugen excel and excel in child rais as on uniform entiti which is differ from famili plan abroad where restrict of birth is the on and onli object in china eugen excel and excel in child rais ar indispens precondit for the consolid of the low birth rate and thi is becom more and more import follow the actual achiev of low level of birth fourth in china s famili plan the overal total of all birth is the result of macro consider and is therefor object produc a cushion effect in the distribut and sex of the popul and on the adjust of the ag structur at differ time between urban and rural region and between differ district judg by it object task and method famili plan with chines characterist is an organ compon of the construct of social with chines characterist it is an indispens link in the effort to build up china into a prosper strong democrat and cultur rich countri with accomplish socialist modern the deeper and more remot object of china s famili plan is to render servic to the modern of china s popul thi demand that it make contribut toward modern of the type of popul reproduct modern of the popul qualiti modern of the type of popul structur and toward a healthi ag of the popul the burden of thi work dure the entir initi stage of social will be heavi and the endeavor will be a protract on famili plan is a basic project in the struggl of the chines peopl for their right to exist and develop under no circumst must there be ani relax becaus an extrem small group of foreign obstin lump it togeth with question of human right the work must be resolut continu and perfect in recent year implement of the central committe and the state council resolut for a strengthen of famili plan work and strict control of popul growth ha result in a remark reduct of the chines birth rate to have achiev thi success dure period of peak birth is highli commend but must certainli not be a reason to relax further effort first on of the major reason for the present declin in birth and fertil rate is the elev marriag ag for women of childbear ag and the reduct of repeat birth but after some time there could be a relaps and there ar inde still mani area of high childbirth so that we must not lower our guard in thi respect second china ha a popul of over 300 million women of childbear ag the social econom and cultur situat ha not yet reach the turn point when fewer childbirth would be demand spontan consolid the past achiev of famili plan still requir much propagandist work and work in servic to societi on must not expect that the work ha now been done onc and for all if a relaps would be allow to occur the task would requir doubl the effort for onli half the result third popul growth develop in a wave pattern after a peak occur there is bound to be anoth peak 20 odd year later we ar present at the top of the third peak of childbirth and in the next centuri there is bound to occur the fourth peak of childbirth though of a somewhat more moder dimens we must under no circumst be shortsight about it fourth popul growth possess it own inertia even if the birth rate arriv at the replac level popul mai still continu to grow when the birth rate in the present develop countri reach replac level it will take anoth 30 to 50 year until zero popul growth is achiev sinc reform and open up some labor and talent market have appear in the urban and rural area of china and by have a direct meet of suppli and demand it wa possibl to channel some manpow and some talent to place where thei can be more effect thi is benefici for the develop of product forc and is a start in break down the pattern of manpow distribut of the plan economi china is in the process of establish a system of socialist market economi thi new situat is also pose new challeng for our popul theori 1 popul reproduct is the natur foundat for reproduct of the work forc popul if the work forc is subject to market regul must popul birth also be regul by the market economi 2 all develop countri without except ar oper under the system of market economi without govern interfer in popul reproduct thei all have low birth rate and some have reach or ar about to reach zero popul increas final opinion ar voic in china and abroad that after china ha institut market economi it will onli requir the proper develop of it economi to have it birth rate quit natur go down and popul growth to be low or even zero in 1984 at the second intern popul confer in mexico the us deleg openli declar that china will onli be abl to resolv it popul problem by institut a free economi hi purpos wa obvious to have china abandon it present famili plan polici and have china adopt a laissez fair attitud in matter of birth control but there is absolut no wai that we could be dupe into do that under the new situat there ha to be a further emancip of mind and renov of concept in our research of popul theori judg by the actual condit prevail in china regul by the market of popul reproduct is definit not an object or demand of the establish of a system of socialist market economi first in china famili plan and popul control is view from the angl of the societi as a whole while the market mechan can regul onli a part of the work forc and cannot directli influenc birth of the entir popul there is furthermor a time gap of at least 15 to 20 year between the birth of a popul and it have grown up into work forc in our fast chang time it would be unrealist to consid manpow need 20 year henc on the basi of present manpow need actual what the market primarili influenc is popul movement and the demand for train a popul of work ag but not the problem of reproduct of the work forc popul second the labor market is present not yet suffici develop in china at the present stage and inform is also not effect spread some direct ar fals and erron it is therefor not possibl to guid famili by famili household by household toward spontan restrict birth there will alwai be a part of the peopl that will not exercis restraint in childbirth in a macro overview of the situat we see that china ha alreadi a huge conting of surplu manpow reli onli on market regul to slow down the manpow increas and as a consequ automat reduc the birthrat is unrealist third popul reproduct is not at all complet restrain by econom factor but to a consider extent influenc by social and cultur factor and by the forc of ethnic custom and habit thi is so becaus market economi reli on such econom element as the suppli demand relat which frequent do not have a regulatori effect the more so sinc mani region in

offset by high product it can no longer claim to be a countri with low labor cost at the end of 1991 hourli wage cost in the textil industri total 2 80 in tunisia compar to 1 40 in morocco 1 30 in hungari and 0 30 in china to overcom their depend on europ the two maghreb countri have tri to diversifi their market at the end of 1991 the uma arab maghreb union wa absorb less than 8 percent of their export morocco ha been more success in penetr larg market such as the unit state which requir larg quantiti the diversif of export product start earlier in tunisia and is more advanc there than in morocco partial process raw materi ar come to constitut less and less of total export over half of tunisia s export now consist of finish product notabl textil and cloth compar to less than on third of morocco s on top of slower european demand and fierc competit from asia and east europ morocco and tunisia ar also have to face intern competit in their own market with the open of their border to import trade balanc have suffer in recent year under the combin effect of slower export and soar import the deficit in the tunisian trade balanc rose from 1 35 billion in 1991 to 2 4 billion in 1992 the rate at which import ar cover by export 62 percent in 1992 is at it lowest level sinc 1986 although moroccan import have been reduc the rate of cover ha grown wors fall to 56 percent in 1992 the trade balanc deficit grew from 2 4 billion to nearli 3 billion between 1991 and 1992 but a 40 percent increas in tourism earn and an 8 percent increas in transfer from moroccan resid abroad total 2 billion made it possibl to contain the deficit in current oper tunisia which reli on mass tourism receiv more visitor but when it come to revenu morocco still hold first place tunisia record 24 million overnight stai in 1993 and 1 billion in earn while morocco earn nearli 1 2 billion from 11 million overnight stai the explan for that differ is simpl not onli ha morocco invest in more profit up market tourism but intern tour oper sell the tunisian product more cheapli the french firm new frontier is offer a week in april at a three star hotel in hammamet with full board for less than 3 000 french franc fr compar to the same thing in agadir for about fr4 000 3 confid and foreign invest smaller budget deficit a rise in the rate of save a lessen of the burden of foreign debt an open up to trade and deregul have led foreign investor to regain confid in the two countri morocco s foreign exchang reserv in 1992 total 3 7 billion the equival of six month of import compar to onli five week of import four year ago while those in tunisia total 927 million the equival of less than two month of import and that is not all sinc the gulf war foreign direct invest have been return thei amount to close to 200 million in tunisia in 1992 compar to 80 million in 1990 morocco thank especi to it diplomaci and the appeal of it domest market doe much better in term of volum in 1992 foreign manna pass the 500 million mark compar to 165 million in 1990 but in term of popul morocco s perform 20 per capita is below that of tunisia 23 50 the profit of an industri invest is compar in the two maghreb countri sai jean pierr prouteau presid of the cepia center for industri promot in africa but tunisia is still the champion when it come to attract foreign pme small and medium size busi to it territori between 1990 and 1992 no fewer than 60 medium size factori were establish there everi year and while the flow of capit weaken in 1993 the reason wa that investor were await the new invest code which wa promulg last decemb the tunisian invest promot agenc api is repres in all the western capit and welcom foreign invest on the spot french moroccan partnership program on the other hand have been suspend sinc 1990 there ar sever reason for thi tension between moroccan author and the former french socialist govern the reorgan of the industri develop offic odi which ha been under wai for three year and a lack of interest by the cgem moroccan gener econom feder the moroccan employ associ in pme and small busi the result as jean pierr prouteau goe on to sai is that if a manufactur want to set up a busi in the maghreb the french employ associ direct him to tunisia where the recept facil ar oper if an investor choos morocco he can reli onli on hi own person contact ar foreign investor interest onli in export activ no sai on of the maghreb repres of the swedish food packag firm tetra pak which oper in partnership with local manufactur in both countri the main object of our invest in morocco is to satisfi domest demand wherea in tunisia most of our product is for export the main concern then ar these in the case of morocco to be sure of get paid within a reason amount of time and in the case of tunisia to find foreign market 4 progress and standard of live in morocco structur progress is not realli be reflect in a higher standard of live growth is still inadequ popul growth of 2 7 percent per year cancel out growth in the gdp by just that much social inequ which caus unrest and ar therefor fear by foreign investor ar obviou accord to the undp un develop program 7 9 million moroccan some 30 percent of the popul still live below the poverti line the rise in consum price ha been halt but the minimum wage total bare 1 400 dirham about 850 french franc wherea the rent on a modest three room apart in casablanca easili exce 2 500 dirham about fr1 500 the popul problem is less seriou in tunisia where birth control ha been effect and where popul growth ha been reduc to 2 percent per year thi mean that at the same rate of econom growth per capita incom in tunisia rise more quickli than in morocco in addit social inequ ar much less pronounc in tunisia although thei ar tend to reappear accord to the undp 1 4 million tunisian 16 percent of the popul now live below the poverti line compar to 73 percent just after independ a genuin middl class

futur of our peopl text the demograph chang that have taken place in lithuania dure the last four or five year have broken with long term trend and have creat a new demograph situat it veri new is as frighten as ar it unclear implic more and more often we hear the warn cry will we surviv for the first time ever in peacetim in 1992 the popul of lithuania began to declin it drop by ten thousand in 1992 and by 12 6 thousand in 1993 thi declin is not infrequ us to illustr conclus about fate demograph chang and even about the disappear of the nation howev as the overal popul declin the number of rural and urban dweller ar shift not onli in differ but in what ar to us unaccustom direct the number of rural resid which heretofor had declin ha been grow for three year while the number of urban resid ha declin therefor befor we draw similar conclus it would make sens to analyz the caus and mean of these chang furthermor there is the danger of overestim secondari phenomena of attach special import to them while overlook the primari on it is import to lai bare the natur of the recent demograph chang which of them will determin our demograph prospect and how well do thei conform with our demograph vision is it veri import that the popul keep grow perhap it is more import to know why it grow and what sort of demograph futur will be brought about by the chang that ar take place prior to the end of the last decad lithuania wa character by a constant and by the standard of other european countri fairli larg growth in popul howev almost half of thi growth consist of migrat from the republ of the late soviet union primarili from russia the annual net immigr us to amount to 7 8000 peopl that wa hardli caus for rejoic we would have been happier with a lower level of popul growth with the chang in the polit situat popul growth began to slow in 1989 and to declin by 1992 with the restor of independ the pattern of migrat underw fundament chang greatli increas emigr consider exceed the declin rate of immigr and the net balanc becam neg some without bother to analyz who is go where draw the conclus that mani of us ar leav our homeland howev statist data show that the emigr consist primarili of russian belarusian and ukranian in 1992 the net balanc of migrat to the ex republ of the soviet union wa minu 21 100 peopl and in 1993 minu 12 000 we can take pleasur in the fact that repatri is take place peacefulli and uncoerc even a signific declin in popul due to thi reason is hardli caus for concern back to the subject thu far emigr to the countri of the west ha not been great in 1989 1993 the lithuanian popul declin by 5 600 due to migrat to the west thi constitut onli 12 percent of the total declin in the number of inhabit due to migrat jew constitut the primari migrant to western countri dure the last five year the lithuanian popul wa reduc by 900 due to migrat to the west howev it must be emphas that the offici statist ar incap at thi time of complet pin down the total emigr to the west it seem that we will have to determin later how mani did not return from short trip abroad anywai due to emigr to both east and west dure the last five year the popul of lithuania wa reduc by 51 800 peopl as a result from 1989 to 1993 the number of russian in lithuania declin by 33 600 that of ukranian by 7 400 that of the belarusian by 7 000 and that of the jew by 5 300 at the same time 5 400 more lithuanian immigr than emigr with the return home of the lithuanian who had for variou reason been scatter across the late soviet union their number ar grow the percentag of lithuanian in the gener popul is also grow thei constitut 79 6 percent in 1989 and 81 1 percent in 1994 sinc the number of inhabit and it growth ar not end in themselv the current observ declin in popul due to emigr cannot be view as a seriou demograph problem it especi should not be permit to overshadow those demograph problem that demand special attent and resolut action while natur increas ha thu far remain posit dure the last few year and especi in 1993 as the death rate rapidli increas and the birth rate decreas it approach that fate boundari at which fewer ar born than die dure the last coupl of decad natur increas account for an annual increas of 20 000 in the popul in 1993 it wa onli 600 in 1993 almost 7 000 fewer children were born and 4 600 more peopl di than in

a doubt 1993 will enter lithuanian demograph histori as a year of demograph declin lithuania ha never experienc such a sudden and spectacular decreas in the birth rate and increas in the death rate in a time of peac at least not in thi centuri it would be nice to believ that thi will be the last such record set howev it mai be that the near futur will bring even more impress achiev such demograph fluctuat ar usual the result of econom crise such crise affect the birth rate fairli quickli and notic the public reaction to a deterior standard of live and uncertain prospect first manifest itself

smaller such a great increas in an alreadi high by the standard of develop countri death rate betrai a public inabl to do anyth to save live the public health and death rate ar current affect by a number of new and to us unfamiliar factor we were taken unawar by the sudden chang in the condit and mode of life as well as by the chang in interperson relationship by unstabl employ and by a chang standard of live it is veri difficult especi for the older gener to adapt to new condit that increas stress and therebi affect the relat ill and death rate the death rate from circulatori and psychiatr ill is rapidli increas last year the death rate from circulatori diseas increas by 13 percent more and more often we ar lose middl ag and even young peopl to these diseas the death rate ha also increas due to reason directli link to a lack of normal live condit medic care and medicin in the period from 1990 to 1993 the death rate from infecti and parasit diseas increas by 45 percent death from tuberculosi almost doubl increas by 1 87 time and death from diabet diseas of the endocrin system and digest and metabol disord increas by 50 percent the death rate due to malign continu to

4 year thu we can onli sai that we have slip back by more than thirti year thi chang wa primarili the result of a greatli increas death rate among men especi in the countrysid the averag life expect of men declin in the period 1988 1993 by 4 6 year from 67 7 year in 1988 to 63 1 in 1993 and that of women by 1 7 year from 76 6 year to 74 9 year in 1993 the life expect of rural men wa 4 3 year shorter than it had been in 1959 have declin from 64 7 year to 60 4 year the differ between the life expect of men and women grew to nearli twelv year and in rural area up to 13 4 year a few year ago the averag male life span then shorter by nine year wa held up by foreign demograph as a characterist phenomenon of soviet mortal to what can we attribut the situat in 1993 some cold comfort can be taken from the fact that the declin of the averag life span coincid with a chang in the statist methodolog up until 1991 stillbirth were dealt with in accord with soviet methodolog which meant that mani infant that di soon after birth were not includ in the mortal statist howev that should have had more or less the same effect on the averag life expect of men and women it would be nice to believ that thi jump in the death rate is a temporari phenomenon the outcom of an accumul of caus the birth rate which had sharpli declin dure the first postwar decad then stabil itself and for twenti year remain at replac level i e the gener made wai for on anoth without an increas in the overal popul howev dure the last few year and especi in 1993 the birth rate fell to a level lower than had ever

past 14 year the nation s annual averag growth wa 7 4 percent surpass the 6 2 percent of econom effici by 1 2 percentag point second the improv in popul qualiti is slower than that in econom growth the improv in popul qualiti is the motiv forc for econom growth becaus train peopl requir a rel long time growth is rel slow the averag annual improv in the nation s popul qualiti wa 2 1 percentag point lower than econom effici if it is too low it indic that the two ar not coordin and that the increas in the number of technician cannot meet the need of econom growth third the increas in revenu is lower than econom growth view nationwid the growth in per capita revenu is slightli higher than that in per capita gdp nevertheless the factor of price increas is not deduct in revenu when it is done the growth in the former will be slower than that of the latter 2 never slacken effort to keep popul strictli under control becaus popul growth will directli hinder econom and social develop the natur growth rate over the past 14 year experienc a process of drop recoveri and drop again reach 11 6 per mill in 1992 a slight drop of 0 4 per mill from 1978 view from the net increas of popul over the past 14 year the countri had an increas of 209 million peopl 21 7 percent or an annual rise of 1 4 percent or 14 94 million peopl to further boost econom and social develop it is necessari to keep

same as those which attain the advanc social develop level in 1992 as the coastal area took bigger stride in reform and open up and maintain a high growth competit superior thei could get the upper hand in both develop level and growth becaus of their weak econom foundat prior to reform and their low base figur in 1978 yunnan henan guizhou guangxi anhui and other underdevelop region have develop rapidli sinc reform and open up their growth rate propel them into posit better than 16th place with yunnan rank 6th howev the 1992 social develop level of these region still lag behind 22d place liaon heilongjiang and jilin which had sharp contrast in their develop level and growth rank 4th 6th and 8th respect in their 1992 social develop level but their growth in the past 14 year wa 21st 28th and 25th respect the develop level of beij and tianjin were 1st and 3d but their growth rank 22d and 24th respect the main reason is that these municip had a sound foundat sinc reform howev there have been no major chang in the social set up or an increas in econom effici therefor their composit develop index were rel lower than other region it is noteworthi that the gap between the econom

1994 we dug about 4 000 km of aqueduct by the year 2000 we will have dug anoth 2 000 km these 4 000 km ar more than we have dug in the past 30 40 50 60 year the implement of thi program requir dig canal and aqueduct longer than the nile river and build on fourth as mani barrag as were built in egypt sinc the time of muhammad ali i onc visit a big countri where thei show me a bridg thei told me it is the longest bridg over a river in the world thei said it is 2 100 meter long i told them we have a 2 300 meter long bridg audienc laugh we actual have such a bridg in the north near disuq thei boast thei have a 2 000 meter long bridg i told them we have 2 200 and 2 300 meter long bridg we have mani bridg over the nile we have mani bridg and barrag on the nile but the peopl forget televis must enlighten the peopl on what is happen in their countri so that thei can be proud of their countri i am proud of my countri becaus i know what is be done everi citizen must know these thing so that he will be proud of hi countri these great effort have increas crop product which ha brought the product of egyptian soil near intern standard the product of sugar cane and rice ha increas in recent year the increas in product of these crop is the primari aim of the agricultur polici these crop ar the main food sourc and constitut a consider part of the product requir for sever of our factori we have increas hope that our agricultur export will increas brother i hear mani voic sai we can cultiv the desert and eat wheat but where would we get the water from thei sai we can achiev self suffici in wheat from the land cultiv at present at the expens of rice cotton etc i onc read in a newspap about some offici in on of the council ask why do we import fish when we have the mediterranean sea and the red sea our coast do not have fish why then do our fishermen from damietta and port said go to eritrea and yemen to fish we would not have to import fish if our sea were full of fish in the past we had a fleet that sail to morocco to fish but it oper at a loss i do not know where thei sold the fish audienc laugh we should realli understand ye we have a sea but we also have an econom market thi mean you don t bring in larg ship to fish when thei can t catch ani otherwis you will have to pai the fishermen s wage the ship will lose monei we will have to subsid them with tax monei and thei will onli bring you 200 or 300 kg of fish which if you can sell it will not cover even a small part of the expenditur we must understand well that we can never satisfi the demand by god we ar increas in number doe thi mean that we have to cultiv the desert everi time our popul increas where will i get water for thi all our water is enough for onli 2 or 2 5 million feddan at most and my god our popul increas by between 12 and 13 million everi year increas in egypt s crop product show how we can quickli reach the level of world product and even surpass them if the effort of farmer worker and the busi sector come togeth we ar proud of the farmer and the great work thei ar do for thi homeland thei must take better care of their crop and take into account the recommend of agricultur expert especi in the wake of the liber of crop price the scientist in egypt s univers institut and research center must work in the field in order to appli the achiev of the agricultur revolut which ha permit food self suffici in mani countri the busi sector whose role in and contribut to the nation economi is increas must invest more in the modern technolog and servic requir to rais the egyptian soil s product the great success in the field of agricultur expans and the obviou progress in the product cycl confirm the possibl of achiev similar success in diversifi our agricultur export which should be the second main object of our agricultur polici i have issu instruct that we should begin plan right now under the direct supervis of an apparatu that is free of red tape and bureaucraci to seek wai of exploit the new land in sinai so that thei reach half a million feddan after complet of the peac canal project the comprehens develop of the egyptian countrysid is the third object of our agricultur polici and thi mean focus on econom activ that ar connect to agricultur it is not reason or accept to let develop in egypt s countrysid be depend on the product of agricultur crop alon with half of egypt s manpow be emploi in thi sector in fact we have start experi in a number of villag in some governor and we will appli the result of these experi or amend them in the light of accumul experi so that develop will encompass the whole egyptian countrysid brother and sister our hope becom increasingli clear and bright when we review togeth the outcom of the huge effort undertaken in the field of industri you ar the hero and the vanguard of thi effort thi effort ha proceed in two parallel and complementari direct the first cours is the renov and modern of exist industri plant that ar suffer from wear and tear the second cours is the establish of new industri zone and equip with all need util and servic so that thei will be readi to receiv the biggest number of factori we have invest 34 billion pound in industri and mine over the past 11 year now we speak in term of billion wherea befor we spoke in term of million in the past the biggest power station cost 100 million pound now a power station such as shubra al khaymah cost 1 2 billion pound a million ha becom like a shill audienc laugh thei invent new name for a million instead of a rabbit and word indistinct audienc laugh we have invest 42 billion pound we have built new industri zone equip with servic and util so far we have built 13 industri new town and five new commun and we spent 3 3 billion pound on provid them with util by thi invest we have been abl to attract 3 044 project and factori in the town of 10 ramadan 6 octob al sadat citi burj al arab and other area the egyptian privat sector ha invest over 10 billion pound in these town provid job opportun for 170 000 egyptian when investor start a project and we give them tax break some peopl sai reduc their exempt our brother in the peopl s assembl sometim sai there is no need to provid tax exempt 10 year is too much i provid exempt to an investor to encourag him to emploi worker as far as i am concern it is better for him to emploi worker than to pai tax he will build hous what i will do with the tax monei i want more hous if he give us more i will treat him well he provid livelihood for the peopl and thi bring happi to the citizen thi is what we need emphasi on industri ha produc good result industri now constitut 42 percent of total nation invest it contribut to 28 percent of the local product and absorb 20 percent of the egyptian manpow expect to be emploi dure the year of the third five year plan thi success ha encourag us to establish new zone which ar be implement within the framework of the third five year plan all necessari fund have been earmark for establish 12 new town and industri zone if these town ar not establish and the hous and factori not built where will we be we will be in a mess the peopl will have no hous no job no livelihood all of us must calmli rememb what we have done where were we and where ar we now in the first year we gave prioriti to the more needi governor abov all the upper egypt governor we had faith in the need to intensifi effort in these area after we felt the increas desir of the citizen to invest in the first area alloc for thi purpos name the industri zone in suhaj to which 73 investor have appli in the past three month it is a new zone in suhaj we ar creat new area in upper egypt so our brother will invest there some peopl from upper egypt want to invest in cairo why don t you invest there no thei want to invest here near cairo peopl want to escap from thi cairo audienc laugh it is crowd we will find an agricultur project in aswan for them so 73 investor book plot of land in suhaj and began the measur to build their factori brother and sister our goal in the next few year is to make egypt a leader among nation receiv industri invest in the middl east the whole world is look for investor and i hope we will not drive them awai some peopl sai someon is drive a so and so car so what as long as he ha got a legitim busi you know how much duti he pai on hi car when he goe to clear hi car from custom financ minist al razzaz doe not spare him audienc laugh he ha to pai where doe the monei go thi make up our revenu i know that some peopl try to find a wai out some peopl try to bring in car on a trip ticket previou two word in english but we know how to deal with them peopl have told me about thi i also heard someth els which is veri strang and i told the financ minist about it a short while ago someon import equip the duti on which is 12 000 pound for instanc he leav the item in custom and tell them he doe not want it after a while it will have to be sold at auction in the meantim he make an arrang with some peopl to bui it at the auction if the duti on an item is 12 000 for instanc thei bui it for 2 000 then the origin buyer give these peopl anoth 2 000 for profit and bui the item for 4 000 which doe not cover the custom duti so you have to watch out for such trick audienc laugh someon told me about thi last night howev trick ar everywher i wa abroad and everywher i went i heard of similar trick all law can be circumv we ar human after all our goal in the next few year is to make egypt a leader among nation receiv industri invest in the middl east and to be a major center of export to all world market thi mean we must doubl our determin and effort in sever direct first to continu our drive to remov all obstacl face exist and new invest i have heard much from investor and i believ the govern is work on measur in the field of product necess and other relat to the gatt so that we can be competit we must develop our legisl and condit to cope with the world trend so that we could find new market in our trip abroad we try to find market everywher i go i try to find market henc the initi i announc at the peopl s assembl in novemb when i call for abolish all administr procedur for project with a capit that doe not exce five million pound so that all investor had to do wa to inform the compet author about their project the egyptian respons to thi step ha been excel dure the past four month alon 190 investor have appli for project to the tune of 410 million pound that will creat 13 000 job natur the peopl do not want to go through lengthi procedur whether in the electr sector invest author or whatev i try to attend meet of the invest committe to see what is happen in on such meet that i attend i found a project submit by two youngster for approxim 260 000 pound thei had been wait for eight month why so the idea cross my mind i said why don t we remov obstacl face investor with capit up to five million pound all thei need to do is find a plot of land in the new citi or in the desert not on agricultur land and then inform the author let them start and notifi the invest author which cannot veto them the invest author s job is to process the paper for them so that thei can qualifi for the exempt now that thi initi ha succeed i call on the govern to rais the ceil to 10 million pound applaus the same procedur will appli if you have a project to the tune of 10 million pound inform the invest author and start your project there ar mani place in upper egypt we have to make a breakthrough if we do not run we will be lost the peopl abroad ar run veri fast to see where their interest ar if we sit still and do noth it will not work second to complet as quickli as possibl establish and equip a third group of industri zone i believ that the govern ha taken measur to establish these zone in the area north of the gulf of suez port said damietta and west of alexandria on my visit to foreign countri i discuss thi issu with interest countri we have great hope but thi will take time we have been work on thi field sinc reconstruct minist al kafrawi ha held thi post he know the area north of the gulf of suez the problem is that we cooper with countri that ar beset by bureaucraci much more than we ar we ar establish industri zone in the area north of the gulf of suez port said damietta and west of alexandria we will also establish industri zone in upper egypt anyon can invest in the industri zone in kafr al shaykh or ani other area these industri zone ar not confin to al minufiyah al gharbiyah or ani other area anyon can establish project anywher and live in these area third we will initi a larg intern effort to make these area perman site for complet industri and stockpil product and distribut for intern trade i think i broach thi issu dure my visit to the prc we will try to benefit from world experi in establish modern center for market and train servic and introduc technolog into small project in egyptian citi and the countrysid our hope for a better futur do not stem from a void but from an object assess of the huge achiev that provid egypt with enorm product center that ar prepar to accommod thousand of new project i do not need to repeat the effort we have exert and the resourc we have alloc to rebuild the infrastructur which had deterior under increas burden i will not repeat the requir for new expans our goal of rebuild the basic util wa not confin to provid for the enorm hous need we focus as much attent on strengthen the industri sector capabl and provid it with electr transport and a sewag system i rememb that in 1983 or perhap late in 1982 i visit a factori i ask the manag what thei made he said the factori produc refriger and wash machin i notic that the worker were sit do noth i ask why and if the factori wa not oper thei told me that the power wa out and that the factori had electr power for onli two hour a dai i thought if it wa reason for a factori that had the capabl of produc 100 refriger a dai to have electr for onli two hour and produc onli 10 or 15 refriger i thought the worker would be psycholog frustrat becaus the more thei produc the more thei could get the factori wa lose and the worker were not to blame egypt at the time produc onli 18 billion kilowatt which wa insuffici now thank god egypt produc over 70 billion kilowatt had it not been for thi increas energi product we would not have had the new town industri progress or hous etc we focus thi much attent on bolster the industri sector capabl and provid the requir of electr energi transport transport and sewag network so that egyptian or foreign investor can establish plant or project that provid job to thousand of peopl who enter the work market everi dai in thi respect i think it is imper that i mention two problem that have exhaust the egyptian mind in the past decad in search of sound solut the first is the problem of popul growth which exce econom and social develop rate thi mai prove to be too difficult for our capabl to handl in the near futur if we do not watch out for the popul growth a time will come when we will be like some countri that cannot feed their peopl if the increas continu where will we get the subsidi from it will have to come through more tax we will not be abl to build road we will not be abl to creat job no matter what we do in the near futur if we do not take thi into consider and thi take year to pai off egypt will face danger mayb not in our lifetim but dure futur gener which we work for the issu of popul growth is veri seriou we will not be abl to find job place and a proper life for them we will be like some countri which i do not want to name where peopl live in the mountain with question food suppli someon from on countri told me that thei have approxim 100 million peopl live below the poverti line thei do not even give them bread or anyth thei leav them on their own to eat grass and i do not mean the other grass egyptian arab word for grass is hashish audienc laugh or anyth els natur thi also result in the problem of unemploy the second problem is unemploy which ha been on the rise in recent year although it root and caus go back to earlier administr dure which real product wa not the object of employ as far as the popul growth is concern the effort to which the entir peopl have contribut have made notic progress which all sign indic will be sustain for long year to come the increas in popul cannot be stop over night it take year for the rate to go down the growth in popul ha gone down to approxim 2 2 which point to a sensibl respons by egyptian famili to the call for plan our prophet ha said a strong believ is better and closer to god than a weak believ if i have a modest incom and a famili of 10 how can i feed them just have them around the hous will rais your blood pressur and you will die audienc laugh each on will ask for someth but if the famili is small no matter what headach thei mai caus you can handl it you will be abl to offer them a proper life educ them dress them well and give them medic treatment thi is becaus we do not know what the futur ha in stock for us i believ the futur gener will not go through the labyrinth we our father and grandfath had to go through the world ha shown an interest in the drop in the popul growth in egypt cairo ha been chosen to host on of the most import confer on popul in the 20th centuri under the auspic of the unit nation thousand of polit leader scientist and thinker will meet in egypt to exchang idea on popul issu the chines for instanc increas by 15 million everi year i laugh with them and told them why don t you take 30 million more from us and pretend that you increas by 30 million extra in two year audienc laugh we welcom thi confer and the arriv of the elit world leader thinker and expert but in the midst of thi success we must not forget that despit the drop in popul growth in the past few year the rate of popul growth in egypt is still higher than in mani countri that strive to improv the live standard of their peopl despit thi drop we expect from now until the year 2000 to increas by 12 million peopl of them more than 3 5 million youngster will join the labor market mai god help us find job for them we will have to find fruit job for them not to mention those who ar left behind without a job as a result of the popul increas in the past 10 year all thi caus us to intensifi govern and popular effort to sustain the success made in control the popul increas whether in hamlet villag or citi as for the problem of unemploy it exist all over the world and i am not defend it the unit state is run around try to open door for worker in franc which also suffer from a high unemploy rate the french foreign minist ha told the peopl don t expect me to solv thi problem quickli becaus it take year here some peopl think it can be solv overnight someon come out and call for unemploy benefit how can we tell who is work and who is unemploi mayb someon is work in the privat sector and is appli for work in the govern abroad thei have comput and know all the inform if someon submit an applic thei will check hi name on the comput is our system here computer no and to computer it we need monei mubarak is ask by someon in the audienc about law no 55 he repli no the govern is still work on it becaus it is a veri complic issu do you want to quit or what audienc laugh perhap the proper wai to address the problem of unemploy is that for the first time we have a detail chart that contain accur inform on the matter the comprehens survei conduct throughout all governor and villag show that the number of univers and school graduat who have appli for work in the past 10 year is 3 946 million peopl almost four million we have found job for approxim 2 5 million of them also 835 000 more job have been found for applic who do not hold univers or school degre thi show that despit the difficulti the egyptian economi ha manag to provid 3 4 million job in the past 10 year that is 341 000 number as heard job annual but we cannot go on like thi indefinit thei need industri land etc for how long can we keep up howev the popul increas ha forc on us a situat where a number of graduat remain unemploi thei number approxim 2 4 million and thei repres 9 2 of the egyptian work forc the unemploy rate is measur in comparison to the total work forc and thi is the wai it is everywher in the world i will read to you some figur about unemploy in the world and thei ar statist obtain from world magazin in other word we did not make them up to suit our purpos in spain the rate is 23 percent in franc it is 12 percent and these ar major industri nation in itali it is 11 7 percent in the uk it is approxim 10 percent in germani it is 9 1 percent in the netherland it is 4 2 percent in belgium it is 11 percent in denmark it is 11 percent in finland it is 12 5 percent and in ireland it is 20 percent thi is just to show you the rate around the world the rate in egypt is 9 2 percent of the work forc you ar not unawar of the strenuou effort undertaken by the state to cope with thi steadi increas in the number of citizen who join the work forc annual i repeat onc again that the effect wai to address thi situat is to increas the growth rate in gross domest product to be more than doubl the rate of popul growth thi alon can absorb the new work forc while at the same time lessen the number of the exist unemploi we will not manag to expand product unless we ar abl to sell our product in the world market thi is an import point if product increas but it cannot be sold nobodi will increas the product it will be wast thu we must find world market the world market have their own condit and i believ that the privat sector is more activ than the busi sector in thi regard and i hope the latter will catch up in the meantim the privat sector must be more activ and we ar help it we ar open door abroad and it ha to do the rest a businessman with a larg product onc came to me and ask that the govern market hi product abroad i told him that i would not pai him on fourth of the price of hi product audienc laugh how could the govern market hi product let it market it own product or not right atif sidqi audienc laugh we will not be abl to expand the product base until we ar abl to sell their product in world market thi make the expans of export a persist requir and a basic condit for progress in addit thi is consid an essenti requir for bridg the present gap in the balanc of payment and the trade balanc thi gap is caus by the fact that we import 11 billion worth of commod and our export exclud oil total approxim 1 5 billion we do not doubt that egypt s worker and produc will forg ahead to achiev thi strateg goal so as to fulfil the homeland s hope for egypt to take it fair share in intern trade the govern will support everi effort aim at promot export and will remov all administr obstacl befor export it remain for the produc and worker to make qualiti the focu of attent and activ let 1994 brother and sister be the year of qualiti and the good name of egyptian product a year in which we will all particip to achiev great stride in our export and to come close to a balanc between import and export achiev thi goal also requir us to go ahead with reform the mismanag compani now that we have drawn up a comprehens program that we hope to abl to implement in 1995 so that the worker of these compani will enjoi new circumst allow for increas product and higher wage the worker in ani success establish have a right to have higher wage that link wage and product the stanc of the worker establish on the reform program wa splendid and prove that egypt s worker ar the soldier of reform who have a real interest in promot the product establish and their capabl applaus brother and sister a seriou and frank confront of shortcom and the root of problem and a firm commit to the reform program will win egypt world respect and will give us increas confid in a brighter futur the concret indic of thi futur ar the fruit of reform that ar manifest to everyon we us to spend more than our annual incom and would pai the accumul and increas deficit by borrow insid and outsid egypt howev we have ration our expenditur develop our revenu sourc and have come veri close to strike a balanc between the state s revenu and expenditur certain circumst dictat that we impos new tax but we were care that most of the burden affect those who can afford to pai howev it wa inevit that part of thi burden would affect all segment of societi in order to curb inflat preserv the valu of the nation currenc and address the remain defect that hinder the nation economi i am not an economist but when inflat rise price will go up simpli speak when inflat beset a countri there will be more monei than product price will skyrocket to the point that no on can control the econom reform polici which econom expert and intern establish testifi ar be soundli implement have gener increas confid in our nation economi the budget deficit drop thi year to less than 3 percent but at on time it had risen to about 25 percent thi is the main problem in mani countri of the world inflat rate have drop to 8 percent and the save deposit have continu to increas free the exchang rate and lift restrict on foreign currenc have improv the invest atmospher and reassur export we have end the black market we also confront those us the peopl s livelihood to acquir huge profit by exploit the flow of subsidi we face the problem with courag we devot the entir subsidi to basic commod for the toil mass name bread sugar and edibl oil thi enabl us to guarante that thi subsidi would go to the right peopl howev there wa much fraud but i do not want to go into detail we elimin mani restrict that

brother and sister the sound start point in the social econom and even polit transform process dictat that we marshal our greatest energi to creat a radic chang in the educ philosophi commensur with develop need and societi s requir i believ that we ar pursu a sound path the egyptian citizen repres our most valuabl treasur the egyptian citizen is our hope and through thi citizen alon the process of progress is complet and egypt s aspir object ar achiev progress cannot be achiev without the promot of the egyptian citizen s energi and the transfer of the largest number of thi peopl into particip in increas and promot the qualiti of product thi is first among the mani huge task that we still have to perform the wai to attain thi task is to reconsid our concept of the educ and train institut which ar inde product establish that should be given prioriti in our invest program the develop world ha realiz that the potenti and talent of a product human be can be perceiv and nurtur from the first year of educ the school is now a center for receiv educ and the develop of skill prais be to god we realiz that the import of promot the qualiti of educ and it role in train and prepar skill will alwai enabl the citizen to have the appropri job opportun thi could never have been done without an overal nation program to modern our school and promot their syllabus we must focu on the substanc and qualiti and not on quantiti dure the school year to enabl our son to carri out school activ that would develop their skill the implement of thi program start last year when with the

object of educ last year alon 1 500 school were built and 7 800 other were renov all thi cost us 1 3 billion pound thi is where monei is spent step ar under wai to build 1 500 school thi year at a time when the invest expenditur were doubl over the past two year the expenditur ar four time those incur in 1992 nevertheless there still ar mani thing to be achiev becaus the program to modern the egyptian school need ten of billion of pound it is worth note that the plan to develop and modern technic educ and vocat train adopt the two side educ system appli in mani advanc countri thi system is base on combin educ and train in the institut becaus train is the basic factor in creat skill labor peopl who can deal with complic technic problem and increas the qualiti of product our new industri facil in madinat al ashir min ramadan madinat sittah uktubar al sadat burj al arab and other area will pioneer thi new educ trend thi should get us off to a good start in the 21st centuri where factori blend with school laboratori with librari and product and industri with scienc and innov and where qualiti is base on research and creativ the second task face us is that of find a comprehens solut to the problem of egyptian citizen live in randomli built slum area the randomli built area ar scar on egypt s face the level of public servic avail in these area is much lower than anyth we consid accept for a dear section of the egyptian peopl as you mai know i have instruct the compet author to prepar a two part comprehens plan to face thi problem the first part alreadi under wai deal with the problem of exist randomli built area mani of which go back to the thirti in thi centuri when we look close into the randomli built area we discov that some go back to the year 1924 the first shantytown sprang up in 1924 by the sixti the phenomenon had mushroom and in the seventi and eighti it got even wors in al jizah there is a place call izbat al sa aydah that goe back to 1924 saqiyat makki date back to 1960 and al munib to 1970 in cairo izbat abu ard goe back to 1955 arab ghunaym and arab wadi to 1960 manshiyat nasir to 1962 and izbat al hajjanah to 1965 in alexandria izbat al sayd goe back to 1960 all these ar randomli built area that came into be over the year i would like to tell you thi when we began the first develop plan we were not abl to take care of everi problem in the countri we had to make prioriti the monei we had at our dispos wa limit we spend it accord to prioriti updat the infrastructur build hous and so on and so forth now it is time to address the problem of randomli built area do you know how much these randomli built area will cost us we have spent 581 million pound so far in order to rehabilit these area in 11 governor we will need seven billion pound shall we cut back all other program to focu on thi problem by the time we get to the other governor the sum total of expenditur on randomli built area will reach 17 billion we ar awar of the size of the problem and within our resourc will do everyth possibl to resolv it i want everi citizen to live in digniti in the first part of the aforesaid plan we will spend 600 million pound in urban renov program of which the southern governor will receiv about 300 million pound the second part of the plan aim at prevent the emerg of such area in the futur through the build of plan area in all governor on a scale suffici to absorb the increas in urban popul thi effort will fall within the third develop plan a third task face us is that of protect low incom household in order to achiev social justic the countri will continu to offer equal opportun in educ and to provid free educ in all state run school the state is also commit to provid health care to the needi in it hospit and clinic over the next few year we will redoubl our effort to improv the qualiti of health care provid in state run hospit and clinic the state also take it upon itself to subsid bread even if it cost goe up we ar now spend 1 542 billion on bread subsidi and will maintain these subsidi on principl even though we ar awar of the rise cost involv due to increas wheat price and the higher demand associ with the growth in popul the state is provid thi subsidi becaus it believ that the poor should be abl to bui bread at a price that suit their incom the state s guarante is confirm and is continu in all these field howev the real guarante for those who ar not abl to help themselv is achiev by help them becom abl to help themselv therefor as of next year we will alloc more financi resourc for the social fund for the product famili project and for the project of support craftsmen and owner of small workshop to help these group rais their incom the fourth mission is the comprehens and continu modern of the product of commod and servic thi is on of the most import challeng that we must meet as soon as possibl thi will enabl egyptian produc to dedic their effort to develop egyptian commod in form and substanc the fifth mission is the develop of the egyptian administr system so that it will be abl to effect the desir chang aim at increas the egyptian societi s capac for product and export we must search for qualifi peopl and select those capabl of turn loss into profit and failur into success in our establish we must train these personnel on the most modern method of administr thi must take place under the supervis and auspic of effici trainer capabl of effect thi chang in the egyptian administr system brother and sister we ar dedic all our effort and work for the sake of god and the homeland in all our step we adher to the basic interest of the peopl we make sacrific to make them happi and we work hard to make them secur an examin of our activ abroad will reveal to those who wish to know that the main aim of thi activ is to serv the domest front provid the proper climat for the promot of the nation interest secur the egyptian peopl s right to develop their resourc achiev the maximum employ of their creativ capabl and arriv at a better life thi wa our pledg and commit when we extend the bridg of friendship and understand to the variou peopl of the world in the east and west and in the north and south thi wa our wish and desir when we exploit these relat to find work opportun for egyptian worker abroad and to open new market for egyptian commod and servic we succeed in cancel half of our debt which accumul while were build our infrastructur from a near zero point thi will remain our pledg and commit as we step into the 21st centuri and particip with other state in establish a new world order the emphasi of big and small state alik is gener turn from polit and militari affair to econom issu and concern in thi connect we note two import phenomena that requir us to open our mind and devot our think to the altern avail to us to deal with them and with their effect on our nation interest the first phenomenon is repres by the rapid chang that have occur recent in the field of intern trade mani peopl ask what thi gatt is i believ the economi minist can explain thi issu on televis the recent round of uruguai multilater talk result in the sign of an import agreement which will result in draw up the cours of trade exchang among world state for the come decad thi agreement wa approv in marrakesh on 15 april the second phenomenon is the tendenc of mani state in the variou contin to establish huge econom bloc that will make it difficult for small and isol entiti to run their econom and trade relat effici and effect unless thei take the necessari measur to deal with thi new situat in view of the polit and technic complic surround these two phenomena we must not hesit to assess them and to draft the polici we will follow in confront their effect on us and the fratern countri with whom we share uniti of interest and fate particularli the arab fratern countri and the african countri therefor i decid to make these two topic an object of meticul and in depth studi that doe not focu on theoret issu but on aspect that ar us in chart polici and adopt the stand that ar effect in protect our pan arab interest sinc these two issu should be submit to the variou offici and popular group and institut for gener discuss i believ that the labor feder must effect particip in thi work applaus becaus it would not be fair for such issu to be decid far from the concept and principl of the labor base move on to the middl east peac process we find that posit sign give rise to hope that 1994 will be the year in which we find a comprehens and last peac on everi track start with the palestinian track on which the two side made great stride by sign the oslo washington and cairo agreement and agre on most detail for set up the palestinian self rule author to replac the isra militari govern and it civil administr the month of mai must wit the faith and strict implement of these agreement so as to enhanc the peac process and deepen the concern peopl confid in the inevit of the victori of peac and the influenc of stabil and secur against the tendenc toward violenc reject and impot brother and sister our high hope for a brighter futur ar base on firm foundat and ration object consider thi is becaus thei reli on clear cut reason and hard work that ha enabl egypt regain it pioneer role in make progress had it not been for the correct effort along the econom and polit track we would have never been abl to bridg the huge transform process with the outstand success that chang the face of life in egypt our clear concept promot our

the work of famili plan in most of the area in china and help some cadr chang their passiv attitud and overcom their fear of difficulti in promot famili plan after the conclus of the symposium on the southern jiangsu model theoretician on popul and worker for famili plan have promptli studi the work for the control of popul growth in econom underdevelop area in their studi the theoretician have discov that chengd is a fairli typic hilli old minor and poverti stricken district after explor variou wai and carri out variou experi over a protract period of time thei have develop a manag mechan which conform with the local econom and cultur situat and found the road to success in famili plan by us on the spot inspect tour the leadership of the state famili plan commiss and scholar on popul growth highli prais chengd s experi in control popul growth thei regard chengd as a typic exampl of an underdevelop district in successfulli control popul growth to studi chengd s experi in control popul growth will be of great signific in promot famili plan in most of the area in china passag omit 2 theoret background in develop chengd model of famili plan western expert in demograph econom believ that econom develop plai a signific role in promot popul growth when the per capita incom is below us 300 both econom develop and popul growth ar full of vital when the per capita incom is between us 300 and us 700 econom develop notabl restrain popul growth onli when the per capita incom reach us 700 chines scholar on popul also believ that in china a turn point in popul growth will appear onli when the per capita incom reach 1 500 to 2 000 yuan the practic of famili plan in chengd challeng thi kind of theori in an area where the economi is not well develop chengd tri to control popul growth while develop it economi it ha realiz it goal in place it popul under effect control while rapidli develop it economi chengd s experi onc again tell us that in a nation where the economi is not well develop and the pressur from popul is extrem high we can no longer sit tight to wait for our social and econom condit to chang ani more china s state of affair show that on the on hand we must regard econom construct as the central task vigor develop the product forc in societi and strive to creat condit for china s four modern program and check popul growth while on the other hand we must unswervingli implement the basic state polici on famili plan adopt strong measur to effect control popul growth and creat a fine environ in term of popul for the develop of our economi 3 comparison between chengd model and southern jiangsu model china s uneven econom develop lead to the uneven develop of the famili plan program and the us of differ form in popul control there ar alreadi sever model for popul control in china the southern jiangsu model is a typic exampl of popul control in an econom develop area while the chengd model is on which prevail in an econom underdevelop area the souther jiangsu model of popul control is a mechan aim at divert the pressur exert on the societi by popul such as employ social distribut social secur social welfar and other social benefit to each famili to restrain famili growth econom develop and variou mechan of restraint includ the mechan with the benefit as the guid factor help peopl chang their concept on childbirth and achiev the goal of control popul growth the chengd model of popul control is aim at foster a manag mechan which conform with the local econom and cultur condit and follow the path of control popul growth and develop the economi simultan in an underdevelop area the effect control of the popul promot econom develop while the rapid econom develop help peopl chang their concept on childbirth 4

level the macro structur level the mesostructur level and the micro structur level 1 from the macro structur point of view thi model is an oper mechan for popul and economi the lower of the rate of popul growth will certainli promot social and econom develop becaus fund for rais children can be save and invest in improv the qualiti of life and develop the economi and in promot educ develop and econom construct educ develop and the chang in the concept and behavior on childbirth also bring about social progress on the other hand econom educ and social develop also creat materi condit for

effect of chengd popul control the assess of ani model of popul control should be made on the basi of the popul effect the econom effect and the social effect chengd ha achiev remark effect in all

1991 rank top among the eight prefectur in the provinc 3 social effect the develop of famili plan bring about profound chang in peopl s knowledg on childbirth and in their concept of valu on children and their oblig in societi peopl now prefer late marriag late childbirth and less children rather than earli marriag earli childbirth and more children thei prefer a new form of life over the rural or retir life the young peopl take care of their children while old peopl ar also well taken care of accord to a survei conduct by du peng and other from the peopl s univers of china 16 3 percent of the peopl in chengd prefectur regard a singl child as adequ 68 7 percent of them regard two children as adequ while onli 12 8 percent of them prefer three or more children thi indic that notabl chang have taken place in peopl s concept on childbirth 7 develop trend in chengd model of popul control if we analyz the basic trend in popul growth we realiz that chang of the product of human be gener have to go through the follow sever stage the stage of us control as the lead factor the stage of mix restraint and the stage of us econom and social condit to spontan check popul growth the stage of us control as the lead factor mean that variou mean and wai of control ar mainli us to check popul growth in the area where the economi is not well develop thi is the origin pattern to bring about popul chang in an econom backward area where the popul growth is excess rapid thi pattern is adopt becaus the local economi is backward and there is no econom foundat to spontan reduc the popul growth rate the backward economi mai even serv to increas the popul the chengd model of popul control belong to thi type the model of mix restraint us both econom and control factor in control popul growth the characterist of thi model is that although the factor of econom condit to spontan control popul growth is grow there ar still no social and econom condit to spontan lower the popul growth rate it is necessari to us mean of control to check popul growth the southern jiangsu model belong to thi type the model of us econom and social condit to spontan check popul growth mainli appear in econom develop countri or district when social product enter the stage of industri the modern of scienc and educ educ and cultur and the rais of live standard serv to chang peopl s idea and concept on valu and on childbirth and help peopl realiz the modern goal of maintain low birth and death rate and low popul growth at the symposium mani comrad freeli express their own view on the chengd model of popul control some of the comrad believ that chengd ha achiev a great deal in popul control todai in addit to the fact that the lead comrad at all level have attach import to and truli work hard for popul control and persist grasp the two type of product simultan chengd s success is also close connect with the compet basic level organ and their effort in give public and educ in energet serv the mass and in manag their affair with a scientif approach it is also becaus the polici on childbirth is quit close to that of the mass and the peopl s custom and work style ar good in light of the actual difficulti in carri out product and live in hilli district and on the river embank the hebei provinci regul on famili plan stipul that the mass live in hebei s hilli district and river embank area mai have second child four year after their first on thi polici is quit close to the peopl s aspir on childbirth work on famili plan in thi connect can be carri out more easili some comrad also said that chengd s experi in control popul growth is good howev it is noth uniqu it is a combin of the experi in variou local therefor it cannot be call a model it should be call chengd experi other also point out that the low birth and death rate and low popul growth rate of chengd s popul ar unstabl the popul will bounc back onc the administr restrain were loosen moreov problem such as the low qualiti of life high rate of birth defect and high sex ratio of babi also exist the chengd model of popul control still fail to bring about a modern popul chang it is too earli to call it a model in deal with these argument li honggui head of the gener offic of the state famili plan commiss point out at the symposium that it is a misunderstand to regard everyth as good whenev a model is mention a model is not someth rigid and unchang there is still room for develop and improv yang kuifu vice chairman of the state famili plan commiss said that there ar differ opinion on whether it should be

the southern jiangsu model wa a term in connect with the econom model of southern jiangsu actual it can be call southern jiangsu experi if southern jiangsu can be call a model so can chengd as for

the popul clock ha sprung on us the surpris that egypt s popul ha reach 60 283 million peopl compar to 58 million last year what about the popul minist s statement that we have been abl to control the popul explos and that there is evid respons from citizen to famili plan will our media continu to confront thi popul catastroph with televis and newspap advertis can thi danger figur motiv the govern to adopt firm decis to deal with thi problem that ha becom a matter of life or death for egypt s futur develop when will famili plan becom a nation issu and when will all faction be call upon to contribut to solv it numer question and inquiri that abound with anxieti and that ar reiter on the egyptian scene gather in my mind while i wa on my wai to interview dr mahir mahran the popul and famili affair minist who said promptli the declar figur is incorrect and it doesn t reflect the true number of egypt s popul there is an actual respons to famili plan and the number of women us contracept ha amount to 50 percent the minist ad we cannot do more than thi or issu firm decis similar to those issu by china becaus of our social circumst therefor we reli on persuas and leav the choic up to the citizen it wa natur for me to begin the dialogu with dr mahir mahran the popul and famili affair minist by ask him for an explan on the report circul by all the media sai that the popul of the arab republ of egypt ha amount to 60 283 million peopl compar to 58 million last year explain dr mahir mahran respond thi figur is incorrect becaus it doesn t reflect the true number of the popul of the arab republ of egypt when we speak of egypt s popul we shouldn t includ citizen who resid in libya and kuwait and emigr to canada and australia becaus we aren t respons for educ feed or treat them so the actual number of egypt s popul is 57 673 million peopl thi is the number with which govern offici deal when thei consid the provis of hous food school and hospit thi certainli isn t in conflict with our moral respons for expatri egyptian the popul affair minist ad the danger of the popul problem li in the fact that there is dispar between popul growth and avail resourc expatri egyptian aren t includ in these calcul we have exceed target figur al husayni far from the censu figur and from how correct thei ar you have announc that the popul explos process ha been brought under control and that the citizen have respond to famili plan if thi ha actual happen then why haven t it effect shown clearli in the popul survei mahran what i have announc is complet true the proof is that the normal popul growth rate wa 30 per 1 000 or 3 percent thi rate drop to 22 per 1 000 or 2 2 percent in 1992 moreov we have recent receiv indic confirm that normal popul growth ha drop to less than 20 per 1 000 or 2 percent thi is undoubtedli great especi if we consid the recommend of the nation popul confer that wa attend by presid husni mubarak in 1984 if we review those resolut we find that thei hope that contracept us among women would amount to 36 percent by 1991 and to 43 percent by 1996 but what ha happen and thi is confirm by statist is that contracept us among women of child bear ag amount to 47 6 percent or close to 48 percent in 1990 thi mean that in 1990 we were abl to surpass the figur target for 1996 thi percentag is signific becaus it undoubtedli reflect on the number of birth consequ statist indic that from 1991 to 1992 the number of birth drop by 100 000 al husayni mr minist thi 100 000 figur is veri small and it doesn t signifi the evid respons about which you have talk mahran when deal with thi issu we must take into account that egypt s illiteraci rate amount to 46 percent now as shown by the popul plan prepar under the supervis of 80 expert and professor repres the ministri concern univers research center and privat organ despit thi high illiteraci rate we find that there is respons among women of child bear ag to the us of contracept especi in upper egypt the proof of thi is that the popul and health survei conduct everi four year ha confirm that in some governor especi in upper egypt contracept us among women increas by 100 percent from 1988 to 1992 al husayni but statist also confirm that egypt s popul ha been increas by 1 2 million annual for sever year so why doesn t the effect of increas contracept us show in popul figur mahran popul growth is a must it exist and it will continu to exist for the next 20 25 year becaus egypt ha now a broad segment amount to nearli 45 percent the popul ag below 20 thi segment will have it turn to marri and to think of famili and of produc children thi is normal and expect continu increas al husayni thi is a foregon conclus but in light of the effort you have talk about it is possibl to reduc the increas to just 1 million instead of 1 2 million mahran thi is actual what ha been happen popul growth rose to 1 4 million annual and then drop to 1 2 million we should note that even though egypt s popul is grow steadili we have maintain thi rate of 1 2 million for sever year thi is a good sign if the respons i am talk about wasn t there thi 1 2 million figur would have increas year after year televis advertis aren t enough al husayni mr minist mani believ that at a nation popul center and then at the popul affair ministri you have reli fundament for famili plan on televis and newspap advertis you spend on thi advertis million of pound that you get either from foreign organ or from the state budget but thi isn t enough to confront egypt s popul growth problem now that it ha becom so seriou mahran to begin the phase of strong emphasi on the media ha been essenti for enlighten if you ar talk about the futil of televis advertis campaign for the educ then thi is true but the educ account for no more than 20 percent of the egyptian peopl and most of them do their own famili plan without the need for ani other parti but the rest of the egyptian peopl especi the egyptian rural popul and those who live in poor quarter and who constitut the overwhelm major of egypt s popul thei ar greatli influenc by televis and it ha produc obviou result among them for exampl televis ha dissemin inform benefici to the servic recipi whether the inform is about find the place where the servic is render or about variou type of contracept and about how to get them thi ha led to an increas number of women who frequent famili plan clinic therefor the mean of televis advertis is within the bound of our resourc and circumst an effect mean especi sinc we ar talk about a countri where the illiteraci rate amount to 46 percent china s experi al husayni other countri such as china have emploi swift mean to solv thi problem by issu firm requir that citizen observ and appli or els be expos to neg incent consequ these countri have been actual abl to deal with thi problem within a few year mahran the egyptian citizen will not accept the mean us by china especi sinc china ha emploi just two specif mean name compulsori abort and steril these mean ar prohibit by law except in a few case such as when the mother s health is in danger moreov china ha determin that urban famili will have on child and rural famili two if a citizen fail to observ thi limit he is subject to neg incent but we cannot emploi thi method in egypt the citizen will reject it and some clergymen will object to it moreov egypt s leader believ that it isn t appropri to forc citizen to implement someth through pressur and punish especi under the difficult econom circumst that egypt is experienc current and that caus hardship to mani citizen al husayni mr minist the direct caus of the econom and social crisi experienc current by egypt is the fear annual popul growth if the problem of popul inflat isn t dealt with pressur and hardship will increas year after year mahran thi is true but even if the govern agre to establish famili plan control and to compel citizen to appli them we will be surpris by a revolut by clergymen perhap even befor citizen object we will begin hear phrase such as each infant come with hi livelihood and you ar interf in god s will therefor the mean we have us so far is the mean of persuad peopl of voluntari famili plan with gentl word and without the us of coercion or pressur al husayni will you continu to us gentl and voluntari mean even if thei fail to produc the desir result thu make the popul problem more seriou and complex mahran we ar proceed along the right path but not with the requir speed thi saddl the govern with some econom burden howev the govern accept thi burden so the citizen will not experi more pressur we don t wish to speak pessimist about thi issu especi sinc there is respons to famili plan even though it isn t as quick as on desir but it suffic that we have gotten to the point where on of everi two women us contracept nation issu al husayni mr minist mani demand that we establish the popul growth issu as a nation issu to which all faction contribut their idea and effort especi sinc thi issu ha becom a matter of life or death to egypt s futur develop mahran everybodi will particip and cooper with us when he is convinc of the need for famili plan thi is what we ar try to accomplish now as a first step al husayni to deal with thi problem we can make our nation issu for the come phase the issu of appli the law that prohibit truanci at the basic educ level and that call for punish truant children i believ that appli thi law is enough to deal with a major part of the problem mahran how al husayni most urban famili ar content with on or two children becaus to these famili a child is a financi burden when it come to school food and cloth but most famili who produc a larg number of children view a child as a sourc of incom consid that such a child leav school goe into the labor market and start earn a monthli incom of 100 pound or more while still in hi tender year thi is why a child is a sourc of wealth for such famili and why thei cannot respond to or be persuad by the principl of famili plan which will depriv them of thi incom thi is the class of peopl who produc 10 or more children and who creat the popul crisi we ar all experienc now therefor if the law prohibit school truanci is appli if a fine is levi on a truant child and if the famili begin to shoulder the expens of feed cloth and educ the child it will think a thousand time befor it produc thi immens number of children mahran we have no object to adopt ani measur as long as it is in societi s interest but thi must be done in light of conclus reach by studi on thi issu howev we ar current conduct field studi in cooper with egyptian research center we await the outcom of these studi on the rural famili s size on labor among children and on school truanci number we can then make the right decis on thi issu in light of the conclus made by these studi lower servic standard al husayni so in addit to advertis in the variou media what is the ministri s plan to tackl thi problem in the come phase especi sinc on of the import reason for creat thi ministri is to confront egypt s popul growth problem mahran to start bare three month have pass sinc the ministri wa creat moreov we ar deal with all element of the popul issu not just with famili plan there is no doubt that famili plan is an import element on which we focu in our effort to solv the popul growth problem but the popul problem ha three main dimens the first dimens is increas popul growth we try to curtail thi problem through famili plan activ design to curb the rush to produc children the second dimens is the poor distribut of egypt s popul for exampl 99 percent of the popul live on a narrow strip along the nile if we redistribut the popul we will elimin numer problem we will reduc popul densiti haphazard hous terror and crime we have actual begun to work to achiev thi end if we look at egypt s map we will find that effort have been made by the govern to redistribut the popul for exampl numer new town and villag have been built in the red sea governor and citizen have begun to move there inhabit and develop them moreov a number of villag have appear along the northern coastal highwai all the wai to marsa matruh governor thi is in addit to new town in upper egypt where we find for exampl al minya and al minya al jadidah new al minya asyut and asyut al jadidah plu the town creat in recent year such as al ubur al sadat 10 ramadan 6 octob and other town all these town have been built to redistribut the popul but to accomplish thi goal greater awar is need among the popul so peopl will move and resid in these new town especi if work opportun and hous and residenti resourc ar secur for them the third dimens is the so call low standard of servic here it is requir to enhanc the standard of servic provid to the popul what i mean is that in the area of educ the number of the educ should be increas in the area of health mortal rate among infant and pregnant mother should be reduc for exampl the mortal rate among pregnant women is 174 per 100 000 thi is a veri high rate when compar with the advanc countri where the mortal rate among pregnant women is 5 11 per 100 000 pregnanc the more we enhanc the popul characterist the greater popul awar grow thu we can develop the idea of what the appropri famili size is make thi size compat with the famili s materi and social capabl which is what is happen in the west the famili plan servic plan of the ministri of popul and famili affair focus on spread health servic to villag especi sinc on half egypt s villag total 4 200 in number ar depriv of famili plan servic the plan also focus on greater us of the media in all it form on manufactur contracept local under all circumst regardless of the natur of our relat with the countri from which we acquir these contracept and on provid the servic perman the plan call moreov for secur a rural femal advisor for everi 5 000 famili current on advisor is alloc for everi 30 000 famili consequ she cannot perform her duti at all the plan also call that greater attent be given to the issu by local govern and that famili plan committe be form that ar head by villag chief thi is what we have actual begun to do in a number of villag especi sinc a villag chief ha strong relat with hi villag inhabit ordinarili and sinc he can influenc and persuad them the plan further call for increas the number of mobil medic unit especi sinc there ar villag that ar so remot from famili plan center and unit that the clinic and unit

plummet mr horst hall head of the matern depart at the charit east berlin s largest hospit first notic the trend in earli 1990 you just had to look at the statist he explain befor 1989 there were about 16 000 babi born each year in east berlin todai that figur ha slump to 6 800 a declin of about 60 per cent in the charit itself we us to record about 2 200 birth a year todai we have fewer than 1 800 and we ar do better than most matern hospit in east berlin such an unpreced fall in the birth rate would have shock the former communist regim in east germani it pride itself on it wide rang of social servic aim at provid women with excel childcar facil to encourag them to have children then dai care centr were free women could take a year s paid matern leav and return to a guarante job or take off three year with gener state support and still have the same job to go back to inde more than 90 per cent of the femal work popul were emploi compar with 49 per cent in west germani by the ag of 21 east german women start have children unlik their west german counterpart who gener start a famili in their mid to late 20s despit these incent howev the birth rate in east germani wa rel low compar with most other east european countri under the communist mr jurgen dorbritz a demograph at the feder statist offic sai what we ar now see in eastern germani is a birth rate which is fall from a low base that is the worri aspect that s what make the statist so extraordinari in 1989 there were 198 922 live birth in east germani the equival of 12 birth per 1 000 or about 1 6 children per famili thi wa the same as in west germani by 1993 the number of east german birth had fallen to 79 926 or about 60 per cent of the 1989 rate the equival of 0 8 children per famili or onli half the west german level we just don t know how long thi trend will continu on thing is certain there will be veri few children born between the year 2015 and 2020 becaus of the lack of women of child bear ag can you imagin how difficult it is go to be to pai for the number of old peopl in our countri said mr dorbritz accord to the latest statist from the german associ for pension insur the number of peopl under the ag of 20 in east germani will fall from 3 84m in 1993 to 2 6m in 2020 the number of peopl ag between 20 and 60 will fall from 8 7m to 7 6m and those over 60 will rise from 3m to 4 13m the percentag of pension per 100 contributor to the state pension insur system will rise from 26 per cent in 1993 to more than 50 per cent by 2020 mr hall who ha work in the charit for 28 year believ there ar sever reason why east german women ar remain childless demograph tend to ignor the fact that we had been expect a sharp fall in the birth rate in the year 1995 regardless of unif thi is becaus the east german abort law of 1972 made abort avail on demand we knew we were not go to have mani child bear women in the mid 1990s he explain in 1972 the birth rate fell to about 6 per 1 000 climb back to about 12 birth per 1 000 todai it is fewer than 5 1 but mr hall also believ that the process of german unif itself ha had a profound social effect on east german women a young east german woman know that if she becom pregnant the chanc she will find a job ar now far less especi given the high level of unemploy he said east german women have born the brunt of unemploy which is offici 16 per cent of the work popul exclud those on short time work earli retir scheme or job creation programm by the end of the first quarter of thi year more than 790 000 east german women had lost their job repres a femal unemploy rate of 23 per cent in west germani 1 1m women or 9 3 per cent ar out of work east german women todai have freedom of choic but thei have lost their statu in societi said mr dorbritz the other pressur aris from unif is that mani east german women have had to seek new qualif retrain or chang job more often unlik the former dai when a job wa for life there is no more secur the widespread sens of uncertainti ha plai a major role in the declin of the birth rate said mr dorbritz the freedom to travel ha plai it part in the declin of the birth rate as well young east german women have an unpreced chanc to go abroad befor thei settl and start a famili there wa hardli anyth els to do befor 1989 said mr dorbritz east german societi wa gear toward encourag young women to procreat all those social plank of free kindergarten both parent in a job heavili subsidis or free children s cloth and shoe have now disappear greater mobil and open border have led to a sharp rise in migrat from east germani to west germani more than 1 2m from a popul of 17m east german went to live in west germani between late 1989 and earli 1991 mani of these peopl were young and skill said mr nichola eberstadt a demograph at the american enterpris institut for public polici research of the overal drop in the birth rate roughli on ninth can be attribut to the sheer declin of east germani s popul dure those two year staff at the charit hospit know that unless the birth rate increas the obstetrician doctor and nurs could be without a job we have 2 000 bed here said mr hall befor unif we were deal with more than 2 200 women a year if we cannot account for all the bed we will be under pressur to make save that mean cut job but hi main concern is the kind of societi which will evolv in east germani in the next centuri the prognosi is veri bad said mr hall i do not know how we ar go to fend for the elderli who is go to pai for them on answer might be to allow immigr into the countri under a quota system to replenish the popul a solut advanc by some liber on thing is clear mr eberstadt believ that if the present trend in east germani continu it will be virtual
