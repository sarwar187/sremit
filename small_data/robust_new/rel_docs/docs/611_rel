how will you go about win the bundestag elect kohl i do not know why heiner geissler feel sick as former secretari gener he should know that poll and elect result ar two complet differ thing we ar enter the so call marathon elect year it will be a veri difficult year there will be a number of municip and diet elect as well as the european and the bundestag elect i am convinc that we will win the bundestag elect all the sign i see indic that why should i discuss todai s poll if the elect result fuch word indistinct kohl let me give you an exampl on cannot ignor the fact that the economi is slowli recov it is obviou that export ar rise industri nation worldwid ar get out of the trough the recess due to german uniti we enter the recess two year later and we will also get to leav it later but the figur ar clear it will not be a super upward movement but the mood in industri is just like spring natur is wake up there is an upward trend thi appli to western germani and to a much greater extent to eastern germani gottlieb at the cdu parti confer you said clearli that a grand coalit is out of the question for you you state just as clearli that a coalit with the free democrat parti fdp continu to be desir not out of love but out of reason now the fdp is quit weak at the moment it stand at about 5 percent and thei ar duli avoid make a clear coalit statement when will you tell mr kinkel to make up hi mind kohl first i think that it is a preelect tradit to downgrad the fdp we want to i want to continu the coalit with the fdp mainli becaus we work togeth veri well and becaus i do not see an altern a social democrat parti of germani spd green coalit would certainli lead the countri into isol gottlieb but mr kinkel doe not make a statement kohl second i have no doubt that the fdp will make a statement gottlieb when kohl thei will certainli do thi in due cours there is no hurri the fdp is much too clever to ignor the fact that you cannot work well for four year sai in the elect campaign we have work well for four year and then not take a clear posit thi mean we have european elect in a few week time in june and there ar municip and diet elect it is clear that the fdp will sai what it ha to sai befor that i do not have a problem and i have a lot of patienc the fdp know what is good for it and everyth els is certainli bad for it i am warn against a prematur conclus as we have often had it in the past the fdp now hold at 5 percent it will probabl not make it thi wa a popular thing when genscher wa chairman first the situat wa depict as unfavor and then there ar a lot of peopl who sai we want the fdp all the same i do not doubt that the fdp will get over the 5 percent hurdl it will achiev a better result fuch mr chancellor you have had a strong partner in the south the bavarian csu now the csu ha been make neg headlin for week how will you make it in bonn if the csu doe not make a major contribut kohl it is no coincid that what is go on in bavaria is happen a few week befor the elect i would like to take thi opportun to sai a few clear word on the attack that ar now be made on late csu chairman franz josef strauss franz josef strauss is on of the great architect of the frg he achiev great thing for germani and for bavaria todai s bavaria is hi achiev to a great extent i can sai thi without reserv becaus i am on of those who had a lot of conflict with him when he wa still aliv thi is the first thing i would like to sai about thi the second thing is that i trust that my friend in the csu will do what is necessari to explain the recent incid accus have been made by peopl who ar in veri ambigu posit themselv thi must be explain but the csu achiev the achiev of franz josef strauss ar undisput and i think we will be abl to express thi clearli to bavarian voter gottlieb let me come back to anoth point mr chancellor it is undisput that the liber ar get weaker right now thi mai chang again and the green have becom stronger at the moment a lot point toward an spd green coalit such an allianc is no longer fear by the peopl thei have becom respect should helmut kohl not be afraid of such a coalit kohl how do you know that spd green would be accept by the peopl in bundestag elect thi ha not been tri we had an elect thi year spd green in lower saxoni let me tell you in view of the fact that lower saxoni s minist presid had all the mean of power and the media at hi dispos the result wa not all that overwhelm he repeat hi previou result if i had had such a result in rhineland palatin in 1975 befor i wa candid for chancellor peopl would have said and thei did sai thi is not enough gottlieb the cdu elect result in lower saxoni wa wors kohl excus me the cdu wa in a difficult start posit a young new man achiev an accept result thi is my opinion i cannot see the voter see it that wai it is a matter of dramat chang the futur of germani is at stake we have to stop and see what we can improv where we have to rethink i do not think that the spd green ar the right choic in a period when we ar begin a slow econom recoveri with more bureaucraci punish of hard work with all the social envi and everyth els i do not think that the major of voter think so either and i think that thi is not a veri sensibl discuss we will know for sure in octob and i am sure of my ground fuch there is a famou definit of the polit center the cdu sai it want to win the elect at the center your partner theo waigel the csu chairman sai we have to win the elect to the right of center what is the center what is to the right of it and what ar the issu in the elect campaign kohl if you want to know precis for the cdu it is obviou the center is where i am that is undisput i have never thought much of move to the left i do not think much of go to the right either fuch but waigel sai we have to win voter who ar move to the right thi mean toward the republikan for instanc kohl i think that there is a differ between the frg as a whole and bavaria there ha alwai been a differ i have noth against win as mani voter to the left and to the right of center as possibl but the basi of our parti it histori it tradit is at the center and we do not intend to let anyon els take that ground gottlieb your secretari gener mr hintz recent said veri dramat that the situat for the cdu is of particular concern in the new laender it is below 30 percent everywher except saxoni have you miscalcul the situat in the new laender have you underestim the inherit burden kohl i think that we have all miscalcul on a few point includ myself i miscalcul on particular point or judg the situat incorrectli in 1990 on the dai of german uniti i expect econom cooper which i had develop with gorbachev over the previou year to continu i did not think nor did anybodi els that a few month later less than a year later the soviet union would no longer exist that thi giant would collaps with successor state form that it successor state would deterior so badli econom and that instead of 25 30 billion german mark dm in export from the new laender to these state we ar achiev just dm5 billion thi year we lack the opportun to export our product from the new laender the former gdr to these countri we need a transit period to adjust the compani of the former gdr to the complet differ standard of the world market thi ha had drastic consequ i miscalcul thi point but and thi must also be acknowledg in the meantim thing have stabil and there is a clear upward trend gnp growth rate in the new laender will be between 6 and 8 percent thi year we can see that the labor market is stabil there ha been enorm progress just go to the new laender wherev you go you will see progress in road construct and in other field thi year we will grant just under 100 000 build permit in the new laender thi is an absolut record figur permit have quadrupl over 1992 in just under three year 1 8 million telephon connect have increas to over 4 million insofar as the peopl themselv i would also like to give you a specif figur on the dai of german uniti a pension in the former gdr got between 450 and 550 east german mark todai he get about dm1 300 thi mean the social situat particularli that of the older gener ha improv enorm we manag last year to get posit for all the young peopl who want to train for a job i am quit sure of my ground i am stick to the flower landscap i wa wrong when i talk of four to five year now it might be doubl that but let me sai thi i wa the on who believ in german uniti and help effect it while other were faintheart and anoth group had long betrai and abandon the idea of german uniti fuch but it is a fact of thi german uniti that we had 3 9 million of unemploi in march thi is 100 000 fewer than in the previou month due to season improv in the east but thi is still more than 16 percent unemploy job job job an american presidenti candid entitl hi elect campaign could thi also be an issu for you job could your messag be that until octob there might not be a lot to achiev in thi respect but what sort of timefram do you envis to achiev a basic chang in trend kohl first it would be ly to the voter if we said that unemploy could be overcom quickli thi is not possibl anywher experi ha shown that when we leav a recess behind it take about on year for thing to stabil but and thi is the focal point of your question i am not sai job job job we have to ask ourselv what can we do to improv our econom situat to creat perman job it is not a matter of creat air bubbl it is a matter of rethink our societi our economi and i am sai thi without blame anyon we all have had our share in thi we wait too long regard a few import point over the past 30 year we fail to enforc a few necessari reform take the labor market we wait far too long and accept the fact that we have the shortest machin oper hour in the european union eu thi mean machin ar becom more and more expens and thei ar us less and less togeth with the japanes we ar the no 1 export countri we have becom increasingli expens and it cannot be our aim to move job to hong kong fuch ar you stick with the label of germani as a public recreat park kohl no thi is not a label and i did not sai it thi wai i said that on cannot secur a futur with a public recreat park thi is someth complet differ for me the import thing now is that we must secur our futur we must be competit when i look at a european compani that produc in germani and in the neighbor czech republ and worker work on the same product a few hundr kilomet apart earn dm3 there and dm43 here i do not want to cut wage here wage ar go up in the czech republ but competit is at our doorstep we must wake up now a countri that ha 30 dai annual leav plu 12 14 dai of public holidai that make eight week of holidai ha to ask itself whether it doe not have to do a bit more to secur it futur gottlieb can i be somewhat more specif at the parti congress and afterward you repeatedli mention flexibl innov and said that the futur concept must be part time job is thi someth you want to make a central issu now kohl ye among other thing there is no doubt about thi we know that in germani there ar about 2 5 million peopl who would like to have part time job not just women but also men and there is anoth comparison in the netherland a countri that can truli be compar with germani 34 out of 100 job ar part time job in germani the percentag is 16 i cannot believ that the dutch ar stupid than we ar if peopl s wish ar so sensibl these job must be creat i am veri pleas that my appeal ha brought about posit reaction from employ and trade union we will get togeth after my return to bonn and we want to start a massiv campaign it is quit clear that i do not consid thi a panacea but if we can creat a coupl of hundr thousand part time job thi is a great thing for exampl for young peopl take the situat in firm where apprentic have finish their train and the firm sai i no longer need you in thi posit if thei can find a solut where the apprentic get a part time job for two or three year thi would be a realli good thing that is worth our intens effort gottlieb but much of what you ar sai is what mr scharp is also sai the question is to what extent the voter can distinguish the platform of the two major parti on poll dai kohl i do not share thi fear the spd is complet isol internation if mr scharp present hi view on bundeswehr mission to the socialist intern he will onli caus a gener shake of the head gottlieb we do not want to talk about the socialist intern kohl ye we ar talk about the elect let me tell you again the social democrat have noth to offer on an intern level noth whatsoev in the field of german uniti ostpolitik thei have alwai been in tow behind us the same goe for western polici in european polici thei have not made ani import new contribut in econom polici just compar tax polici what ar thei do now it is the old socialist idea that ar drag out again fuch accord to the chairman of the medium size compani associ your solidar surcharg is also poison for the economi kohl thi mai well be the case but i am not at all interest in what the chairman of the medium size compani associ sai he sai that on the on hand we have to cut public cost and on the other hand cut tax even further but he doe not tell me how i am go to balanc the budget in view of requir in the new laender fuch but you want the solidar surcharg from everyon word indistinct kohl thi is a complet differ exampl but the wai you have put it is quit interest when i announc the introduct of the solidar surcharg indic the date and percentag at the last parti confer there were outcri such as why don t you introduc it immedi these voic were also come from industri if we had done it then your first question todai would have been wa it not a grave mistak to introduc the solidar surcharg so earli back then i said thi will be poison for the economi it is not ideal for the economi now either i know that but i have to weigh thing and what i am sai now is even more import for the economi i can onli balanc the german budget to some extent if i increas revenu in thi situat we cannot further increas debt there is a point where we have to sai stop and we have reach thi and it is necessari to stabil our currenc anoth quit import social issu depend on the currenc name the inflat rate if we have reach below the 4 percent mark and there ar quit a few peopl who sai that we will have on or two month thi year with averag inflat rate of sai 2 9 percent thi is a no 1 social achiev as it mainli concern lower incom fuch mr chancellor let me pin you down more clearli the solidar surcharg for 1995 ha been fix there is no doubt about that the citizen ar most allerg most sensit to discuss of tax thei want to be told clearli what is go to happen let me ask you can you exclud further tax increas for 1995 kohl as regard the tax just mention of cours i want to have thi tax and fuch apart from that kohl i am not sai that thi can be limit timewis i do not see a chanc for thi at the moment how we ar go to solv the traffic problem is a complet differ question i am quit conscious separ these two issu i have not reach a definit view on thi issu yet i onli know that after 30 year we ar final privat the railroad that we ar final get an ecolog sensibl develop in transport by have road and railroad parallel to each other that thi cost a lot of monei i do not need to tell you you have come from munich if you have heard the lament on the radio 40 km 50 km of traffic jam you will know just as well as i do that we will have to reconsid transport polici everybodi agre on that and i am now make a consciou divis between gener tax and transport as far as gener tax ar concern i stick to what i said earlier fuch mr chancellor there is anoth controversi issu within the coalit the deport of kurd kurd who have riot here if i mai put it that simpli the bavarian govern sai that anybodi who doe not respect hi host countri will be deport your justic minist sai thi deport is against the law what is your posit kohl thi is not easi to sai but let me state first that there is no conflict in the coalit i do not know why you think so mr leutheuss ha given her view it is by no mean certain that thi is the view of the fdp fuch but she is a member of the govern kohl no doubt and she doe not repres the opinion of the feder govern in thi matter not to mention my own you want to know my opinion on the problem we should talk about the problem first then about the deport what ha happen in germani is total unaccept thi is not possibl in ani civil countri in the world none at all neither in franc nor in switzerland nor in great britain would it be possibl for peopl who ar here as guest and we ar a hospit countri we want to remain a countri that is friendli toward foreign that these peopl block highwai and caus troubl threaten peopl live in the vicin of their demonstr that polic offic who do their job for us have to do so risk their live thi is unaccept i am not will to bow to the terror of ani group in the street of germani and if it is kurd who came to us with turkish passport thei must be awar of the consequ we do not have anyth at all against our turkish friend who work here but what is unaccept is for domest polici conflict to be carri out here in our street fuch doe thi mean anybodi violat our hospit is to be deport kohl let me give you an exampl from my home a coupl of dai ago there wa thi big demonstr in mannheim i wa not there that dai but i am not will to allow citi to be made into fortress for demonstr and if there is such a potenti of violenc among the 300 000 turkish kurd live here there mai be 3 000 to 5 000 thei must expect the full forc of the law to hit them and second i am for deport peopl third i am for deport peopl onli to place for instanc to turkei where it is clear that the necessari point have been ensur from the viewpoint of human right such as protect against tortur death penalti and all the rest we do not have to discuss thi but it is unaccept for our intern secur and state welfar to be destroi or obstruct by such forc thi is not conceiv in ani countri in the world and i have no inhibit about sai thi veri clearli we will have to discuss thi also with the laender whose respons thi is
