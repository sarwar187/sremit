side wa veri ration in other word by us the best of our previou experi we ad new dimens to these experi in accord with the current situat both in russia and in turkei we ar still go through radic chang in russia pass to the market economi and we have in thi respect similar with turkei we just celebr last year the 500th anniversari of relat between our two countri our relat have veri wide and rich experi and tradit we have experienc good and bad relat but in gener our relat have alwai enter a posit path todai we ar work to bring our relat to a level of strong friendship and partnership chernyshev said both the turkish republ and the russian feder want the relat between the two countri in volum and qualiti to be like turkei s relat with the unit state of america but he said when taken into consider that turkei and russia live in the same area then these relat should have be as publish richer in content we have to work a lot still for thi aim the real formula for thi is written in the declar to be sign when yeltsin come to turkei i want to sai that our countri should increas confid in each other i mean a higher level of confid should not onli remain in word we should look in each other s ey and trust each other he said kurdish confer in moscow but turkei s worri increas when a kurdish confer wa held in moscow last month and new came to turkei that the russian ministri of nation and region polit affair wa among the sponsor of thi confer where the turkish govern s treatment of kurd wa condemn is russia plai the kurdish card against turkei we shouldn t plai those card let me speak about the kurdish confer in moscow the kurdish peopl ar a realiti the kurd live in sever countri in the soviet republ there were about on and a half million kurd todai within the russian border there ar about 500 000 kurd there ar in fact about 100 differ nation live within the russian feder the kurd in russia want to discuss their histori and cultur at a confer and the ministri respons for thi gave the permiss becaus other ethnic nation also hold such confer and an offici from thi ministri attend the confer as a guest but when it wa understood that thi confer wa be exploit for other mean which the turkish side know veri well it wa immedi clarifi that the govern had noth to do with thi confer we also state that such a confer wa not accept in our offici statement it wa also mention that if similar confer with the same aim were to be plan in the futur no permiss will be given there ar alwai the separatist the extremist who exploit such occas we explain to the turkish foreign ministri and discuss all these in moscow with foreign ministri undersecretari bilgin unan we understood each other and mr unan wa satisfi with the discuss in moscow but certainli turkei should also be care not to plai similar card the kurdish confer howev had noth to do with ani retali to turkei thi should be known these ar sensit issu he said it is evid that russia is also suspici of turkei s plai certain card the autonom turkic muslim chechen republ for exampl is caus a headach to russia but is there a terrorist organ of the chechen outsid that of the chechen peopl chernishev said their is a differ kind of terror thei want separ thei sai thei ar independ can thi be accept it should be well understood that we support territori integr of all the countri in the region becaus all these countri ar multin and with multi sect territori integr is a basic principl thi should be preserv veri carefulli and parallel to thi the right of these minor should also be accept and preserv otherwis there will be outburst the yugoslav situat is a veri sad but a veri good exampl for all of us polit and territori integr is threaten by three factor extrem nation religi fundament and separat sometim there is no nation or religi fundament but separat is there for exampl in bosnia thi is the case he said both in turkei and in russia there ar politician who provok these issu without realli know the situat for exampl why should the ultranationalist leader zhirinovskii s statement be taken into consider the ussr wa suppress nation there were no conflict like todai todai there ar extremist in russia but thei should be assess within their own limit we ar in a realli bad situat our peopl suffer their live standard is get veri low so someon like zhirinovskii come and sai he will solv all the problem just trust me and your live condit will improv when i come to offic he sai in simpl term easi to understand and get vote but hi power shouldn t be overestim we ar not scare that the russian parliament will go for hi view plu hi parti the liber democrat parti is a leader s parti and there ar no strong politician in thi parti but when zhirinovskii give guarante to europ sai russia s ey ar turn to the south and not the west thi is enough caus to suspect russia s motiv in the region where turkei is chernyshev said it is correct in the sens that russia be a part of europ is at the same time an eastern countri we ar also a part of asia as is the case with turkei for thousand of year we live togeth with the asian countri we ar us to each other we understand each other and we feel each other and therefor we should continu to live togeth he gave an exampl of thi and said he ha been wit at recept in the russian embassi that toward the end of each recept the turk and russian ar seen convers togeth while the western ar among themselv a region common market he said thi region is our common home there ar four intern format here the commonwealth of independ state the black sea econom cooper the caspian sea econom cooper which is for the time be a weak organ but on which ha the prospect of develop and the econom cooper organ eco when we look at the membership of these cooper we see that the major of the member ar the same in all four of them in other word as an exampl kazakhstan a member of the independ state cannot be a competitor with kazakhstan as a member of the eco so all four organ should be in coordin while each will continu in their separ field of activ and in the long run the cooper between these four organ will eventu come under a bigger umbrella which will be a singl common market a region common market thi is inevit and other countri outsid the region mai also join thi sinc it will be open to europ to the unit state and other thi will be the russian concept vi a vi our southern flank and i will be the person respons for the southern flank of the russian feder chernyshev will be work for thi in moscow and he said thi idea is get posit respons from the countri in the region turkei includ we need time financi possibl and hard work to establish thi i have talk about thi with iranian foreign minist ali akbar velayati in istanbul and he also agre in principl to thi format certainli we have to understand each other better i also spoke with presid suleyman demirel on thi subject and he feel that it is possibl too it is not my project actual but thi is my approach that is find support i want other countri in thi region to studi such a possibl natur ga chernyshev explain that russia could not get from ukrain the 1 billion for the natur ga thei sold thi republ in the last on and a half year so russia had to forc them to at least give certain guarante and we plan to reduc the flow of natur ga to ukrain by on third but there wa no plan to make ani reduct in russia s natur ga export to other countri through ukrain howev we realiz that ukrain wa draw natur ga from the export line we had not thought about thi and the countri at the end of the pipe line which were import ga from russia suffer becaus of thi on march 10 befor wait for the result of our talk with ukrain we start increas the natur ga flow and start from march 13 the same amount of ga will flow to turkei turkei shouldn t worri and the ga that turkei could not get within these dai will be compens too in 1994 turkei will get as much as it want from russia approxim 5 5 billion meter cube cubic meter in accord with our agreement and within the limit of what turkei will be consum thi amount will go up to 7 8 billion meter cube there will be an addit 2 billion meter cube toward 1996 and there will be two more increas made each 2 or 2 5 billion meter cube until the end of thi centuri within the framework of our new agreement chernyshev said he want to underlin that it is not a matter of goodwil onli becaus russia earn monei from natur ga and thei need thi monei therefor we ar awar of our respons and we do not want to lose our imag as a trustabl partner in thi connect i think such develop will not be repeat in the futur he state the caucasu chernyshev state that russia and turkei even in the veri sensit issu such as nagorno karabakh and bosnia herzegovina have similar approach our aim is the same there mai be differ in the mean to reach the aim in some issu turkei ha a harder line and in other russia ha thi is veri normal for exampl not all the european countri share the same view regard the solut to the bosnian situat therefor we should not see these differ as unsolv foreign ministri undersecretari bilgin unan and mr adamishin the russian deputi foreign minist had consult in moscow on these issu too and both of them were veri much satisfi with their discuss at the end of these talk both side found out that the aim is the same i talk with unan after hi return from moscow and he wa realli satisfi i also heard presid demirel sai that he is also satisfi so i think what come out in the press is the result of limit inform he said on the subject of cfe the reduct of convent forc in europ from the atlant ocean to the ural mountain which russia is against when it southern flank is concern chernyshev said russia ha appli for revis of the cfe he said befor the dismantl of the ussr we had a militari unit in the caucasu for defens purpos thi is import after the dismantl thi militari unit wa remov from here a littl further up dure the ussr period we had logist unit we now have onli the logist unit in the north caucasu we had to reorgan the new border we have there thi border is about 1 000 kilomet and accord to the cfe agreement onli 250 tank ar allow here thi will not respond to ani militari standard in europ or elsewher therefor we brought on the agenda that there should be addit technic unit there we want to increas these limit to the essenti limit we do not want to place 5 000 tank there becaus we ar not plan to attack anybodi onli for defens purpos we need a reason amount chernishev said the exist of a commonwealth of independ state should not be forgotten when peopl speak about russian soldier in the region too some do not want to see thi but it is there and within thi framework there is also a defens agreement thi should also be seen for exampl the countri around tajikistan thought there should be joint militari unit to defend the border becaus thei ar under threat these unit compris the russian the kazakhstan the uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan unit we have some unit in georgia and armenia within the framework of the defens agreement thei ar not big unit thi is also normal becaus look in turkei you have american base and why should thi be consid normal while in our case it is seen a threat why differ standard to differ countri he ask he also explain that neither georgia nor armenia and azerbaijan have armi in the true sens even if the ussr armament wa distribut among these countri when the union collaps so from the angl of secur thei feel thei ar not suffici equip thei demand russian soldier for a temporari period and thei ar pai for these soldier chernyshev think there is noth wrong with thi sinc thei ar there for defens just like the turkish third armi in the east ha no aggress aim but is onli there for defens purpos chernyshev said if the azerbaijan author also want soldier then russia will assess that too but so far no such demand came from the azeri side but i think thei want russian soldier at their border with iran but thi issu ha not been settl we have talk about thi with azerbaijan russian soldier ar present on armenia s border with turkei and also on georgia s border becaus these two countri ask for such a presenc the ambassador said russia ha influenc over armenian and serb russia ha a certain influenc over the armenian thi is a fact chernyshev said howev thi doesn t mean we have absolut power over them and we cannot dictat certain thing to them there is a misconcept that russia can make armenia do anyth had the situat been like that then there wouldn t have been ani conflict between armenia and azerbaijan we ar mediat becaus both the armenian and the azeri accept our mediat in order to have success in mediat the conflict side should accept such a mediat turkei is a littl bit differ from russia in thi respect becaus armenia doe not accept it mediat certainli turkei ha influenc over azerbaijan and what i am try to sai is that all side should us their power in a construct product manner chernyshev said that in the case of bosnia herzegovina the russian have influenc over the serb and turkei over the muslim so both countri should work togeth he said russia ha never been against turkish soldier in bosnia besid he said it is not a matter of russian or turkish armi there it is the unit nation peac forc he think peac in bosnia is not far even if there ar the extremist who continu to escal the conflict all side should be push to the tabl chernyshev believ in karabakh too everybodi ha come to understand that thi bloodsh is useless russia s peac plan for the azeri armenian conflict is a ceas fire and armenian withdraw then the csce minsk peac process should work and the solut of the problem should be reach through polit mean certainli we ar support of the csce minsk process and if other countri have addit contribut then thei should contribut for exampl in the bosnian situat you know how it happen the nato plane were about to bomb everybodi wa wait for that and the russian in addit to it particip in the peac process here made anoth contribut and convinc the serb to withdraw their heavi arm if let us sai turkei or the unit state have addit contribut then thei should go along with it chernyshev contend the turkish strait the collis of two tanker that put the bosphoru in flame took place a dai after our interview with the russian ambassador who left ankara a dai after the collis so we could not get hi view about the accid that justifi turkei s stanc on the secur of the strait to our question about russia s present posit concern the bylaw turkei prepar on the subject without chang the essenc of the montreux agreement sign in 1936 chernyshev said when you look at the map russia s onli access is the black sea and the turkish strait we cannot go to the mediterranean from the baltic sea and thi is not onli for russia but all the black sea countri besid all of us should understand clearli a second issu connect to thi in montreux an intern regim ha been set for the turkish strait thi cannot be a matter of good will or bad will there is an intern agreement on thi and we support thi agreement and want to preserv it in the futur other countri in our posit also share thi view and sometim it seem as if it is forgotten but i know that turkei also want to keep thi agreement as it is chernyshev ad russia understand that the bosphoru and the dardanel ar not elast and therefor thei ar not against measur for the secur of the strait as well as measur to eas the traffic meanwhil chernyshev express hi satisfact with the result of hi work in turkei he said of cours i wa not the onli on work to achiev good result our respect administr were in a construct dialogu all the time and i did what i had to do within thi framework when i arriv here everyth wa ripe turkei wa readi and so were we and thu we start he said he is certainli sad to leav turkei but at the same time he doesn t feel that he is actual leav thi countri for good sinc he will be deal with turkei in moscow too i have grown veri fond of turkei as a countri and it peopl mayb

podberezkin rau corpor presid and academician of the russian academi of natur scienc nation secur russia in 1994 todai more than ever befor we need a critic analysi of the path we have travers and a clear object for societi s further develop after all we find ourselv at an histor crossroad there is no turn back but we still have to choos the new road within a veri brief period of time the countri ha move from on histor period to anoth there ha been a radic chang of state structur an end ha been put in russia to the previou polit system which wa underpin by the cpsu monopoli of power and ideolog a headlong chang is under wai in the correl of form of ownership in russia and correspondingli in the entir system of social interrel there is a grow accumul of interethn contradict within russia and of problem with former ussr republ which ar now sovereign state there ha been a fundament chang in russia s posit in the world commun and in it mutual relat with foreign state in thi context it is necessari to clearli defin the current and long term russian nation interest which correspond with the interest of individu citizen and of societi as a whole it is necessari to highlight those on which the veri exist of our state depend in our view the main point todai is to prevent the weaken and collaps of the russian state but how is thi to be avoid have defin the prioriti it would be expedi to elabor a program of reform in the interest of societi as a whole and not in the interest of individu group thi program will obvious be nationwid it must be comrehens realist and pragmat it must not be burden by ani polit bia citizen have the right and even the duti to know what kind of bright futur thei ar offer how will reform be implement and how long thei will take thei ar fulli entitl not onli to ask question about all thi but also to altogeth disagre with the propos program and ultim to demand an account of the govern s activ the wai to nation accord must be sought on the basi of respect for the individu and each citizen s right regardl of parti religi or nation affili what we need todai is a govern capabl of find a wai out of the crisi onli a program gear to the need of the major of the popul will enjoi the popul s support thi is also the onli wai to achiev the consolid of all progress forc it is necessari to curb inflat restor confid in the rubl and creat a normal function financi state mechan gear to support for produc rather than for dealer how do we propos to begin first to abandon the excess of polit struggl and to strengthen legal law and order and elementari execut disciplin without which ani power is doom to anarchi in other word to strengthen the state second to undertak a seri of measur to improv live condit for the russian feder s citizen and primarili for the least well off section pension children the sick and those unabl to work third to uphold russia s uniti and it econom and polit independ fourth to reviv russia s spiritu potenti the main threat is the weaken of power and statehood ani weaken of ani of the branch of power mean the weaken of power and statehood as a whole it is extrem shortsight to sow the branch on which you ar perch it would be much wiser to reciproc strengthen the repres execut and judici branch of power we offer for your attent an analysi of the situat and a packag of measur to strengthen the state section i i preserv of civil peac of an integr and independ russian state 1 preserv of civil peac and accord arm conflict and local war ar increasingli often wage along russia s border the fatherland is on the threshold of a war which could begin either on it border or beyond them it ha in fact alreadi begun therefor the main task todai is to prevent it escal into all out war for thi purpos we need primarili nation uniti and accord no matter how the situat in the countri mai develop it is impermiss to make the state depend on victori by differ view or polit forc politician and their ambit even the most outstand on come and go but russia live on ani polit victori would turn into defeat if a blow is dealt on statehood and societi slide toward confront it is imposs to achiev stabil and accord in societi unless an end is put to the divis into our and their into correct and guilti there is alreadi widespread us of the terminomoli and methodolog of psycholog warfar which ar us dure prepar for the conduct of combat oper against oppon who will have to be sooner or later destroi the divis of citizen into victor and vanquish is a state crime becaus it lead directli to civil war in order to avoid thi and halt thi movement toward direct confront lead politician should be made to first abandon person parti interest in the conduct of affair and promot state interest to the foreground second to find within themselv the courag to ceas the endless search for enemi and declar the respons and repent of all for the catastroph which ha befallen russia our histori show that precis thi spiritu moral approach ha alwai underpin russia s extric from crisi in thi context it is necessari to impos a direct legisl ban on the propaganda of enmiti equat it with call for civil war and introduc penalti for the public of unverifi inform detriment to the state and to civil peac but without prevent journalist engag in critic base on fact democraci and it principl must becom a mean for strengthen rather than weaken the state not a singl polit forc can or should claim to be absolut correct and consequ to exercis absolut power it is necessari to consolid all forc in societi without divid them into red white brown and so on thi approach ha prove pernici for our statehood over the last few decad the econom chao todai ha been compound by interethn conflict the collaps of moral foundat and cultur heritag and final the crisi of polit power instead of a middl class which in all civil societi compris the scientif technic and creativ intelligentsia skill worker and entrepreneur we have creat a minut privileg stratum of dealer while the remain strata ar undergo headlong lumpen at no time and in no place ha thi path ever creat a reliabl support for democraci and state power in societi it is paradox but for mani year on end the state ha pursu an antist polici aim at the disintegr and elimin of it most import institut the armi nation domest polici and the state secur system the most acut problem face the state todai ar a to prevent a civil war b to strengthen the state institut c to prevent russia s collaps d to overcom the socioeconom crisi and save the nation e to preserv scienc cultur and educ cadr pose an especi acut problem when promot peopl to the lever of state administr societi envisag a system of measur to train administr cadr all over the world includ prerevolutionari russia ani citizen who wish to becom a profession politician ha to go through the school of upbring educ and practic befor he is allow access to polit activ in local organ of power in order to be launch into state level orbit the candid ha to climb a long ladder of practic work and train in the unit state befor a citizen can hold promin offic he is polish in a prestigi univers and in the cours of work abroad in the ministri includ the state depart and the cia or parti apparatu in congress and so on the result is a skill functionari meet the need of hi societi s rule circl but even here mistak cannot be avoid the polar of polit forc and their grow confront take the most uncivil form in russia not onli did not end with the elimin of the russian feder suprem soviet but ar actual intensifi the elect campaign consider stimul thi process consequ it is probabl that on section of the rule elit will succe in crystal into a clearli defin parti structur which will attempt to establish control first over the govern and then over the presid de facto reviv the on parti polit system the access of such a parti to power will in turn inevit lead first to a clash between the presid and the feder assembl and then to a leadership struggl within the rule parti itself unfortun the histori of the ussr and the cpsu offer us numer tragic exampl of such develop of event in thi context from the state s point of view there is need for measur for legisl and polit regul of parti activ make provis for temporari suspens of the activ of all parti and sociopolit organ in the event that the natur of their polit activ becom damag to the state s secur thi kind of decis and thi is of fundament import must be made and monitor by the suprem organ of state power subject to on immut condit polit decis must under no circumst becom the prerog of execut and monitor organ like the mvd ministri of intern affair the ministri of secur the prosecutor s offic and so on in our view the ideal author to make such decis would be the judiciari the real strengthen of the aithor and potenti of the judiciari must becom a prioriti task in russia s state build base our analysi on the suprem interest of the state and the nation we have conclud that firm author is need todai the most effect indisput and bloodless form for russia could be an interim presidenti rule monitor by the feder assembl if we were to leav asid polit bia and the ambit of polit leader and forc desir to make capit out of discord in russia we ar confid that mani of our fellow citizen would agre even an imperfect leader of the nation is better than a group of polit leader look primarili after their own interest and corrupt element strain to come to power dure the most difficult time in russia s histori feudal strife invas the time of troubl the countri emerg victori have mobil all it resourc and the spiritu potenti of the mass under a singl leader s leadership the soviet era wa no except see that stalin s dictatorship wa object a posit factor of victori in world war ii and of the countri s reemerg from the ruin the press occasion write that russia todai feel not onli the urgent need but even the inevit of the appear of an authoritarian regim capabl of extric the countri from the crisi some peopl assum that russia ha alreadi taken thi path and therefor the question is not how to avoid a transit to authoritarian but to choos it most accept form and the method for transit we it is said have alreadi diverg from the possibl form and norm of a develop democrat state in the transit period it is therefor necessari to accept thi fact as an object exist realiti and second to try and find a method peac and the on most accept for the state of transit to on of the more prefer form of authoritarian thi assum that new qualiti will be demand of the repres of the authoritarian form of rule leader of the nation rather than of a parti staunch defend of the state and it interest rather than leader of reform a builder rather than a destroy in other word a major revis of the prioriti and valu which have been domin in the last few year the list of these charact qualiti could be logic extend to includ a seriou chang in the disposit of polit forc the transform of recent alli and friend into polit oppon and the obvers the attract of broad strata of profession and specialist not commit to ani on polit parti or movement it mai happen that instead of authoritarian we could end up with incess struggl intrigu by differ group parti and junta and attempt coup with the state and the nation at stake ani such struggl which ha becom an accept form of exist for these leader and a part of their essenc will inevit and for a long time to come hinder and delai the stabil of the situat in the countri and will weaken our might the countri s earliest possibl extric from the crisi and the gradual format of durabl democrat foundat of a civil societi ar import for russia becaus real democraci is possibl onli in a societi where there ar no mortal threat against the state and the nation 2 improv of the feder structur prevent of region fragment what should russia be like follow the disappear of the superpow the soviet union from the world map it former constitut call it the russian feder but is thi realli true a genuin feder is possibl onli when two or sever state ar unit and as a rule it is base on last integr without the right to seced the autonomi of a union state s compon is guarante insofar as it doe not threaten the state s uniti precis thi principl wa us in form the major of feder state exist todai the unit state switzerland canada germani true enough some other state also style themselv as feder argentina brazil mexico venezuela india and spain for exampl essenti howev thei ar unitari state with a certain amount of autonomi for their provinc pseudofeder in the classic sens of the word world experi ha shown that a durabl feder state is possibl onli when it is form by autonom state keen to unit by dint of variou vital import reason more recent histor exampl alreadi prove that ani attempt to creat a feder out of immatur nation and territori format inevit engend instabl and disintegr which swiftli lead to the collaps of newli form state or the format of a unitari state the soviet union wa a feder onli in name proclaim by it constitut but in essenc wa in our view a typic pseudofeder it is well known that a treati between a seri of republ wa conclud in 1922 but in the strict jurid and legal sens not a singl on of the compon agre to the union wa a state as for the rsfsr russian soviet feder socialist republ as on of the contract parti to the creation of the ussr from the veri begin it wa also a pseudofeder both in form and in it inner composit the conclus of the feder treati in it present form did not solv the problem either with whom did the feder compon conclud the treati with the feder state structur to be precis if thei repres a singl state it emerg that the russian it numer largest peopl compris more than 80 percent of the popul ar dispers among the feder compon sinc their own statehood is not even mention furthermor tatarstan and the chechen republ did not sign the feder treati while the stanc of a seri of republ and region as regard the distribut of power is threaten the russian feder s uniti it is fair to ask is the newli emerg russia not a wors variat of the same old pseudofeder it ha to be object note that ever sinc the collaps of the russian empir the ethnic russian have been gradual lose their statehood thi is the fundament question of our commun s develop in view of all that ha been said abov will russia be abl to becom a genuin feder state the fatherland s histori contain sever exampl of attempt to impos a feder unif of territori dure the kievan period right until the invas by the golden hord dure the suzdal muscovi period dure the time of troubl and in 1917 right after the februari revolut it is of cours possibl todai to blame the soviet power for fail to take everyth into consider when form the sovereign republ but the main point is that mani peopl acquir or restor their statehood precis thank to the soviet power the pull toward integr and uniti of the peopl of both russia and the former ussr stem from numer factor the territori which thei inhabit eurasia throughout the mani centuri of their exist these peopl have on mani occas unit within state format and have produc uniqu cultur and singl spiritu area thei perceiv eurasia as their motherland contin whose fate is insepar from the fate of each on of it peopl experi show that whenev the eurasian ethnic group have fail to reach accord their land have becom easi prei for aggressor the struggl for eurasia s repartit could disrupt the world geopolit equilibrium and caus a global catastroph anoth common featur of russia s peopl is the highli polyetnn natur of all newli form state onli six of the multitud of russian peopl claim more than 50 percent of indigen popul in their republ the chuvash account for 69 percent the tuvinian for 64 percent the komi permyak for 60 percent the chechen for 58 percent the buryat in aga buryat autonom okrug for 54 percent and the ossetian for 53 percent the averag indigen popul in all russian feder republ is 32 percent and even less 10 5 percent in autonom okrug it is simpli imposs to divid all thi into some sort of state format the follow conclus suggest itself russia s peopl ar destin to live in on state feder in spirit and form so what ar the wai to solv the nation state question in russia there ar two main danger appar in the possibl develop of nation process todai the first is the uncontrol explos of russian nation as a natur defens reaction to the threat of russia s fragment and to the insult of nation digniti take the form of the russophobia and chauvin typic of some former union republ and of individu nation region in russia itself but the establish of nationalist dictatorship is no solut the lament experi of such dictatorship and regim in a seri of state which emerg on the territori of the ussr offer convinc proof of thi territori and state collaps is as a rule the price that ha to be paid for the triumph of nation idea the second danger li in the attempt to turn russia back to it prerevolut state structur divid it into guberniya in practic term thi would mean the forc colon of nation republ the right which non russian peopl have acquir can no longer be withdrawn or curtail without tragic consequ for them and for the russian nation russian or ani other nation will not onli lead inevit to the destruct of russia s integr but will also render the statehood of these veri peopl just a pipedream the ideal wai to a genuin feder state is to conclud a full blood feder treati between the republ russia s krai and oblast as feder compon must enjoi equal right with the republ with a possibl subsequ establish of new integr format guberniya laender the more extens the level of self govern the more last will be the real integr between feder compon includ the russian region the comprehensivess of thi integr elimin the problem of the russian nation s possibl self dismember in the event that krai and oblast ar elev to the level of republ thu feder could be found simultan on the nation state nation territori and territori principl which would be most in line with russia s specif featur there is need to constitution enshrin the right of nation group and the guarante of cultur autonomi in thi process it will be import to sensibl distribut power between central and local organ of power and administr sinc the two organ of power parliament and govern combin all the origin featur of a multin state in the person of deputi and member of the govern thei would appear to personifi to a larg extent the compon of the feder and their peopl and then the center s authoritarian within the limit of it power would be accept with understand on the other hand authoritarian in the form of a presidenti republ in russia s specif condit could spark off conflict which would be diffitul to overcom and in the event of the adopt of decis which mai be disadvantag for some of it compon it mai even prompt nation agit and protest nonetheless experi show that at critic moment in histori authoritarian as a temporari measur mai be necessari and furthermor justifi the format of a genuin feder russian state will offer an opportun to reviv the larg lost ti with nearbi foreign countri the time and extent of thi new rapproch of peopl from the former ussr will depend primarili on russia s stabil and prosper thi will happen sooner or later and when it doe the eurasian contin will see the emerg of a new commun of free peopl and state qualit differ from all other in the past mainli due to the genuin feder principl underpin it build if oblast even enlarg on ural republ far east republ and so on were to be given the right to have their own parliament constitut embassi and so on thi would run contrari to both intern experi and common sens ani sovereign of administr oblast in todai s condit will lead to the feder s transform into a confeder in light of the current weaken of power thi would be the quickest wai to the state s collaps with all the ensu econom and social consequ which would be extrem seriou for all evid of thi can be seen in the consequ of the soviet union s collaps a strengthen of separat is also possibl even if compon do not formal seced from the feder someth which can alreadi be notic todai what attitud should be taken toward the strive of the leadership of some sovereign republ to take advantag of the feder state s weaken so as to expand their right still further and acquir a special statu in the feder someth like associ member practic ha convincingli confirm that ani excess expans of compon right lead to a weaken and even the collaps of the feder case of secess from the feder by

a feder state which is not bound to uncondition grant to a republ s popul the right to separ even if such a demand ha been back by the major of the popul in a referendum ani such referendum is unlaw and it result can have onli a polit not a legal signific the threat to seced from the feder which can be heard everi now and again run contrari to both the constitut and the feder treati therefor thei have no legal effect and in our view ought to be resolut cut short bear in mind the vast advantag which the republ have alreadi gain thank to their membership of the russian feder their leader ought to abandon their attempt to further expand their right to the point which is tantamount to secess while the legitim right of republ and oblast ought to be cover by addit treati with the feder the forc

should these function be restor on a new basi on the basi of democraci and market relat howev commit to democraci and market relat by itself is not a state idea which can unit multin russia in a unifi state the birth of specif method of transform just like of a state idea is pain nowadai have to fight through the complex of the past and the contradict of the present the basic criteria in thi process could be the minim of social loss the spiritu humanist and moral orient of transform and the balanc of the interest of the world commun and of the russian feder s peopl todai just like in 1991 russia is face the task of how to realli becom sovereign an analysi of the past two year show increasingli clearli that not a singl on of the ni includ russia wa prepar either polit or econom or psycholog for sovereign exist the end of 1991 saw the format of 15 protost without border armi monetari system infrastructur state or nation interest full blood economi and so on it ought to be conclud that even todai not a singl on of these state is full blood in thi sens consequ in 1994 just as in the two preced year their develop will be determin by the follow block of problem a complet the format of sovereign state with all state attribut b creat an effect system of mutual relat between the ni c join the polit militari econom and other system exist in the world open presuppos meet the other state halfwai establish new mutual relat with them and expand the sphere of these relat convers sovereign of each ni and it separ from the union would mean draw awai from it former neighbor in the commun state a certain step up of autarki breakdown of exist ti and alien thi contradict determin the logic of mutual relat between the ni which develop in two opposit direct first there wa an increasingli notic manifest of interst relat establish of custom regim and border most republ the baltic countri ukrain kyrgyzstan moldova georgia azerbaijan belaru kazakhstan ar introduc either nation currenc or ersatz monei on the basi of autonom emiss the financi system is be structur balanc of payment and trade ar be determin the former ussr foreign debt asset and liabil ar be divid debt account is be establish and so on second integr feel ar grow or at least the desir for an earli break is weaken in most former republ except latvia and estonia and partli lithuania and turkmenistan nonetheless todai it is still prematur to talk of integr or disintegr what we ar observ for the time be is the coexist not of the ni but of real author at differ level in these ni for exampl how is it possibl to treat as part of russian kazakhstani relat the tripartit polit econom union of kazakhstan tatarstan and bashkortostan which wa sign in august 1992 and under which bashkortostan ceas deliv oil product to russian depart in 1994 it will be necessari either to make effort to place russia s relat with the ni on the firm basi of intern law or to creat suprast structur with power of author it is more than like that both form will develop in the immedi futur the format of civil relat between the ni will be influenc by the follow factor the incomplet disintegr of the ussr as a result of which the subject of interst relat have not been final defin it is possibl that their number mai be either increas if separat intensifi in russia moldova georgia ukrain and so on or reduc if the process of integr ar intensifi two fundament differ principl ar clearli manifest the nation territori separ into autonom republ and nation territori format and the region separ into pure russian region analysi show that the russian feder s disintegr will hardli end up as a sovereignti bandwagon of autonom format the indigen etnnic group repres even a rel major in onli 11 out of the 31 nation territori format separatist mood ar intensifi in proper russian region in the far east the ural kuban siberia thi ha not been observ either in the ni or in east european countri the follow forecast can be made for 1994 retent of an economi with a price structur out of kilter with world price in 1993 russia suppli product to the ni at price equival to 30 40 percent of world price while purchas from them at price equival to 70 percent of world price and consequ russia had a posit balanc of about 750 billion rubl in trade with the ni in the first six month deterior of the situat of etnnic russian in the ni have becom an ethnic minor there the situat is be aggrav by the fact that virtual all the ni be multin have opt for the nationalist idea in strengthen the state lukewarm attitud of the world commun primarili of the g 7 countri toward individu ni and the structur of mutual relat prevail in the post soviet area it ought to be note in thi context that first in 1992 1993 the major of ni lost their illus about western aid but certain hope remain that some would be integr within the ec while other would draw closer to asian countri and would enjoi their support second there is a steadili grow econom depend on the west and third there is an increasingli clearli manifest tendenc by the west to pursu mainli it own interest in relat with the ni for exampl squeez russia out of the arm market and other technolog market increas purchas of energi sourc from russia at the expens of deliveri to nearbi foreign countri and so on sever system of collabor between the ni will be form in 1994 in on wai or anoth prioriti is be given to the problem of structur the geopolit area with the aim of boost stabil in the region and the manag of polit process 5 wai to form a civil societi term like civil societi and citizen have been increasingli activ us in our vocabulari recent wherea in the past these term were virtual unencount in the mass media and the word citizen wa us primarili by

these thinker perceiv the possibl of a rel autonom social life exist outsid state control there ar two approach toward the civil societi in world scienc todai 1 as a packag of social relat counterpos

virtual all citizen associ which were not approv by the top were destroi ban and driven underground alreadi by the late 1920 s thi result in undermin the econom and social foundat of the civil societi

we have to form a civil societi as a ramifi network of social relat and institut independ of the state express the will and protect the interest of citizen bear in mind the popul s low standard of

it is no accid that these two idea have been juxtapos for a long time the concept of the struggl against crime in the countri wa offici built upon the wither awai of crimin phenomena dure the process

third thi trend persist also in 1993 but the number of record crime hardli reflect the true pictur accord to some expert estim recent there have been some 10 12 million crime commit in russia each

accord to expert estim these relat involv up to 40 percent of entrrepreneur and two third of all commerci structur so far the effort to combat thi grow threat have fail to produc ani tangibl result thi threat ha not even been legisl defin therefor we feel that the best possibl definit is contain in the un secretari gener s report a organ crime is the activ of associ or crimin individu or group

no doubt that the neg effect of organ crime on our societi is grow and affect all it structur at individu collect and state level be a cynic form of lawless which malici violat citizen right and

into apathi and listless right up to the point where the desir and actual will to live ar dull and societi is paralyz becaus noth is sacr and mandatori for peopl in thi situat we ar begin to see the emerg of a stratum of peopl with the qualiti and function of a new intelligentsia the intelligentsia is not affili to ani polit stream it doe not serv either the state or the parti or the church or even the peopl intellig as a human qualiti doe not speak on anyon s behalf but it own base on the theoret principl of knowledg the theoret natur of the new intelligentsia s judgment doe not at all mean that it is aloof from the realiti of life now for exampl it cannot adopt an indiffer attitud toward the russian govern in thi regard the intelligentsia doe not fit anywher within the rang of viewpoint held by variou polit group and variou social strata of the popul from a sounder point of view it can be seen that a chang of govern and of author in gener will inevit result in replac the immatur inconsist at time simpli foolish and clumsi democraci but democraci nonetheless with a quasi democraci thi is the ground on which intellectu determin their attitud toward the govern todai but from the fundament posit the present situat call more for understand rather than for approv or condemn to comprehend and to announc it conclus to societi thi is the function of the new intelligentsia politician intellectu parti and movement want success a member of the intelligentsia want the truth by it veri natur the new intelligentsia need more than anyth els the fullest possibl democraci and it is the on that can util it best of all thi mean that it is capabl of be a kind of regul of the degre and form of democraci the new intelligentsia is also the bearer of optim in a societi of skeptic

in term of year or decad while the new intelligentsia s supraparti and apolit approach enabl it to think in term of the world and of centuri the new kind of intelligentsia presuppos an independ moral it scorn moral prejudic and the domin spirit of the time in the condit of gener accept deceipt and camouflag it is capabl of sincer of the salutari self restrict to noth but implac point out ani manifest of immor to other and in all other instanc imput to dissid noth but intellectu confus the intelligentsia s moral rule out the most perman diseas of intellectu egot and it preach the principl love not me but mine at a time when malici intent selfish and decept in action ar becom an everydai occurr the moral of a member of the intelligentsia call for inact as the last mean of demonstr

will comprehend and explain their role and limit and will bring about a mutual sensibl moder we see the role of prosecutor be plai even by mani gener of literatur the art the human and the social

wa also the judiciari as a matter of fact right until the conciliar code wa compil in 1649 church rule often fill in the gap in state law compris the princ jurisdict it is understand that thi great import of the episcop s judici power wa base primarili on it moral author dure the pre mongol period the metropolitan and bishop often had to reconcil princ at time of civil strife essenti the orthodox church at the time plai the role of a most import factor of nation uniti let us recal that dure the sad dai of the octob 1993 crisi it wa the orthodox church that again took on thi histor role and it is not to blame for the fact that the voic of reason wa not heed it is necessari to dwell on the follow fact grand princ ivan danilovich kalita of muscovi invit metropolitan petr of kiev and all ru to settl in hi capit the foundat of the cathedr of the assumpt of the holi mother of god were laid in the kremlin thi made moscow the perman center of the russian orthodox church give it at

russia s histori offer numer instruct exampl of state organ in parallel with the monarch natur of power in the major of russian land dure the period preced the format of the unifi moscow state we can

as the prototyp of russia s futur democrat structur underpin by the primaci of christian valu but no matter what attitud we mai adopt toward russia s histori follow the unif of ru under the author of the grand princ of muscovi it is necessari to admit that the orthodox church continu to plai an import role in the consolid of russian statehood the 17th centuri prove to be especi import the time of troubl immedi follow the reign of bori godunov which wa mark by a seri of disast and mainli a devast famin again brought forth the orthodox church as the most import factor of nation self awar without which it would have been imposs to pursu state build in russia thu the church s bless of the nizhnii novgorod resist made it possibl to preserv russian statehood in 1612 in 1613 the holi synod in other word the episcop of the russian church and lead repres of it clergi launch the initi of conven an assembl of the land to elect a head of the russian state thi assembl at which the estat of the

privileg from the suprem author but to answer the question of how the russian state should be structur at that time the elect of mikhail the first czar from the romanov dynasti wa condit by the fact that hi father the prestigi boyar fedor romanov who had been forc to becom a monk by bori godunov and later becam metropolitan filaret of rostov and yaroslavl patriarch of all ru in 1619 1633 wa an

if the monarch wa unabl to exercis hi right and duti exercis suprem power in the countri until such time as the legitim claimant to the throne wa sworn in as head of the russian state it must be especi note that the russian church hierarchi plai an extrem fruit role in lawmak activ in which it wa brought by the suprem state power also in the 18th centuri later on when a repres organ of the

swiftli deal with it polit the multiparti system which is capabl of produc a seriou struggl for power is still at it embryon stage as it were in our countri nonetheless we ar inde at a stage of crisi at present and thi crisi is moral the main question face russia now is what should be the moral guidelin of it futur state build thi question ha to be answer by the peopl themselv it would be appropri to recal the tradit form of dialogu between the suprem power and the peopl by conven an assembl of the land which could compris authorit repres of all social and profession group and the tradit religi confess in russia thi assembl would not claim state power and would not compet with the exist repres organ it will not adopt ani act for mandatori execut but it will be abl to identifi the sore spot

social militari and other factor not directli associ with financ ha aggrav thi packag of problem severalfold there is no doubt that all these neg factor and their impact on the financi system will persist also in 1994 at the same time there ar also the mistak and error commit recent which call for special mention the last two year have shown that the overcom of the slump in product and the acceler of structur chang in russia s nation economi cannot be guarante exclus by the mean of monetari and credit polici furthermor such an approach is flaw in it veri foundat in the condit of inflat the capit of enterpris and bank ar be swiftli devalu while credit oper ar be essenti curtail even though the indic without ani adjust for inflat speak of an appar growth of credit oper and foreign currenc on balanc sheet if thei were to be adjust for inflat thei would be sharpli reduc the main caus of inflat ar the sharp declin of product the arbitrari price set by enterpris in condit of monopol and commod shortag the budget deficit the breakdown of econom ti with enterpris in former union republ and cema countri and the export of russian commod at dump price these ar the factor that lead to an imbal between the monei in circul and the commod avil for purchas error in the implement of econom reform and the super rigid monetarist credit polici togeth with confus in calcul have intensifi the slump in product and fuel inflat the main lever for hold inflat back ought to be the credit support for viabl enterpris if enterpris do not receiv credit to meet product cost and cover defer payment thei would be altogeth unabl to function and due to mass product stoppag inflat would be mani time greater in condit that encourag incess price increas and declin of the rubl s purchas power it is imposs to achiev normal commod monei circul includ the mainten of balanc between the total price of commod in circul and the total amount of monei releas into circul what should be the specif measur that would make it possibl to satisfi the commod market at price accept by the major of the popul on of the strateg solut is to restrict the amount of monei in circul last year thi result in a huge total of reciproc nonpay price went up and the enterpris monei evapor but credit emiss is still be curtail by whip up interest rate the rubl s purchas power is fall uncontrol becaus price ar rise without restraint the imbal between the valu of commod in circul and the total amount of monei in circul is widen in a normal econom process monei serv as a technic mean of payment when exchang for commod if there is no monei commod monei circul is slow down and disrupt sinc commod product is curtail although everyon cite the need for credit emiss to be held back by the central bank commod produc enterpris ar in debt thi is confirm by the correl of the growth of price and of monei in circul over a two year period the former increas by a factor of between 100 and 1 000 while the total amount of monei increas onli by a factor of 10 to 15 while commod produc ar cut back and curtail product the budget deficit is grow at a mad pace each year but how ar the state s inordin rise expens to be cover if the enterpris revenu ar fall and consequ budget revenu from taxat ar reduc the differ approxim 20 trillion rubl will have to be cover by monei emiss thi reveal the main caus of inflat budget expenditur ar begin to exce the total valu of commod produc for circul but we cannot avoid deliber and control inflationari expenditur on invest and the product of commod produc even five year ago the countri would have need trillion of rubl to replac worn out equip and thu ensur simpl reproduct thi account for 50 to 60 percent of all fix asset in product at todai s price the amount of monei need would be 1 000 time greater without restor the fix asset we will be unabl to build a market economi and solv social problem meanwhil invest in the last two year have been scanti furthermor a sizeabl proport ha been devalu becaus the invest period span sever year invest in product have been reduc by a factor of about five compar with the minimum that is necessari enterpris ar consum their depreci reserv let alon their profit thi is yet anoth consequ of irrespons and the fals percept of econom freedom evid we should not count on the foreign credit that have been promis therefor in order to reviv the economi we will be unabl to manag without inflationari credit emiss but a credit emiss that is accur verifi and control it must be note that in a healthi econom system

is to achiev guarante live and work condit for russian outsid the russian feder which not onli would rule out ani encourag of their departur but also would realli creat prerequisit for the preserv of their nation tradit languag cultur and nation self awar we perceiv thi prospect as the develop of econom cultur and polit trend aim against ani attempt to establish reactionari ethnocrat regim on the vast space of the former union it is of cours hardli possibl to reli on object reintegr tendenc for reviv that which ha collaps under the weight of accumul contradict and gross error by shortsight politician there is no subjunct mood in histori there is howev an altern to such a develop of event but it is lament it is first the loss of econom independ by the newli form state includ russia follow the disintegr of the singl econom area and the nation econom complex which wa unifi until the recent past their distinct western and their transform into underdevelop appendag of major western countri with a mafia crimin domest econom and polit structur it is second the intent or unintent flare up of inter nation or interethn conflict either as a result of the exacerb and deterior of the socioeconom situat and the impoverish of broad strata of the popul or due to the insolubl of question pertain to nation state belong of variou territori militari properti and other categori of former

which a special type of eurasian civil start develop a long time ago across the space of russia and it associ territori the preserv of on s own state ident todai is a question not onli of human

includ and let us have no illus on thi account in russia itself and will becom a power factor for the develop of interst conflict pretend not to realiz thi mean directli encourag such a develop of event 2 polit aspect a legitim wai out of the situat from all point of view could be provid onli by restor of the common econom cultur and legal area uncondit remov of trade barrier introduct of benefit for member of the new econom and defens union adopt of common citizenship in the ninth year of perestroyka and after three year of democrat russia lack a clear foreign polici concept there ha been no definit of russia s prioriti or a concept of the new integr cooper across the former ussr thi is precis why the sluggish activ of the ci ha produc no posit result russia s nation prioriti must inde be the interest of the peopl of the russian feder and of the largest among them the russian peopl which ha for centuri been russia s unifi nucleu and ha alreadi prove it consolid role consequ all diplomat foreign polit and foreign econom effort must focu primarili on russia s allianc with the former union republ which have a larg proport of russian and russian speak popul thei ar primarili ukrain kazakhstan belaru estonia latvia uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and moldova thi will make it possibl to solv the problem of almost 90 percent of ethnic russian and of mani russian citizen who ar resid in these state it is in russia s nation interest and regardless of the russian diaspora s size to further strengthen the allianc with central asian republ which have prove their commit to the idea of uniti at the most critic time for russia 3 toward integr via coordin there is an impress that out of the entir packag of problem on whose solut the ci ought to be work attent todai is focus onli on two aspect the suppli of russian raw materi and fuel to the ni and the combat involv of russian troop under ci auspic in conflict on the territori of the former ussr and yet the question of paramount import for the peac period of develop settl the issu of citizen right ar hardli ever on the agenda the ci todai certainli need an organ capabl of coordin humanitarian question and eas the pressur of state border on the collect and individu right of citizen of ani nation the ci collect organ could also coordin the process of reform it is hard to reviv our econom mechan while differ part of the ci implement diverg concept of transit to market economi like for exampl when the western republ adher to the genuin sensibl limit of initi privat while russia is engag exclus in macroprivat the destat of harbor and airport oil and gold field and industri giant the problem that could be resolv onli within the framework of a singl socioeconom area ar consider more numer than it might appear at first glanc the problem of refuge whose solut presuppos specif a system of sanction against republ whose democrat liber polici pose a threat to peopl s surviv and to the guarante of their elementari right as well as the provis of complet secondari and higher educ in the nativ languag togeth with question concern the pension provis for peopl who work in the ussr and ar now live in ci state no matter how sad thi mai be to admit but the initi built in disintegr factor still domin the concept of the ci two year later the reason is the lack of a concept of unif of a backbon around which a real as oppos to a nomin commun mai be develop russian and european experi alik show that a real and dynam foundat for the re creation of a singl humanitarian econom and defens area can be provid by the interest of ethnic minor detach from their nucleu includ the largest among them the russian a concept capabl of switch the ci to the track of construct collabor will emerg onli when we abandon the demagogueri abour russian chauvin and all the other tag recent attach to the nation which succeed in realli ralli the peopl on on sixth of the earth s surfac 4 problem of migrat without a forecast of the true extent of migrat it is difficult to determin what financi resourc will be requir to compens refuge and forc migrant for the damag thei have suffer and to provid facil for new settler the number of job that will have to be creat for them the real burden that will be impos on the social infrastructur at place where migrant will concentr and so on the return of russian from former ussr republ and the migrat of repres of non russian peopl to russia began long befor interethn tension reach the stage of open conflict and becam a bargain chip in polit struggl even back in 1979 1988 the posit balanc of the migrat to russia by russian who had formerli activ resettl in other republ wa in excess of 300 000 the growth of the scale of migrat wa also affect by the outflow of nonindigen peopl from region where non russian titular ethnic group had concentr in russia itself the northern caucasu the volga vallei the siberian transbayk region and the northern belt of the feder in essenc these region show the selfsam symptom of discrimin against repres of nontitular ethnic group as in nearbi foreign countri among the advers consequ of mass migrat realli great import attach to the growth of social stress there is a signific deterior of the social awar of migrant themselv who have lost their former statu and quit often the prospect of social success there is also dissatisfact among the resid of town and villag where thei live unfortun the help given to forc migrant or refuge by the local organ of power and popul is clearli inadequ the attempt by migrant to acquir a social nich in the new local come up against seriou object difficulti the level of social tension ha increas wherev refuge ar concentr as soon as thei have appear thi is note both by the migrant themselv and by local resid the social and psycholog atmospher in which refuge find themselv is also indic by the result of a poll of the popul in 13 russian feder region when ask what polici do you support the answer were distribut as follow as percentag of the number poll accept citizen of all former ussr republ regardless of their nation 36 percent accept onli russian by descent 51 percent do not accept anyon 11 percent did not answer 2 percent on out of everi 10 person poll is against the accept of migrant while on half of those poll ar inclin toward divid refuge and migrant into our peopl and foreign these stereotyp of mass and individu awar cannot be ignor thei were graphic demonstr in practic in saratov and volgograd oblast dure the discuss of the question of settl german there and re creat a german autonom format in the volga vallei the local popul s unwelcom attitud toward migrant will intensifi as the shortag of foodstuff hous and so on worsen thi can alreadi be seen at present respond of the all russia poll were ask what will be your attitud if refuge which mai appear in your region ar alloc hous out of turn ar given job and ar help with monei from the state budget the answer were as follow 1 attitud toward help with employm nt posit 58 percent neg 15 percent difficult to answer 27 percent 2 attitud toward help with monei posit 56 percent neg 19 percent difficult to answer 25 percent 3 attitud toward help with hous posit 29 percent neg 33 percent difficult to answer 38 percent the acut of the hous problem in russia where the number of peopl wait for hous is in excess of 9 million wa clearli manifest by the fact that less than on third of those poll ar inclin to support the polici of prioriti hous alloc for forc migrant thi indic of potenti conflict rise sharpli when the ethnic composit of migrant doe not coincid with the titular ethnic group at their new place of settlement in other word mass migrat is fraught with a chain reaction of interethn conflict the symptom of which can alreadi be seen specif thei take the form of grow nation and attempt to initi pogrom against peopl of differ nation or religion in oblast which have taken in larg number of migrant there ar differ forecast about the migrat of russian to russia the number of potenti migrant could includ virtual all 25 million russian live in nearbi foreign countri some 4 5 million peopl in the next 5 10 year thi is the maximum size of the migrat flow which could be prompt either in the event of exacerb of interethn relat or as a result of the start of combat oper on the territori of former union republ accord to feder migrat servic data over the next 12 18 month we can expect between 650 000 and 1 2 million peopl to arriv in russia from nearbi foreign countri 300 000 400 000 from ukrain and belaru 250 000 550 000 from central asia and kazakhstan 40 000 100 000 from the transcaucasu and 25 000 45 000 from the baltic countri the mass migrat of russian from ukrain and belaru to russia and of ukrainian and belarusian to ukrain and belaru can happen onli in the event of militari conflict between the republ although in ukrain for exampl there ar even now forc prepar to instig thi process the situat with russian is even more complex in kazakhstan where there ar about 6 million of them on fourth of all russian live in former union republ outsid the russian feder there is a larg flow of russian migrant from kazakhstan thi trend is grow it is possibl to forecast three avenu and consequ three period of the migrat of russian to russia an activ migrat of first and second gener russian is expect from turkmenistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan azerbaijan uzbekistan and kazakhstan between 30 and 50 percent of the russian speak popul intend to emigr from there some 18 20 percent of russian intend to leav latvia estonia lithuania moldova georgia and armenia up to 11 percent of russian express desir to leav ukrain and belaru accord to poll result about 2 million russian intend to move to russia todai becaus thei feel persecut along nation and linguist line both now and in the futur the forc migrant from union republ ar mainli engin technician skill industri worker teacher and physician in other word strictli urban peopl who will be unabl to settl in the larg citi becaus of resid permit problem thei cannot bui or build hous in town becaus the law forbid it thi is why mani of them perceiv their situat as hopeless there is hardli ani need to comment on the polit view of present and futur migrant or their attitud toward the new polit and econom realiti which have turn them into outcast there ar six special and transit recept point for refuge open and function on russia s territori there is discuss of the possibl of set up similar point and region migrat servic in everi oblast the committe for migrat affair proce from the premis that thi is not onli a calam but also to a certain extent a benefit for russia the govern is begin to realiz that the recept and settlement of migrant will requir larg invest but those return to their histor motherland ar almost the most enterpris skill and industri part of the nation a public committe for the settlement of forc migrant is function in just under on year it ha process about 1 million person and ha help 20 000 but the work on migrat problem is fragment there is no coordin at state level and resourc ar be wast mani categori of migrant have found themselv altogeth outsid the sphere of state regul it is clear that the feder migrat servic will not be abl to cope with the swell flood of migrant on it own the situat call for immedi action there is need for a packag of interlink measur and coordin action by state migrat organ the foreign ministri the committe for emerg situat the state committe for nation affair and the public organ in other word there is need for a nationwid feder program for help to our compatriot furthermor thi program must be given top prioriti from the materi financi and the polit diplomat point of view alik the state s polici toward migrat need more than just seriou amend bear in mind the provision qualit and quantit apprais of migrat and it sociopolit consequ we ar talk about actual elabor a new all embrac and effect migrat polici it main action and principl would appear to be the follow help for forc migrant must includ not onli the provis of compens land credit and employ inform but also the lift of all restrict on resid permit and the choic of place of resid migrant togeth with all other russian must be given equal right to bui and sell at russia s hous and labor market and not be made hostag of suprem state interest the swell or subsid of migrat process will depend at the veri least on polit decis by the leadership of variou republ about protect the right of ethnic minor and the pace at which the indigen of the republ popul proce there must be no delai in elabor more precis guidelin in mutual relat between former ussr republ and compon of the russian feder it is obviou without ani addit research that todai we need to conclud between the sovereign state former ussr republci a treati on the right of ethnic minor to work educ

make much better us of the profession potenti of worker and engin from among forc migrant and refuge to organ the retrain of migrant with a view to reduc the armi of forc unemploi to encourag entrepreneuri activ by migrant temporari benefit in the taxat of small busi to form special budget and extrabudget fund for the effect resolut of these and other emerg problem the republ parliament must revisit the problem of the russian languag s statu it must be given the statu of state languag wherev it is us by the major of the popul thi approach is in line with intern norm and would obvious promot the further harmon of interst relat there also is a press need to conclud interst agreement on human right with all former union republ monitor of their fulfil could be carri out at both state and public level the statu of econom relat with variou state must depend on the observ of these intern agreement and the principl of intern law it is expedi to support the creation of trade and econom center in moscow and russia for russian commun abroad to assist russian in enrol in higher and special educ establish and to sponsor and support russian school and the russian languag and cultur all peopl of russia ar fratern for the russian peopl our peopl desir to live in peac and friendship with the peopl of all other countri our concern about the fate of russian peopl is not aim against other peopl and state russia s path lead through peac solut of problem and mutual cooper to univers and just peac 5 problem of russia s econom mutual relat with ci countri the rate of the slump in product and inflat continu to grow in ci countri in 1993 the govern of not a singl ci republ succeed in halt the process of econom declin on the whole the total volum of industri product in the commun wa reduc by 20 percent in compar price over the year the share slump wa not affect to ani larg degre by the differ natur and pace of econom reform in differ countri in the condit of transpar border and unifi monei circul within the rubl zone the lack of coordin in econom activ hurt the financ of neighbor the imbal in reciproc deliveri ha alreadi evolv into an imbal in the intern settlement of ci countri on the whole it is possibl to agre with the opinion of world bank associ k mikhalopoulo and d tarr the situat as regard trade and payment in the former soviet republ wa distinguish by chao which reflect the exist of a seri of problem the disorgan of the credit monetari and payment system wa at the heart of these problem the main problem is that the reduct of interrepubl trade will promot the further declin of the volum of output and incom therefor polit strategist will have to creat mechan for the transit period which would help the new state to restor the effect flow of trade and avoid further seriou breach of thi flow in the short term support in the longer term the restructur of their economi and it integr in the world economi after all the sharpli increas depend of each ci state on the extern market becom a condit for the function of their economi as a matter of fact these realiti ar onli just be realiz and taken into account in the econom practic of ci countri on the whole as 1993 ha shown the step up of the economi extern depend will continu thi depend will be most graphic demonstr in the sphere of satisfi the ci countri energi need sovereign ha undermin russia s potenti as energi supplier let us add for object s sake that cutback in the rate of oil extract start four year ago accord to estim by russia s ministri of fuel and energi oil extract drop by a further 50 million tonn in 1993 in other word will reach onli 340 million tonn if thi pace of reduc the extract of black gold is maintain then in the veri near futur the fuel and energi complex will be work to meet onli russia s own need which todai stand at 240 million tonn oil export increas more than threefold but thi increas wa accompani by a reduct of deliveri to ci countri by an averag of 50 percent in thi context russia could be suspect of wage a cold war against ukrain and the baltic and central asian countri but such an approach would be base on inertia of thought fact prove whether it is advantag for russia to deliv oil product to the former republ russia deliv it output primarili raw materi which ar competit on the world market to nearbi foreign countri at price equival on averag to 30 40 percent of world price and acquir from nearbi foreign countri output at price equival to about 70 percent of world price moreov in mani instanc russia often fail to receiv ani payment at all for it export for exampl have deliv to nearbi foreign countri about 50 million tonn of oil to a total valu of 6 5 billion by wai of payment it receiv machineri and equip worth onli 700 million but russia s extern econom depend wa also increas and ha almost trebl have reach 14 15 percent of gnp thi is more than in india and japan let alon the unit state extern depend demand addit foreign currenc resourc for the economi s function natur some of the sourc ar ga oil and oil product come back to the idea of cold war against ukrain it is appropri to recal on contenti problem last year ukrain sold abroad at world price of cours 8 million tonn out of the 33 5 million tonn of oil it had receiv from russia accord to some estim the amount earn from thi deal is equal to for exampl the cost of build a major intern airport at sai novosibirsk capabl of earn an annual profit to the tune of 700 800 million russia s economi todai bear the heavi burden of addit export and import expenditur associ with transit charg for cross the territori of neighbor state but the safeti of good in transit is not guarante not even by ukrain of cours the press cite numer fact about russia s debt to other ci republ but the overal balanc is thi russia had a posit balanc of about r750 billion similar trend will also persist next year even though the govern ha taken a seri of measur to put an end to nonpay apprais the situat in russia s econom ti with nearbi foreign countri it can be said that 1993 saw the start of sober up from euphoria in the ci it is of cours prematur to conclud that the balanc of centrifug and centripet forc show that the latter ar stronger but thi awaken coupl with disappoint and lost illus ha also brought in a certain proport of common sens section v v the creation of favor intern condit for the implement of reform in russia 1 exist realiti in order to elabor russia s strategi in the sphere of nation and intern secur it is necessari to analyz the posit it occupi in the world and the essenc of it intern interest as determin by the profound chang of the last few year there ar four main factor make up the system of russia s polici guidelin at least for the 1990 s the first is the fact that the soviet union ha disintegr thu put an end to the world s bipolar structur there ha been a radic chang in the geopolit role plai by russia which ha becom a compon of the world commun russia ha inherit from the ussr 75 percent of it territori 51 percent of it popul 60 percent of fix product asset in term of valu and 76 percent of enterpris produc mean of product it account for 90 percent of oil extract 73 percent of ga extract 63 percent of electr gener 80 percent of crude oil export and almost 100 percent of natur ga export it procuc more than on half of the gnp produc in the ussr in 1990 but russia is not just smaller than the ussr in size it ha found itself in a fundament new environ to the west and to the south where the former soviet republ lie furthermor some of them have been profoundli hit by domest instabl thei ar extrem suscept to extern influenc and ar in conflict with on anoth the paradox is that formal these ar foreign countri as far as russia is concern in fact howev thei remain insepar link with it both by their common histor past and by the multitud of live econom cultur social and psycholog bond the second factor russia is experienc a most profound econom and sociopolit crisi whose solut still li far into the futur at the same time by dint of it size and of the polit and strateg legaci inherit from the ussr russia remain on of the world s lead countri it will not be at all simpl for russia to find it place in the intern arena russia s new leadership bear the burden of a difficult twin task to creat a new system of foreign and domest polici ture it into a catalyst of radic market reform and at the same time to overcom the burden of problem inherit from the past the third factor the russian feder as a genuin democrat republ russia no longer ha a plan economi but it still ha not acquir a market economi the unitari state ha collaps but the best possibl balanc between central and local power ha yet to be found furthermor the feder todai face the threat of disun and fragment into separ princip final the fourth factor is associ with chang in the surround world we ar wit the onset of a more tradit but also a much more complex time of multilater diplomaci intricaci of contradict and coincid of state interest shift coalit and limit polit goal the threat of a univers war is declin but there is a grow danger of local conflict fraught with escal of combat oper in variou region all thi indic that the mainten of peac in the futur will requir activ work by intern and region organ to ensur collect secur as well as joint peacemak action by the power proceed from what ha been said abov what ar our fatherland s main foreign polici prioriti at present russia ha three interlink suprem foreign polici prioriti the first is to ensur polit stabil in the countri prevent war and settl arm conflict on the territori of the former ussr both within and between individu republ primarili by polit mean the second is to prevent the emerg of hegemon power in europ south asia and the far east which would strive to extend their influenc to region in the former ussr where the situat is unstabl the third is to preserv the statu of a great power occupi a special posit in the world s geostrateg structur the main point for russia is to ensur polit stabil and to prevent and settl conflict across the former ussr should instabl and potenti conflict there grow further thi would threaten both russia s territori integr and it econom and democrat reform the maximum desir task is econom and polit integr on the basi of equal right voluntari and mutual advantag for ci countri primarili russia ukrain kazakhstan and belaru if the desir prove unattain then the vital import minimum task for the russian feder is to prevent the creation of a hostil coalit russia is proceed from the premis that the helsinki principl of the inviol of border must provid the foundat of mutual relat between the former ussr republ ani revis of border would be permiss onli via peac talk sanction includ the us of forc would be permiss onli in the event that a countri s leadership pursu a polici of genocid toward ethnic minor and thi is recogn and defin as genocid under un rule germani turkei japan china and other ar potenti capabl of pose the threat of region hegemoni to russia in the 1990 s of cours nobodi is accus the aforement countri of current act along thi avenu but a sober forecast of the shift balanc of forc and of the geopolit situat make it mandatori to consid the possibl of chang in their polici which ar not even contempl at present the unit state is russia s most import partner in counter region hegemoni the remain center of power ar still not capabl of realli influenc the situat in hot spot be thei in the near east angola or yugoslavia the caucasu or afghanistan russia is plan to pursu thi prioriti us differ method in differ region in europ for exampl the guarante for prevent ani militari polit expansion by lead state is perceiv in the develop of european integr and the stregnthen of the csce as an organ of collect secur and collect respons to ani potenti aggressor in the past the ussr us to advoc the simultan disband of nato and the warsaw pact organ wpo not onli ha the nato bloc not been disband but is is actual build up it might thi organ cannot be smoothli transform into a european secur structur we believ that a stabil of the situat in the russian feder on the basi of market economi and the develop of democraci will creat the need for a fundament new intern organ possibl on the basi of util and develop element from the structur of the ec the west european union nato and the csce and with particip by russia the unit state and canada the russian feder s polici in asia minor malaya aziya and south asia could take the form of direct includ militari resist to outsid interfer by agreement with the republ under threat the natur of the multipolar world adjoin the transcaucasu is much more complex russia s partner here is object iran and turkei in south asia the mainten of a certain balanc between them is in line with russia s interest despit the fact that the west would obvious give prefer to turkei as a member of nato the mainten of the us militari presenc in japan is in line with russia s interest in the far east in the event of withdraw by the unit state and of china s headlong econom and militari strengthen japan s reaction could onli take the form of acceler remilitar a clash between the two huge power over korea taiwan hong kong or southeast asia could also involv russia in the conflict ani sharp chang of the balanc of forc in favor of china or japan and the emerg of hegemon aspir in on of the two power could pose a direct threat to russia s far east it is obviou that russia need to retain it posit as a great world power thi mean russia s particip in the un secur council as on of it perman member and it role in other intern structur it also mean particip as far as possibl in the mainten of peac and the repuls of aggress includ along the line of peacemak forc within the framework of the secur council the csce and other and genocid termin oper sanction by the unit nation and region intern organ russia advoc activ prevent of the prolifer of nuclear and other mass destruct weapon a tougher regim to control the deliveri of missil and missil technolog and the elabor of agre quota and restruct on the arm trade as a whole the problem of russia s militari strateg pariti with the unit state deserv special mention it will be necessari to continu the mutual balanc reduct of russian feder and us strateg nuclear forc on new term here we need a transit from mutual deterr through the abil to deliv a crush counterstrik on the aggressor to joint manag of strateg stabil thi is why talk will constitut the sphere of special mutual relat and mutual interest between russia and the unit state 2 nation interest let us examin russia s specif nation interest from the viewpoint of intern secur retain the great power statu thi is russia s natur right vest in it thank to it econom potenti the success it ha achiev in scienc cultur militari might and so on guarante eurasian stabil whenev the eurasian balanc of forc ha been disrupt russia ha tradition been the main victim therefor the desir by ani on state or coalit of state to domin eurasia will not be in russia s fundament nation interest nor can our interest be serv by attempt to isol russia squeez it out of the black sea and the baltic sea reduc foreign econom commod turnov chang it structur and so on ensur polit and econom stabil in state all along russia s border thi is a kei interest for ani power but the problem of prevent the emerg of conflict zone along the border is especi import for russia which ha the world s longest land border and with it complex relat with neighbor which ar root in the past parri and prevent potenti threat the world in which we ar live now is a world of power partnership and power rivalri within the framework of rigid durabl structur despit the chang which have occur in the last few year especi the end of the cold war the improv of relat between the unit state and russia the rapproch to a certain extent between east and west europ and so on more sophist principl of power balanc and power collabor still remain the foundat of contemporari intern relat indic like econom scientif and intellectu potenti plai a greater role in the system of state might but the militari compon still domin the structur of interst power real militari nuclear missil confront on a global level remain onli between russia and the unit state for the time be the continu of nuclear confront between our countri is object and inevit in the forese futur furthermor the grow nuclear missil potenti of the prc and west europ also pose a militari threat for russia in the 1990 s final russia s cultur secur and it origin ar threaten by the west s liber individualist ideolog to the exent that collectiv still domin awar and think and todai s russian realiti at the region level it is necessari to proce from the fact that in the event of exacerb of the domest crisi virtual all of russia s neighbor could potenti rais sundri territori claim although the econom cultur and other categori of secur ar not obvious link with militari secur mani arm conflict have start with mistak commit in nonmilitari sphere therefor the prevent of threat to russia must be activ wage across the entir spectrum thi is russia s main nation interest 3 foreign polici we deem it import to singl out the follow basic object and guidelin for defin the strategi of russia s develop and behavior in the world commun of peopl the russian feder is constantli present in the arena of world polit life it is a differ matter that russia s domest situat and it geopolit environ at present do not favor the pursuit of an activ global polici and it region interest will call for the greatest of effort in the next few year the possess of a mighti nuclear potenti doe not chang the situat either for the first time in mani year our countri is in a situat wherebi it doe not face ani definit or in ani wai signific extern militari threat territori disput involv countri which will certainli not resort to militari forc for their solut provid of cours russia remain a unit state all thi is exception advantag for concentr the countri s effort on the solut of the domest task concern radic transform and the problem constantli emerg in mutual relat with ci countri relat with germani at least over the last two centuri have occupi a central posit among the prioriti of russia s foreign polici but the experi of the 20th centuri

and so on the most vulner sector of the russian feder s border li in the region of interethn conflict it is therefor in our nation interest to extinguish all interethn conflict along the caucasian border and achiev the restor of peac and tranquil there in todai s condit it is imposs to ensur the secur of border between ci countri without help from the arm forc from the polit viewpoint it would be disadvantag for russia to becom the first to introduc arm protect of border with ci countri it would therefor be expedi to begin with a gener accord on border regim what will be the natur of border the extent to which arm forc will particip in their protect and so on it would be expedi if the new state were to us their own forc to protect their border thi appli especi to the southern border thi section of the border ha been close in russia s interest but it is unfair for russia alon to bear the respons and cost it is in the ci state nation interest to receiv guarante against nuclear attack the likelihood of which ha to be taken into consider in todai s world the russian feder is in a posit to back up such guarante at the same time howev we ar interest in have all ci state join the regim

is no worri origin from thi direct at present at the same time it would be prematur to rule out militari danger from the southwest in the event of ani protract of the arm conflict in yugoslavia capabl of involv neighbor countri the conflict s religi aspect is especi danger becaus we ar talk about three faith with adher in mani countri includ the russian feder romania could also produc a seat of

less like turkei such a bloc will inevit try to includ in it orbit azerbaijan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan it cannot be rule out that it might attempt to influenc kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan as well when evalu thi danger it is necessari to take into account the chang natur of mutual relat within the triangl of the russian feder the arab countri and israel the normal of the russian feder s

sink the countri in backward in the third world mani peopl believ that ani expect that the west and the unit state will help the reviv of a mighti and independ russia ar at best naiv the west is increasingli lose it interest in us becaus first we have lost our former econom and militari strength and second we ar no longer claim to be creat a social altern to the west at the same time as can be seen from b clinton s speech in the long term and by attract resourc for it modern from germani and japan and possibl from franc itali and britain russia could weaken competit between the western power in the econom sphere it is also worth note the question of reviv the bipolar system but on a complet new basi the idea of form a second pole is certainli not the product of abstract imagin or a specul project the shortcom and danger of the monopolar system make it necessari to consid the altern idea of a second pole the us monopoli as the sole world leader could tragic destabil intern relat by it veri natur the bipolar system offer a more stabl basi for cooper between the center of world polit it will enabl the third world countri china and russia to protect their common and individu interest in a more or less organ wai and consequ to guarante the greater effect of their effort the creation of a second pole could also strengthen militari polit stabil in the countri adjoin it and could becom an instrument for settl conflict without the west s interfer a seriou motiv for thi could be provid by the need to protect nation cultur asset to counter the expans of western mass cultur and at the same time to pool effort for the shape of competit nation cultur on the basi of the peopl own vital valu and the renew of their tradit equal collabor between all cultur could serv as a counterweight to the hegemoni of western mass cultur which is be implant final a substanti justif for form a second pole is provid by the quest for a new type of civil to replac the domin industri capitalist on whose exhaust and crisi ar increasingli obviou and univers recogn thi object could attract sympathi for the second pole among mani progress stream in the west which ar concern with the quest for a new wai of life collabor between the two center would most probabl lead to posit chang in the natur and content of the first pole s activ and give it a more realist orient even the actual discuss of the problem of creat a second pole could lead to favor albeit partial posit chang in our opinion bipolar will acceler the process of form a global system on the basi of the balanc of interest and becom a step in that direct all of mankind includ the atlant center is interest in creat the second pole becaus it offer a program for extric from the crisi be experienc by the whole world although the second pole is need partli as a counterweight to the first their relat need not be antagonist but could be built on the principl of cooper includ cooper between the unit state and russia a return to the bipolar model of the world is not the onli possibl option the multipolar system also ha it advantag in ani case it is import to ensur that thi system guarante stabil and russia occupi in it a posit befit the statu of a great power 5 disarma problem russia did not inherit ani militari polit alli from the ussr it is object unabl to maintain the mighti arm forc which the soviet union had in mani direct the paramet of russia s defens were move far beyond the limit of it state border now the countri either ha no such paramet or thei have end up be unusu close to it central region the end of the great confront between the two superpow did not lead to the triumph of the principl of nonus of forc in intern affair as proclaim by the unit nation or to the disband of militari polit allianc creat or so the explan went to parri the soviet militari threat moreov the sole remain superpow displai a notic stronger desir to impos it will wherev it feel that us interest exist includ the baltic countri there is no need to explain that if russia intend to solv it own problem guid by it own nation interest it must be strong in everi respect includ by no mean least in defens question we have the full potenti to do so thi doe not run counter to the long term peacemak guidelin proclaim by russia s presid in hi januari 1992 messag to the un secretari gener the principl of effect global and region militari polit stabil declar in thi messag also presuppos measur for mutual disarma thi is precis why russia offici took over from the ussr the baton of reduc the militari potenti of state and eas the level of intern tension it confirm the commit under intern treati and agreement to which the soviet side wa a parti and also sign in januari 1993 the russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start ii thu the track taken by russia in the sphere of the disarma process is in line with the on which the ussr follow dure the last year of it exist but the differ militari strateg condit in which russia now find itself demand of it the elabor of new concept and approach toward the solut of problem concern the arm limit and reduct nuclear disarma problem the salt i and salt ii soviet us agreement in the strateg arm limit sphere were underpin by the principl of equal and ident secur which wa agre by the side it main criterion wa the ensur of militari strateg equilibrium thi in the side opinion not onli coincid with the secur interest of the partner in the talk but also promot the stabil of the world situat but the last soviet us treati on the reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start i contain provis make it possibl to bypass thi principl if necessari the treati s shortcom includ not onli the univers known notion count of weapon which total negat the side initi proclaim intent to reduc their strateg potenti by on half but also a seri of provis place the side in unequ condit for exampl the treati impos stricter limit on land base icbm which have tradition been the foundat of the ussr and now of russia s strateg might at the same time the most liber interpret ha been appli to reduct requir for heavi bomber in which the unit state enjoi a threefold advantag there is absolut no justif for exclud from the treati s effect the strateg sea launch cruis missil which ar object more advantag for the unit state the soviet side simpli fail to obtain agreement from it partner at the talk that the abm treati should be observ while the start i treati is in forc consequ the unit state retain the possibl to chang the strateg potenti to it advantag by implement the sdi program the start i treati ha still not come into forc despit thi a new now russian us treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens weapon start ii wa sign in januari 1993 follow compar brief talk but thi treai is not flawless suffic it to mention it provis on the procedur for the convers of icbm and submarin launch ballist missil from multipl warhead to singl warhead and the reorient of 100 us heavi bomber for the perform of nonnuclear task the start ii treati s provis potenti offer the us side an opportun to re instal more than 4 500 nuclear warhead on strateg deliveri platform within the briefest of time frame bear in mind that the total number of nuclear warhead the side mai hold after the reduct should not exce 3 000 3 500 unit russia run the risk of find itself in a situat wherebi the unit state have for some reason denounc the start ii treati could veri quickli doubl it strateg nuclear potenti under the term of the treati russia should it wish to do the same would not be abl to boost it potenti by more than 900 unit the same wai nonetheless russia ha ratifi the start i treati and ha express redi to ratifi the start ii treati with all their shortcom and posit aspect at the same time it is perfectli clear that the process of the limit and reduct of strateg arm will be continu at some stage it will be join by other nuclear power on what basi should these talk be conduct what should be their ultim goal the question of complet elimin of nuclear weapon will hardli be rais in the forese futur the other nuclear power ar not rais thi task even as an idea the agenda will evid includ the question of arriv at some maximum level for strateg nuclear arm to correspond with the so call minimum nuclear deterr back in the past the ussr express readi to support thi idea and to discuss and agre it strateg mean and basic criteria it might possibl be us to repeat thi attempt nevertheless regardless of whether thi concept will be discuss on a multilater or bilater with the unit state basi russia will have to determin what in it militari strateg posit should be meant by minimum nuclear deterr and thi should be the subsequ guid principl when elabor posit for talk on strateg nuclear arm and on nuclear arm in gener thi will help prevent ani reduct of russian nuclear forc below a certain critic limit it would not go amiss to also apprais the extent to which thi criterion correspond with the start i and start ii treati when accpt the concept of minimum nuclear deterr at the talk it is necessari to bear in mind that thi decis will inevit necessit the examin either in parallel or jointli with strateg nuclear arm of the question of tactic nuclear arm especi if thei ar deploi so as to reach target on the other side s territori includ ship base weapon as well as the uncondit observ of the abm treati limit of convent arm forc and their armament the consist process of disarma must certainli becom the normal polici of ani peacelov state in the post confront period furthermor the outbreak of interethn and other region conflict testifi that the reduct of the potenti of convent arm forc and armament is a task as import as that of reduc strateg and tactic nuclear potenti the continu of talk on convent arm forc and armament is especi topic for russia it is necessari not onli becaus it is becom increasingli difficult to man and maintain such larg arm forc but also becaus we will have to honor committ under the 1990 treati on convent arm forc in europ the parti to which wa the soviet union and not russia thi is not the same thing therefor strictli speak follow the disappear from the militari polit arena of on of the collect parti to the treati the wpo and later on of the ussr new talk ought to be held on the reduct of convent arm forc in europ and a new accord ought to be reach take into account the sharp chang in the situat in thi import region of the planet on 8 juli 1992 russia ratifi the treati under which it also commit itself to the stage by stage reduct of the numer strength of it armi and navi from 2 8 million to 2 1 million men by 1995 and to 1 5 million men by the year 2000 at the same time the nato state did not embark on ani limit and reduct of the numer strength of their arm forc and firmli refus to take naval forc on of the most import compon into account when determin the militari strateg balanc enjoi undisput superior in naval armament capabl of deliv strike against land base target carrier born aviat sea launch cruis missil nato wa unwil to lose thi imbal thi posit is most typic of the entir western approach toward talk on the limit of convent arm forc in europ it envisag the elimin of imbal but onli in those categori of armament where the wpo enjoi the advantag it is clear that ani potenti futur talk cannot leav the question of naval armament outsid the scope of agreement especi as regard armament design to strike against land base target the veri fact of the accept of commit under an accord elabor for anoth state the ussr and for differ militari strateg condit realli goe beyond the framework of ordinari common sens which indic that russia ought to accept and honor onli commit which have been thoroughli and specif elabor for the russian condit otherwis the situat mai reach the point of absurd as it did in 1993 dure the withdraw of troop from germani and the attempt to deploi them in the north caucasu militari district it emerg that russia could not do thi without breach sever provis of the treati it had ratifi it also emerg that russia cannot show ani concern for it southern flank as it see fit sinc it is constrain by limit under thi treati much ha been and is be said about the principl of suffici there is hardli a singl state in the world which would declar that the militari organiz develop of it arm forc is guid by the principl of insuffici or supersuffici therefor the term of simpl suffici is meaningless the term defens suffici or suffici for defens would be more appropri to the concept of russia s defens polici but the mean of even thi term demand thorough elabor onli when thi term ha been given specif content in line with the russian state s militari doctrin it can and must provid the basi of posit for subsequ talk on arm limit 6 the need to improv the mechan for manag militari organiz develop ani polit program of the leadership need a finetun mechan for their implement otherwis thei will remain noth but wish think in the sphere of militari work we ar still nurtur the illus that we ar talk onli of a partial reduct of the arm forc and a partial switch of the militari economi to the manufactur of nation econom output and that the actual mechan for manag militari organiz develop can remain basic the same fundament document in the defens sphere ar be implement with difficulti there is no doubt that the basic provis of the militari doctrin will creat the necessari prerequisit for the organiz develop of de facto new arm forc for russia for the reliabl protect of it interest for the elabor of long term militari technic polici for the creation and further develop of qualit new forc and for the train and educ of the personnel the militari doctrin approv by the presid basic ensur that russia will honor it intern commit on the reduct of armament and arm forc and the mainten of peac the specif applic of the militari doctrin in the sphere of the militari economi is defin in the presid s special edict no 1850 of 11 novemb 1992 wherea onli certain clarifi remark can be made as regard the doctrin s militari and militari technic aspect there ar doubt aris as regard the econom mechan thi is becaus attempt ar be made to retain the old method of manag and adapt them to the complet differ socioeconom condit now develop in russia under the former administr edict system of manag when all element of the econom organ were not onli subordin to the state but also belong to it the main mechan of manag were program and plan five year annual and so on the plan ratif wa follow by the implement of the principl that the plan is law and must be fulfil at all cost at time it wa wreck more often than not it wa fulfil but the mechan function now the situat ha chang radic complet differ law oper in the market economi even the law on defens adopt in 1992 enshrin that the state order in other word the plan issu from abov call for mandatori fulfil onli in wartim financi and econom incent should be us in peacetim the budget and the taxat system becom the main instrument of manag it is therefor anachronist for the militari doctrin in it section on militari technic and econom foundat to reli on elabor and implement of long term up to 10 15 year program for armament and militari equip on the basi of state defens order financ by the state attent must mainli be given to a comprehens substanti and balanc defens budget it is the budget that bring togeth the contradictori interest of variou depart involv in the solut of task concern the countri s defens suffic it to recal the august septemb 1993 outburst of passion surround the budget at the highest level in russia thi is why the budget need independ expert apprais it will help the practic implement of the doctrin s militari polit provis and it is through the budget that civilian control will be exercis over the activ of the power depart thi is why repres of variou nonstat institut advoc a public discuss of the defens budget comprehens control and prompt account for it fuilfil the basic provis of the militari doctrin also contain other weak point which prompt critic by the opposit inde a seri of provis need clarif and amend to the extent that life and russia s militari strateg situat will chang challeng and potenti histori s main lesson is that we won world war ii but lost the leadership race which is run accord to econom rule have lost it superpow statu russia slid headlong to the rank of develop countri and now even of regress countri for the first time in the last 40 year we ar not threaten by the perman danger of global militari conflict but the domest instabl the chao the devast in the economi and the mental of loser pose an equal threat to nation secur the fundament new polit realiti of which our countri s citizen ar becom painfulli awar is that for the first time throughout it thousand year histori russia ha becom a depend countri it depend at least on foreign creditor the dollar rubl rate of exchang foreign aid and invest import deliveri and raw materi price on the world

FBIS3-40922: languag russian articl type bfn aleksandr shalnev report 2 000 to cut up on tank text minsk the repair plant at borisov some 80 km outsid minsk had almost shut down complet a week ago there wa no electr so what s new thi kind of thing happen in belaru all the time mani plant ar stand idl or work at 50 percent capac but repair plant no 140 in borisov is a special plant special becaus it is carri out an extraordinari order it is cut up tank and other combat equip which belaru ha been instruct to destroi under the term of the treati on reduc arm in europ when the treati wa sign belaru wa still belorussia and the tank were soviet but everyth had chang when the treati came into forc the main differ be that it wa now up to minsk rather than moscow to pai for the tank and their destruct cut up a tank is expens as colonel mikhail volochko from the nation monitor and inspect agenc told me 2 000 per tank is the bare minimum but belaru is commit to destroi 1 873 of them within 40 month of the treati s come into forc that is by the begin of 1996 minsk itself must find the monei to destroi these tank there ar no chariti organ and no special fund ar envisag so where is the monei to come from so far it ha been provid by the defens ministri from which sourc from the most expend those intend as alloc to meet the need of offic and warrant offic provid them with social facil and build them the most basic accommod but the defens ministri s budget is not so much hover on the brink it is simpli in a state of collaps if the monei had been avail under no circumst would it have allow the repair plant in borisov to be shut down it will be start up again of cours as there is no altern but to scrape togeth the necessari fund to cut anoth 102 tank and 49 armor vehicl into piec by 12 januari as envisag by the current stage in the implement of the treati but what if the plan is not fulfil what will happen if these commit ar left hang in the air i ask member of the militari and politician will sanction be appli to belaru no overt sanction ar envisag it wa explain to me although covert sanction ar a possibl for exampl an agreement on econom or commerci cooper in which minsk is particularli interest could suddenli at the veri last moment just befor sign be set asid for final touch and adjust the militari and the belarusian foreign ministri estim that the republ need at least 33 million if it is to honor the commit to which the soviet union set it signatur name to destroi tank armor personnel carrier aircraft and other militari equip within the deadlin and to the standard set that is without prompt critic from nato inspector and monitor i repeat thi kind of monei cannot be found in the republ budget not even by make still more draconian public spend cut henc the task to which as foreign minist petr kravchanka told me belarusian diplomat ar devot paramount attent the task of find these 33 million where ar thei look abroad mainli on would have thought noth could be simpler for exampl the unit state ha long had a law name after it author senat nunn and lugar which provid for give substanti aid to some of the former soviet republ for the purpos of their demilitar almost 800 million ha been assign of which more than 70 million is due to belaru but the problem is that thi monei is primarili nuclear that is it is earmark for nuclear demilitar and actual ha noth to do with convent weapon such as tank and armor vehicl nunn and lugar ar perfectli will to alloc and ar alloc 25 million to ensur the environment regener of place in belaru where strateg missil forc us to be station but minsk can go whistl as far as help with destroi tank is concern incident i came across a veri interest report in a minsk newspap recent a high secur correct labor coloni is open on the site of a disband missil unit in ivatsevichskii rayon it will have room for 2 000 prison the report did not make clear howev whether thi is the environment regener refer to in the nunn lugar law and if it is what sum the senat have alloc for thi specif project it seem to me that thi us law and similar law in other countri need some modif and amend obvious you must not look a gift hors in the mouth and so forth but if you think about it it is probabl far more import for belaru to prevent the total breakdown of social program for militari servicemen at present than to implement in full and in a short space of time some of the provis of nuclear demilitar natur i am not suggest ani slow down of pace even the slightest as far as the dismantl of nuclear warhead is concern in thi regard everyth must go strictli accord to schedul for your inform tactic nuclear weapon were remov from belaru over a year ago and 80 strateg missil with 175 warhead remain but it would certainli make sens to try to somehow rethink the secondari or tertiari element in the demilitar program either in term of rearrang prioriti or even in term of put resourc to more econom us peopl in belaru ar grumbl militari and civilian alik some quit openli other in privat or in aesopian term becaus of their statutori oblig thei ar grumbl about the fact that demilitar is be implement not just rigidli but sometim even inan it is iron that the soviet union s economi wa kill by militar while the post soviet republ economi is be strangl by the revers process if the situat in the belarusian economi were just a littl better than it is now peopl do not leav the repair plant in borisov which us to be consid a prestigi establish but now stand idl more and more often simpli becaus there is nowher to go mani other plant ar close indefinit the reaction to the need for belaru to honor it intern commit would be differ more understand there is no doubt that the weapon in question must be dispos of especi those which were dump in belaru by the previou power which never troubl to find out the opinion of belaru and it peopl but perhap it would be worth think about wai to ensur that the demilitar process doe not kill the economi befor it ha a chanc to stand on it own feet and move in the direct of a real market system and that the disarma of belaru doe not lead to social upheav of cours if the 33 million ar found or even 20 million it will be much easier but if not in that case it would certainli be worth rais the question of postpon the destruct of weapon and spread the schedul over sever month or even over a year or so in what ultim doe the west have a vest interest in a countri crush by the weight of it econom problem but with not a singl superflu tank left exactli 40 month from now and not a dai later or in a countri with a more or less accept economi and consequ polit stabil but with a superflu 200 300 armor vehicl which will nevertheless be cut into piec albeit not immedi but after a small delai the fact that belaru take extrem serious the commit made on it behalf by other is not in ani doubt i think thi is partli the reason why onli minsk apart from moscow featur on the itinerari of presid william clinton s forthcom visit to the former soviet union in januari but the unit state is not top of belaru list of foreign polici prioriti russia come first thi is clear from a draft of the republ s basic foreign polici concept a document which must be discuss in the suprem soviet in the veri near futur at the moment it is stamp secret the point of which no on i spoke to could explain apart from on perhap who said if the discuss were conduct openli and broadcast live we would distract and agit peopl then parliamentarian could sai such slander thing about other countri dure the debat that it would caus a scandal i did nevertheless manag to find out someth about the secret document s content first the list of prioriti it is as follow russia ukrain latvia lithuania poland germani the unit state franc britain itali austria scandinavia china india japan and the ga and oil extract ci countri i wa told that a year ago the suprem soviet would not have place russia at the top of the list europ would have been there instead second the document confirm the provis of the belarusian constitut which state that the suprem soviet determin the direct taken by foreign polici and adopt decis on fundament issu thi mean that the govern and in particular the foreign ministri ar assign a subsidiari role be that as it mai the draft of the basic concept ha in fact surviv all the variou stage of coordin and agreement includ in the diplomat depart which ha not bother to kick up a fuss about the suprem soviet be allow to call the shot why not probabl becaus as the foreign ministri and the suprem soviet itself realiz perfectli well thi document is short live design to last on or two year at most also in a situat where to quot ivan tereshko chairman of the suprem soviet intern affair commiss we ar simpli fly headlong there is no point think about someth more perman and stabl or draw up long term foreign polici concept but the document doe have on obviou posit qualiti it must defus the tension which ha develop around the foreign ministri in the last 12 18 month and which ha manifest itself in particular in relat with the suprem soviet leadership relat mark as on can judg from report of parliamentari debat by accus and counteraccus of unprofession incompet and lack of prepar relat give caus to sai as zenon poznyak leader of the opposit in parliament did sai in a convers with me that belaru ha no foreign polici as such i am convinc of the opposit belaru certainli doe have a foreign polici a foreign polici with veri clear guidelin and object which is particularli import thi is evid even from the list of prioriti which doe not featur abstract discuss about common human valu but the

strategi tend to be more of an evalu and preliminari natur at the same time it is obviou that the atlant partner have differ view of the role and author nato ha in the secur sphere and what role and author other intern institut have also stereotyp of bloc think still persist which is true especi in the case of mani repres of the militari leadership of western countri as well as of the allianc as

said that in the present situat the main goal of the allianc besid joint defens of it member is to maintain a strateg equlibrium in europ thi second point can be interpret as a situat in which nato even in the new condit perform on of the main function the kind it had dure the confront period of the cold war if that is so the shift of nato border to the russian border requir either a militari strengthen of russia which howev doe not conform with the kei task of econom develop or russia s accept of an asymetri in the secur sphere which is also against russian interest accord to anoth statement made by woerner on of the main function of nato is to project stabil into the cee countri and central asia if partnership or some other form of nato expans also includ the interest to bring

irrespect of the fact that in nato polit plan russia is no longer consid an adversari in an analog situat the other side would undoubtedli take similar step 2 implement of the mention measur moreov within a limit amount of time undoubtedli will mean exceed the state budget and result in lower russia s defens capabl dure the period of structur rebuild and reloc of the main group of the arm forc 3 it is imposs not to be awar that under such condit danger will aris as a result of the failur to meet deadlin and that exist program for cut and reorgan the armi and turn it into a profession forc as

comparison with the level of the lead militari power 4 if the russian govern prove unabl to guarante normal financ logist support and social secur for the arm forc it could creat dissatisfact among

polit secur is be work out it is orient not onli toward the further fenc in of militari power it also offer the opportun to prepar element of a system of collect secur in europ in my view the goal should be an agreement in which the particip state commit themselv to jointli appeal to the un secur council in case on member of the csce famili disturb peac and jointli appli the result decis the

russia commit itself in the two start treati and in unilater statement thi process of destruct will take at least a decad and will devour sum amount to billion a first of all there is the observ of

and helicopt and whose implement is make good progress later wish for modif must not lead to a revis of the treati itself the unlimit implement of the start packag with the two start treati and the follow up stipul of the lisbon protocol must not be delai ani longer the ratif of start i which ha been carri out by ukrain now onli under certain condit is not suffici in talk with the ukrainian govern and most recent at the csce council meet in rome i have repeatedli advoc that the ukrainian govern should observ it oblig aris from the lisbon protocol and join the nonprolifer treati as a nuclear free state thi would make the path toward intern cooper consider easier for ukrain b the danger of the prolifer of mass destruct weapon give reason for utmost concern therefor the nonprolifer

thi process at an earli time with a polici orient toward the long term for thi purpos it ha conclud an agreement with the russian feder on the abolit of nuclear and chemic weapon and ha made 10 million german mark avail for thi purpos thi year alon in a framework agreement with ukrain too we have declar our readi to provid disarma aid howev thi disarma aid must be further expand and increas c arm control must not exclud special region problem such as the on in southeastern europ for instanc therefor we have taken the initi to discuss with our partner concept of arm control polici for the balkan region which should be implement within the framework of the csce and should be includ in the current effort of the peac process of the former yugoslavia proceed from confid build and stabil measur a reduct limit and restrict of the arm forc of all successor state of the former yugoslavia should be striven for 4 nato too is face the task of examin adjust and supplement it role first step have alreadi been taken other will follow at the forthcom nato summit at the begin of next year the nato minist meet and the meet of the north atlant cooper council on 2 and 3 decemb have establish good precondit for that on thing is clear for the european secur architectur and our german interest the preserv of the central function of the allianc of the protect it provid and of it guarante is as import as the close transatlant ti the presenc of the unit state in europ is an indispens element of a stabl peac order all over europ with the goal of a partnership for peac the secur polici cooper between the european and american member of the allianc is to be extend toward central and eastern europ as a first step the allianc will as i have demand for month offer cooper and consult agreement to non member from central and eastern europ as well as russia ukrain and also other ci state thi is to develop into a network of close cooper relat which ar tailor to the respect partner a network that is to be the express of closer secur polici ti at present and a preliminari stage for potenti membership in the futur with the expans of the north atlant cooper council which i have also propos the allianc will set anoth sign of open up toward the east then the cooper council will no longer be just a dialogu forum but will develop into an institut within the framework of which arm forc in east and west could begin to plan and exercis joint peac mission thi is on of the main reason why the expans by the neutral and nonalign state such as sweden finland and austria which i have suggest is us and necessari the secur which the allianc ensur for it member toward the insid and toward the outsid ha the effect of a magnet all over the csce area therefor the forthcom nato summit should affirm the allianc s basic readi to open up toward new member a partnership of nato with the eastern neighbor must howev not lead to the isol of individu european state therefor a control and gradual open of the euro atlant institut toward the east should make it possibl not onli for the central and east european state but also for russia ukrain and other state of the former soviet union to enter a strateg partnership with nato we must not alarm other with our effort to give some state a feel of greater secur thi appli abov all also in view of the latest develop in russia we must continu our polici of support the reform forc without ani restrict contribut to make russia s path toward democrat structur irrevers and promot russian foreign polici which is orient toward integr in

novemb 1993 took up thi german french suggest at their summit in copenhagen in june 1993 the ec member state stress their intent to accept the new democraci in eastern europ as member as soon as thei

the six page text of the doctrin and it characterist featur suggest that thi is more of a polit document than a militari strateg on is thi in order andrejcak it is after all an exclus polit document it express our aim and object i think that the world accept these principl and that central europ will be a region of peac hric have other state also draft a defens doctrin in such a form for instanc as far as we ar awar the hungarian doctrin is of a more specif natur from which the structur and deploy of the armi evolv andrejcak it is imposs to assum a direct link between the publish text of the defens doctrin and the specif activ of the armi militari expert react to thi polit manifest of the state s will by adopt specif technic and organiz measur and by creat the financi and materi resourc necessari for peac time and a possibl conflict hric the fact of the matter is we ar draft a defens doctrin in slovakia for the first time until now we have alwai accept them from our power patron the french the german and the soviet andrejcak such a comprehens formul militari doctrin is uniqu in the postcommunist state and is also rare in the rest of the world as a rule to me thi doctrin outlin the idea view and activ their declar of the state s polit and militari repres hric is it at all practic to devis a militari doctrin without formul the possibl risk and danger although we can imagin the diplomat firework what would happen then andrejcak we have defin precis the intern and extern risk in the principl for the slovak republ s nation secur howev no state ar mention there becaus we declar our interest in friendship with all state on the basi of equal for thi reason i do not think it is necessari even in thi document to identifi the cardin point soldier have to be abl to react to ani potenti threat to the state regardless of the direct from which it come howev thi is a question of militari strategi and of militari craft which is not promulg in public document hric a too strong armi as well as a weak on is also a sourc of instabl the former arous anxieti while the latter arous the ambit of neighbor do you think our armi ha reach the exact level of so call reason suffici andrejcak the concept of reason suffici evolv dure the dissolut of the warsaw pact when the treati on convent arm forc wa be draft a mean of reduc the disproportion high number of weapon in europ and of maintain the certitud of equal secur for state wa be sought the number of troop and weapon system proce from the extent of the territori and size of the popul of thi or that state thi principl and term were also us dure the divis of the former czechoslovak armi the 2 1 ratio correspond to the size of our popul and the extent of our territori howev the treati allow us to have slightli higher number than a proport nato member would have we have a permit ceil of 46 000 offic and men if we were to reach the level of the netherland or belgium we could reduc the number of personnel to 35 000 if central europ reduc the number of personnel to below the level set by the treati on convent weapon we will also reduc our number you ar right a weak armi is on the whole a pointless wast of monei as is too strong an armi the principl of suffici proce from the certitud of a potenti adversari that in an assault he would suffer such major loss that compar with the possibl gain it would not be worth start on at all howev it is not necessari to have a 1 1 ratio for thi it is also possibl to defend oneself with smaller forc hric on of the reserv of mr slota wa that dure the divis of the feder armi we did not immedi proce with restructur the divis system into the more effici brigad system wa thi realist what is the situat in other state andrejcak some peopl see the brigad system as a condit for our entri into nato thi is not true countri coexist within nato with either system the futur of the armi li in the brigad system for complet differ reason these includ the geopolit posit of our state the possibl for the troop combat function and the need for forc in individu direct that is smaller unit than todai s divis ar necessari but function separ to conduct combat activ for sever dai we could transfer to a brigad system todai howev we would be respons for reduc slovakia s defens capabl for instanc a brigad need a commun system virtual at the level of a divis until we resolv thi issu we can onli form specialist brigad which is not a transit to a brigad system hric the issu of the home guard is brought up repeatedli peopl here note that in the unit state the nation guard almost copi the structur of the armi includ be equip with pursuit aircraft could you reiter the defens ministri s point of view andrejcak no home guard unit is form in peac time in the event of a threat it will be form from the same calib of peopl that complement the field armi the plan unit ar call territori armi unit but if peopl desir the name home guard thei can be renam the aim ar the same regardless of the name howev it would make no sens at all to form such unit in peac time within the framework of the permit number to the detriment of the unit that have far more complex equip and train hric did mr klepac not have someth els in mind when he made thi demand andrejcak certainli not he made it at the time of the joint feder armi so that the unit on our territori would have a slovak command there is no reason now to creat a new ministri or other command for the home guard two system cannot protect the same territori without cooper with each other that would be nonsens hric although prime minist meciar repeatedli emphas hi satisfact with the divis of the feder armi as oppos to the divis of the fleet the airlin cedok and so on mr slota ha publicli air hi misgiv that you

FBIS4-22168: bfn articl by colonel gener mikhail kolesnikov chief of gener staff of the russian feder arm forc problem of flank and futur of treati on convent arm forc text it will soon be two year sinc the treati on convent arm forc in europ cfe enter into forc lai the foundat to real disarma in europ the result of the first stage of the treati s implement attest graphic to the seriou attitud of the russian feder and other signatori state to the fulfil of the commit thei have undertaken as of 15 april 1994 some 7 886 tank over 9 300 armor combat vehicl and 3 458 artilleri system about 900 combat aircraft and 240 strike helicopt had been reduc in europ of thi quantiti russia had reduc 5 155 weapon and item of equip about on quarter all thi confirm the treati s vital at the same time new polit and militari strateg realiti which have now taken shape in europ and the world demand a certain adapt of it posit to the situat s present condit let us recal that the treati wa elabor under the condit of fierc antagon between the two system and their confront and the arm opposit of militari bloc the warsaw pact and nato it is not surpris that it includ provis on the region divis and flank restrict of weapon and equip the main idea of the treati with regard to region divis wa to reduc the danger concentr of arm on the line where the group of the warsaw pact and nato arm forc were in contact primarili in central europ and also to restrict the quantiti of arm in the region next to central europ known as expand central europ in accord with thi idea the region border were determin for the major of countri thei coincid with state border but for the ussr consid the size of it territori and the contour of it region these border were determin by the border of the militari district as a whole the principl of region divis enshrin in the treati and provid for the decant of weapon from the line of contact to deep posit the so call lock gate principl under the condit of confront between the two bloc justifi itself similar aim were serv by the establish of strictli fix and rel low level of weapon for the flank region and also the restrict on depot stock of arm here at the time for the soviet union a singl state with power arm forc the limit on flank forc determin by the cfe treati wa accept it ensur the ussr the build of a reliabl defens both in the north and in the south but with the collaps of the warsaw pact and the soviet union the militari polit situat in europ chang drastic some of the treati s provis were correspondingli in need of certain amend some of these amend have been made the territori of the three baltic state latvia lithuania and estonia wa exclud from the treati s region of oper russia belorussia belaru ukrain azerbaijan armenia georgia moldavia moldova and kazakhstan becam the ussr successor as signatori of the cfe treati overal arm level establish for the soviet union and region level were share among them here the flank water level wa share onli between six successor state belorussia and kazakhstan ar not in the flank region if at the time it wa sign the treati set a specif balanc of region forc then with the collaps of the soviet union and the redistribut of it level among the independ state that aros on it basi thi balanc wa violat it wa for that reason that the flank problem aros for russia it thrust is as follow first under the cfe treati the soviet union in the flank region includ the leningrad militari district the north caucasu militari district the transcaucasu militari district and the odessa militari district had the right to deploi 1 850 tank and 1 800 armor vehicl and 2 776 artilleri system with a calib of 100 mm and abov but after the distribut of the arm allow in thi region between the state which were the ussr successor russia acquir the right to have in regular unit on it flank the leningrad militari district and the north caucasu militari district just 700 tank 580 armor vehicl and 1 280 artilleri system consid that these two district occupi over half russia s european territori and consid their geopolit import these level ar obvious inadequ for the russian arm forc for creat a defens group essenti condit have arisen in which the troop in these district must manag without the necessari quantiti of heavi weapon and i think there is no need to explain what an armi is without modern weapon it must also be consid that the level author by the treati includ weapon and equip not onli of the leningrad and north caucasu militari district but also of some naval compon the coastal defens and

russia six time more tank and 15 time more armor combat vehicl can be deploi than in the entir flank region leningrad militari district and north caucasu militari district taken togeth that mean that the flank restrict push russia toward concentr it convent arm forc on the territori of kaliningrad oblast and along the border with belorussia and ukrain essenti thi lead to the restor of the confront of cold war time along the west east line which run counter to the treati s aim and to europ s desir to creat a new secur system the situat which is take shape is strang to put it mildli the conserv of the flank restrict structur determin by the treati lead to a situat where some peopl can in the interest of nation secur deploi troop where thei consid it necessari while other cannot here the

withdraw of red star tank from the bank of the elb river and the withdraw of soldier from the soviet armi s northern group from our western border reveal what we ar realli worth in a situat where we knew that everyth wa fall apart with our contribut be the biggest of all we sign an agreement on european convent forc that is to sai an arm reduct treati even western politician were surpris that we approv of the proposit submit to us so willingli so we will shortli have to destroi 1 120 tank 247 armor combat vehicl 705 piec of artilleri and 45 aircraft other countri have also been oblig to make reduct but within more reason limit but what will happen later is more import later mean as the final goal we ar entitl to have for instanc 1 730 tank at the most in russia 6 400 tank will remain in belaru 1 800 while in ukrain 4 080 all that is beyond our eastern border what about beyond the oder river the german will have 4 166 tank and keep in mind that everi on of those is twice as effici as a polish tank the russian want to question the treati becaus thei think that thei should be allow to have mani more armament what about us the time for enthusiasm over the chang is gradual fade awai all of our neighbor ar get down to introduc stabil in their countri and i mean polit econom and defens stabil thei ar pai the most attent to the last type of stabil mention here even though thei refus to admit that on the other hand when on look at what we have been do on can have doubt as to whether we know where we ar head a budget of agoni for mani year in the past we were try to scare societi with us imperi and now it is the same case with russian totalitarian in actual fact howev the overwhelm major of polish peopl ar afraid of neither side still the problem is somewher els becaus the line of think by the averag sejm deputi or senat is the same as that of the averag pole on the street such an individu member of parliament is harmless but a group of them with such view can accomplish a lot in the sejm let us take thi year s armi budget as an exampl last year there were just enough mean to surviv while thi year the arm forc ar head for agoni that is not a poetic metaphor even though the issu is seriou there ar few peopl who realiz it i will not list differ item in term of how much the armi can spend on what sejm deputi ar afraid that the gener and colonel will start purchas offici merced car while in fact we can onli purchas 10 tank among other with the alloc monei with these kind of capabl it would take seven year to equip just on armor regiment we have onli a percentag of the requir amount of combat warhead for some type of rocket and 30 percent of requir ammunit for select type of cannon fuel and food reserv which the state should be collect ar also in bad shape i do not even mention the issu of overhaul and erect barrack in new militari garrison that is becaus i have come across a view that sinc a young man ha spent 18 year in a feather bed under a solid roof it mean he will surviv in a tent for 18 month well there is an explan for everyth a major portion of the equip ha alreadi lost it combat credibl that mean that soldier ar no longer trust when it come to their tank aircraft or ship thei ar simpli afraid to shoot take off with their aircraft or go in the water on can continu to us the equip onli thank to the remain spare part and thank to the extraordinari skill of the technic staff the cost of maintain equip continu to rise for those reason among other 820 tank 570 armor transport vehicl and over 5 000 special and gener purpos vehicl were withdrawn from oper in recent year as a matter of fact we do not have to destroi anyth in order to meet the condit of the treati on the reduct of convent arm due to shortag of resourc in a few year time we will have among other thing onli 60 combat aircraft 30 assault helicopt and 1 230 tank thu those number of armament will be lower than those specifi in the treati even the poorest countri that ar reason enough do not allow such a collaps of the armi to occur it is time to sai thi in public politician ar not listen to offic higher rank command ar talk about it howev there ar not mani who ar will to listen to them parliamentarian in turn ar deepli concern about the fate of the iryda aircraft which the armi doe not want becaus it doe not meet the requir paramet the deputi order us to take what thei ar give and to pai thei have alloc 300 billion zloti for that not in addit the monei come from that which we have receiv did thei do thi for the sake of the armi s combat readi or

thi give a special natur to russian american relat extrem delic joint manag of the brittl strateg balanc that the unit state and russia have inherit from the prior histor period is consequ necessari russia will maintain suffici capabl in the next decad to guarante retribut against the unit state but the form and even the substanc of mutual nuclear restraint between the two countri could be

as avert the prolifer of nuclear weapon and the mean of deliv them or restrain the challeng of new power center russia will of cours remain the sole power in the forese futur abl to threaten the nation exist of the unit state and vice versa that abil howev should not necessarili be a caus of rivalri between the two countri the common and parallel interest of the two state could help not onli to control but also to reduc and eas the element of rivalri in relat between them the process of militari disconnect of russia and the unit state that ha start in europ could also affect the far east even though russian american interact in thi region as a whole lag behind their interact on a number of other problem in world polit it cannot be rule out that the conclus of the inf cfe and start

in mani respect of collabor between alli arm control howev cannot and should not be aim at creat a militari allianc of the tradit type such an allianc after all would requir a common enemi while the new intern situat make a search for common enemi unnecessari the task aris in a mutual depend world of joint counteract to common threat in such sphere as global ecolog catastroph hunger diseas and the like let us consid the prospect for concret collabor between russia and the unit state in thi decad a the joint resolut of common problem of the nuclear inherit the paramount task is the creation of a mechan for the resolut of problem connect with the joint resolut of common problem of the nuclear inherit the strateg arm that both countri have todai ar of an inher competit natur thei ar oppos to each other a danger polici of rivalri in the realm of strateg weapon could thu forc both side to continu the arm race even under condit where both side do not have hostil intent or a clash of interest and could lead to a resurg of polit tension between the unit state and russia it is clearli imposs to get awai from the mutual nuclear restraint that wa institution dure the cold war insofar as both side todai possess forc that have been optim for just such a form of strateg interact the problem thu consist of whether it is possibl to strengthen strateg stabil qualit within the framework of the system of mutual nuclear restraint in the short run as well as whether russia and the unit state will move beyond the model of mutual nuclear restraint and move toward relat that ar base on other principl the start 2 treati could larg facilit an improv in strateg stabil under condit of the end of the cold war the decis to destroi a larg quantiti of strateg arm of a counterbalanc natur and abl to destroi heavili protect target in a short time togeth with the decis last year to destroi or put awai a larg quantiti of tactic nuclear weapon provid an opportun for a consider strengthen of mutual nuclear restraint not onli through cutback but through fundament chang in the structur of the strateg forc as well russia ha agre to elimin mirv icbm which wa a signific concess to the unit state sinc russia is depriv of the opportun to make a pre emptiv counterforc strike all of the missil in ukrain and kazakhstan ar be destroi under that decis as well the unit state will thu be left with 500 icbm in singl warhead version and russia with up to 500 ss 25 road mobil icbm and approxim 400 500 singl warhead icbm in launch silo the unit state ha also made a signific concess in agre to cut back the quantiti of warhead on it submarin launch ballist missil to a level ident with russia 1 700 1 750 warhead to reduc the number of warhead on the d 5 submarin launch ballist missil by half and to halt product of the w 88 warhead which would have convert the d 5 missil into an excel counterforc weapon abl to destroi heavili protect target in a short time thi agreement will make possibl a substanti strengthen of strateg stabil the new structur and composit of the russian and american nuclear forc rule out a seri of former scenario of escal and give no advantag in a prevent strike thi signifi that the unit state and russia will move toward more stabl mutual relat even though mutual nuclear restraint remain it will be alter in substanc be redirect toward avert war and not control escal these new mutual relat in the strateg sphere provid an opportun to reject the concept of the reciproc strike reduc the degre of combat readi of the strateg forc and move to a clear cut stanc of adher to an exclus answer strike such a transform could be accompani by broad bilater verif and monitor measur a whole seri of possibl step exist in thi sphere that could be taken by russia and the unit state on a bilater basi 1 the creation of a perman mechan of polit and militari consult to observ the everydai activ of the strateg forc thi could includ the creation of perman liaison mission at the gener staff of the arm forc in moscow at the joint chief of staff in washington and the command and control center of the strateg forc of the respect countri regular meet could also be held by work group to discuss issu connect with interact in the realm of strateg forc and to exchang inform on nuclear plan includ question of the distribut of target and procur of nuclear arm 2 both countri could strengthen current exist nation mean of earli warn of a missil attack through certain joint measur thi could includ the joint launch and us of earli warn satellit that could provid both side with inform in real time and could also becom the core of a global surveil system collabor in the realm of earli warn could includ autom or non autom radar station or sensor optim exclus for the detect of missil launch at missil base and ballist missil submarin base thi would creat unpreced mutual open in the most sensit realm of the nation secur of both nation 3 it is also possibl to reduc the degre of combat readi for all or most of the strateg forc of russia and the unit state through remov from combat alert duti as soon as possibl all arm whose destruct is envisag by the start 1 and start 2 treati remov all nuclear charg cruis missil non guid bomb short rang missil from heavi bomber and store them separ from the aircraft remov from combat alert duti all except a small quantiti 100 for exampl of singl warhead missil in the futur reduc the number of ballist missil submarin that ar on combat patrol reduc the degre of combat readi of ballist missil on the ballist missil submarin that ar at base restrict the combat patrol area of the ballist missil submarin 4 the restrict of danger militari action against strateg facil of both countri could also have a veri import stabil effect the side could agre to certain rule of the game rel to those gener purpos forc that could caus seriou loss of the other side it could be agre for exampl not to conduct air forc or naval exercis close to the base of strateg forc which would creat addit guarante the creation of secur zone for ballist missil submarin area into which the asw forc of the other side could not enter could also be a us and import step 5 collabor in the realm of the safe servic storag transport and dismantl of nuclear warhead continu effort in thi area could help resolv a seriou problem connect with the fact that both side ar to destroi within a rel short time a total of up to 30 000 tactic and strateg nuclear warhead the larg expenditur for these purpos should not forc russia and the unit state to slow thi process the absenc of russian american collabor in thi realm asid from thi could be made us of by ukrain and other former soviet republ in order to keep the nation warhead on their territori from be withdrawn 6 the necess also exist of coordin effort in the realm of nation research the develop of new type of nuclear arm doe not seem necessari todai which make it possibl to halt nuclear test entir thi is necessari in order to preserv and strengthen the regim of nuclear non prolifer these agreement will clearli give russia and the unit state an opportun to move beyond the framework of relat of mutual nuclear restraint the possibl of mutual destruct is preserv but it doe not necessarili requir be lock into a confront system of mutual relat the exampl of the relat of great britain and franc show that mutual restraint is not the sole possibl variat even with the avail of nuclear weapon b monitor the transfer of arm and militari technolog the transit from a bipolar to a multipolar world entail process of diffus of militari forc the cutback in strateg and convent arm of russia and the unit state ar erod the enorm advantag that thei had over all other countri dure the cold war the cutback in thi excess forc potenti ar inevit and plai a us role give the unit state and russia an opportun to be occupi with more import domest prioriti neither the on countri nor the other want other nation to replac them as superpow or to reach a level of militari might equal to them that is why thei thei want to limit the augment of the militari potenti of other power center and to establish monitor of the global process of the diffus of militari forc the two countri thu have on field of overal fundament secur interest as pertain to control the new multipolar balanc of forc 1 the first challeng in thi case is connect with the necess of prevent the destruct of the nuclear non prolifer treati the restrain natur of nuclear weapon could make them a uniqu mean of a great equal of opportun that doe not correspond to the interest of the unit state and russia the non prolifer treati plai a veri import role in limit the number of member of the nuclear club the new situat howev creat a threat to the treati that is why it is import to achiev the inclus of ukrain and the other republ of the former union in the treati as non nuclear state as soon as possibl such an understand could be express by an invit to those state by the unit state russia and great britain to sign the non prolifer treati by a certain date if thei refus to do that the rise of polit and econom pressur is possibl 2 the strengthen of the non prolifer regim could also requir measur to improv the system of guarante of the iaea which could includ much tighter monitor of the whole cycl of exist of the plutonium and other radioact materi necessari for the product a a nuclear weapon the violat of that regim should be subject to sanction by the world commun the deep cutback in the current arsen of strateg and tactic nuclear weapon that exist in the unit state and russia leav at their dispos an enorm quantiti of compon necessari for their product although neither of the side will have ani need for it sinc there is current no regim for monitor the dismantl of warhead both countri could without difficulti come to an agreement rel to the procedur to verifi the the fact that the radioact materi extract ar not be us to produc weapon seal and inspect at warehous could provid substanti guarante of thi thi will make it possibl to achiev tighter control over plutonium by the iaea over other countri 3 the necess exist for russian american collabor to elimin the possibl of the prolifer of other type of weapon of mass destruct wmd which ar easier and cheaper for the non develop countri to obtain the financi and technolog problem in implement the soviet american agreement on chemic weapon that face russia should not postpon the destruct of chemic weapon a global ban on chemic weapon is imposs without thi the unit state should consequ grant russia the necessari assist in order to destroi it chemic arm at the stipul time the american should also be more flexibl with regard to commerci secret in the chemic industri 4 the control of the prolifer of ballist missil that ar potenti mean of deliv wmd is yet anoth import area in the collabor of the unit state and russia russia on the other hand is still not yet a full fledg particip in the multilater control regim for the transfer of technolog for the creation of ballist missil thi lack of clariti rel to the russian stanc is lead to the appear of problem such as the sale of missil to india russia must thu offici becom a member of that regim the current regim is imperfect howev iraq and some other countri were abl to increas the oper radiu of short rang missil successfulli it is clearli necessari to cut back the maximum possibl rang of the missil be suppli to 100 km or even less otherwis a whole seri of countri will be abl to bring their rang to 500 km by improv the missil a great deal of attent should also be paid to the problem of cruis missil especi short and medium rang sea launch cruis missil whose prolifer start with the substanti build up of the naval forc of mani countri 5 the end of the cold war in europ and the treati on convent forc and weapon in europ have reduc the requir of the industri develop countri for mani type of convent weapon tank armor personnel carrier artilleri system combat aircraft and attack helicopt thi will provid a signific impetu for the defens sector of those countri to expand export of product in order to avoid shut down enterpris the import of the arm market in the third world will thu increas and new and modern convent arm will end up in the most explos region such as the near east the coordin of russian and american polici thu seem essenti in order to avert the militari strengthen of such center of power as china india and some of the countri in the near

mani weapon yet disarma like an arm buildup cost a lot of monei foreign aid doe not fulli cover all of our expens when belaru resolv to dismantl it nuclear weapon as well as shoulder the burden for disarma within the framework of the treati on the reduct of convent arm forc in europ it wa an undoubtedli human step that cannot be disput howev we must know how the process of demilitar in belaru is go on and what problem ar be encount our correspond ask vasil puhachow head of the belarusian defens ministri scientif and technic committe to tell us about these issu kalinowski how is nuclear disarma in belaru be conduct and to what degre is it be financ by russia puhachow thi is regul by appropri interst agreement of which the republ of belaru is a successor these agreement determin the list of site while the schedul of withdraw of strateg nuclear forc ha been prepar by belaru and russia at the government level the withdraw of forc is fulli financ by the russian side russia ha also oblig itself to return all clear site to appropri environment condit some of the missil have alreadi been withdrawn in pastavi for exampl launch site ar alreadi clear out but practic no rehabilit work ha been carri out there as of yet earlier the region of smarhon wa a deploy site for old missil system and ss 25 missil accord to an agreement fix structur there have been blown up natur blow up the

now desol villag the environment situat is not be control serious by anybodi there natur the term of withdraw ha not yet expir in addit monetari problem ar plagu both the belarusian and russian govern kalinowski you assum that russia will withdraw it missil but the environment problem will be left to us puhachow no i hope that russia will meet it commit and by wai of joint effort we will return evacu site to their proper condit kalinowski ar nuclear weapon in belaru be maintain in a state of combat readi puhachow ye there ar russian unit temporarili deploi on our territori which will oper as a singl organ until 1996 97 kalinowski i have heard that the ukrainian presid ha the possibl of block ani hypothet launch of missil from ukrainian territori have we such a mechan too puhachow there is an appropri agreement on the intergovernment level which regul the particip of belaru in the resolut of ani such problem kalinowski who control the withdraw of rocket forc from our side puhachow the

defens secretari w perri to belaru there were rumor that belaru will receiv more us aid for it demilitar than other state is that true puhachow ye the unit state ha come up with an initi known as the

the most effici polit mechan for achiev thi goal due to the suprem soviet resolut on the withdraw of nuclear weapon belaru wa the first countri to establish contact with the unit state for cooper in the sphere of demilitar initi onli a framework agreement wa adopt on 22 octob 1993 which wa call on deal with consequ of disastr situat and the prevent of prolifer of weapon of mass destruct follow the provis of thi fundament agreement five other document were sign 1 on suppli of equip for deal with the consequ of a disastr situat for a total of 5 million 2 on the establish of a perman commun

demilitar includ the construct of hous for servicemen as of todai 10 000 servicemen s famili ar without hous 5 on resolut of environment problem in demilitar here the largest sum of assist is expect 25 million the american ar veri will to cooper primarili on thi last problem promis to suppli necessari equip of which we ar lack devic for remot sound and for detail analysi of soil in area vacat by

in the republ not to mention at former militari site at the begin on must carri out a gener examin and take sampl onli then mai we make conclus about soil condit determin the flow of water current and so on i think that some of your colleagu fear mai be substanti kalinowski let us return to the agreement with the unit state and detail what the system of export control mean puhachow it concern control over export of dual purpos good or so call critic technolog which can be util in creat weapon of mass destruct thi is a topic problem the presenc of a system of export control in a countri is consid by the west as the first necessari element for includ thi countri in the global market system therefor the unit state is will to cooper in thi area kalinowski how much us materi assist ha been allot and how much of it ha alreadi been util puhachow it is envis that we will receiv 100 million in 1994 howev it should be ad here that the agreement sign by the us side do not provid for some direct financi invest in belaru that is assist will be render in equip train servic kalinowski by us firm puhachow ye origin by us firm in their turn thei mai either hire cheap labor for exampl to

the possibl of belarusian firm carri out certain work financ by the unit state ha been stipul kalinowski in thi wai the us govern is take care of not onli belaru but also of it busi interest puhachow such a strategi ha been chosen of cours thi is not the best version for us becaus we particularli in the hous sector requir pure financi mean thi wai as it wa resolv a larg percentag of allot mean will go to middlemen unfortun we ar not abl to control it for the time be with regard to your question about the volum of us assist which ha alreadi been realiz in belaru the total sum amount for the

creation of the system of export control and the organ of retrain center for offic kalinowski is the us assist commensur to our need for demilitar puhachow i would sai that thi assist ha a rather polit natur sinc 100 million which is to be allot to assist us will not suffic to resolv even a singl environment problem demilitar is a veri complex and expens process the experi of western firm testifi to the fact that the treatment of 1 cubic meter of pollut soil cost 700 900 german mark anoth complex problem for us is the detoxif of liquid rocket fuel and oxid thei must be remov from the

other technolog for util toxic fuel other than burn it howev burn cost a lot of monei as well the german firm buk ha implement a system for burn solid rocket fuel it cost hundr of million of mark kalinowski how high ar our expens for the reduct of convent arm puhachow take into account our cheap labor forc and certain deviat from environment norm expert estim that the destruct of our tank bmp person carrier and aircraft under the treati on the reduct of arm forc in europ will cost us 33 million kalinowski excus me but lithuania or latvia have no tank at all these countri would probabl like to bui them is it not better to sell our tank to them regardless of how low the price mai be puhachow that is a justifi question thi could be possibl if a more far sight polici were adopt dure the negoti process howev the current agreement doe not allow us to exce the quota that wa specifi in the agreement on destruct it wa agre that we would destroi them and we should do just that an inspect commiss take into account onli those piec of equip that ar brought into a state of useless and cannot be updat or restor onli such item ar regist there is also an agreement allow us to reequip a certain number of bmp person carrier and tank for util in the nation economi specialist at the 140th tank repair plant have alreadi prepar draft and model of fire engin which ar fairli effect in put out forest fire there ar also project for instal telescop crane on tank or bmp undercarriag as well as numer other idea howev take into account the short servic life of a tank engin or it vorac such a project cannot be competit kalinowski it is becaus thei were intend to serv for purpos other than work let us leav the convers of tank and speak about the convers of enterpris in the militari industri complex puhachow actual there wa never such a thing as the militari industri complex in belaru we had a number of enterpris total 100 which particip in the product of complet unit block and element of militari equip yet unfortun we had and still have no integr system no complex due to the halt in order for our product from russia and ukrain as well as to the fact that those enterpris ar incap of satisfi the need of our armi our militari industri complex ha been brought to such a state of crisi despit the fact that about 40 50 percent of belarusian industri had been engag in militari product as of todai onli 3 5 percent of the list requir of the belarusian armi can be satisfi by our industri our countri is compel to bui complet unit block and assembl in russia or ukrain the mean that
