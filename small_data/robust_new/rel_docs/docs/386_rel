as that of the doorbel i see a veri big rang of what kid do with the implant tonokawa sai you see some littl kid take off and develop speech and languag but these ar kid with veri good school support and dedic parent franki correia rememb follow her son around and label each sound he heard the first time we heard the dog bark i told him that s what it sound like she sai and she sai casei also receiv more than two year of auditori train at a school for the deaf the actual train occur outsid of the medic system with usag sai jackson an associ professor and director of neurolog at uci medic center we don t know in advanc where the child will fit in at a minimum virtual all patient will detect medium to loud sound includ speech some can detect certain word in a sentenc without lip read some children also develop understand speech but jackson add it doesn t mean thei don t need speech therapi and other tutori help expert agre that the patient who do the best with the implant ar children who like casei were deaf for a short time befor receiv it but studi have shown that even children who ar born deaf can benefit especi if thei receiv the devic at ag 2 or 3 children ar abl to do so much with so littl jackson sai what s particularli surpris is how well children with congenit loss do compar to adult with congenit loss accord to jackson research on the implant in congenit deaf children ha yield some interest inform about hear develop for instanc young children appear to learn to us the implant quickli becaus their sensori function ar in a rapid stage of growth and develop thei ar learn to adapt to their environ in gener jackson sai there is anoth theori that sound input serv some nurtur role to the hear system with children when you provid that sound earli you can promot more develop tonokawa agre that congenit deaf children mai benefit from the implant although it mai take them longer to master than children who lost their hear after birth there ar peopl who sai you should not implant congenit deaf children some peopl sai thei don t do as well tonokawa sai but i m find that s not true i think it take them longer to get there but thei don t have a histori of hear it make sens that those kid take longer to develop the decis to recommend the implant for congenit deaf children ha been critic by some member of the deaf commun thei have argu that the implant might confus children leav them to straddl hear and deaf environ tonokawa sai befor the feel in the deaf educ field and among some pediatr ear nose and throat physician wa against implant i think we ve won them over by explain that it s just a tool she sai the peopl who ar still veri neg ar within the deaf commun their argument is you re fine as a deaf person and you re part of a deaf cultur and there is no reason to deni your deaf but charl est execut director of the nation assn of the deaf sai he fear that not enough is known about long term effect of the implant particularli electr stimul in the inner ear a concern the fda ha also identifi as need further research i person think that the medic profess should do a lot more public educ make veri veri sure that a candid for an implant understand what to expect befor thei submit to thi kind of surgeri est sai i know a grow number of deaf adult who have had the implant and everi last on of them bar none ha eventu reach the point where thei admit to themselv that it is not what it wa crack up to be and thei just discard the damn thing offici of cochlear corp the us subsidiari of the australian base manufactur of the implant have no inform on long term us but mani expert admit that patient of ani ag must make a concert effort to master the implant or it will be a disappoint on must be commit to relearn how to listen onc thei receiv the implant sai jean lombard a spokeswoman for cochlear corp in englewood colo thei give up becaus it s hard you might be set in your wai if you were heavili reliant on sign languag and you feel you get around and you re not miss anyth then the implant is work tonokawa agre that the right attitud make a big differ in success us of the implant teen ager who have been deaf for a long time often make poor candid she sai likewis parent who have neither the time nor financi resourc to work with their child mai find the implant a wast of monei but she sai children who learn to make the most of the implant have the enviabl abil to feel comfort in both hear and deaf environ my argument is not that we re steal them from the deaf cultur but we re give them a choic tonokawa
