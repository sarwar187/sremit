LA091089-0074: the new view from the top at mca record al teller who took over last week from irv azoff as the chairman of the mca music entertain group sat in hi univers citi offic after hi appoint and spoke wistfulli about the come of the 1990s and the possibl effect on some of pop s legendari figur he reminisc about love such artist as bob dylan the roll stone and the beatl so much two decad ago that he charg score of album at the student store while attend the harvard school of busi but teller shown in the mca record offic at right wonder now if the return thi year of mani of these artist isn t a last hurrah at least as major record seller i think thi return is great for all of us who grew up with them but when 1990 final come it mai be the final nail in the 60s the beard teller said sit at hi desk in a corner offic i m not for a moment denigr their talent or their abil to continu to make great music i m talk about their role in the industri as seller of huge number of album everi gener want to discov it own hero in hi new posit teller 45 stand as on of the industri s kei player in the search for those new hero a new york nativ who is marri with a 15 year old son teller start in the record busi 20 year ago as assist to the presid of cb record divis he later serv briefli as presid of unit artist record and windsong record befor return in 1981 to long time industri leader cb record where he wa eventu name presid leav cb earli last year in what he describ onli as a differ of opinion with cb record head walter yetnikoff teller wa name presid and chief oper offic of the mca record group which had becom an industri forc onc more under azoff s leadership sinc teller s arriv the record divis which gross 661 million in 1988 ha had an especi impress year regist at on point last summer the top three posit on billboard magazin s album sale chart while azoff wa still at mca it wa difficult for outsid to know who wa run the show but now that azoff ha resign to form hi own music relat compani it s clearli teller s oper in an interview about hi plan for mca record teller spoke in a rapid forc confid manner question what did you bring philosoph from cb to mca answer i think there wa a sens of tradit at cb that it wa the tiffani of the record busi total commit to great talent everyth we did wa in servic of and for our artist i think that is still the onli wai to run a record compani q but what about the realiti of make a profit a part of the trick of run on of these compani is to strike the appropri balanc i still howev subscrib complet to the idea of pursu the best most uniqu talent you can find and not worri about how you ar go to get the record on the radio you can deal with radio and market later don t let the busi mechan dictat what your artist vision should be q in come to mca were you concern about work for such a strong high profil individu as azoff a i ve work for a lot of high profil peopl clive davi walter yetnikoff jerri weintraub thi is a high profil busi i thought the idea of come here and help build the compani to the next level wa excit and offer me a chanc to get closer to the street a big part of run cb wa administr and frankli i didn t go into the music busi to be an administr i m pleas at the wai thing have gone we ve had tremend success over the last 12 month highlight i guess by the week we had album on two and three in billboard q you re refer to the bobbi brown fine young cannib and tom petti album could you us the brown album as an exampl to show us your role in motiv the compani a after we work out a deal last year i ask irv to send me all the album and all the video so i could get a sens of what wa go on at the compani the brown album complet floor me it wa alreadi up to about 300 000 or 400 000 unit at the time but i thought we could go a lot further when i came out here from new york and had my first market meet i said i believ we can sell 5 million copi of the album let s figur out how to do it we had numer meet and laid out a solid on year campaign when we had the opportun of do the ghostbust ii sound track the first person we thought of for the album wa bobbi the idea wa to take time out from releas singl from hi own album to releas a bobbi singl from the film thi would give him a chanc to reach a whole differ audienc hi album is about 5 1 2 million now part of what i am suppos to do is stimul the staff s think try to give everyon a gener sens of direct i don t mean take an album that you think will sell onli 12 copi and sai we ar go to sell 10 million of it but it is import to set an ambiti vision becaus everybodi get excit and the project becom a mission q do you feel mca stand in the industri is strong enough for you to compet with ani label for new talent have mca legal problem had ani advers effect on sign new act a in an interview after resign azoff complain about have spent month embroil in a feder investig and legal action that grew out of the record compani s involv with salvator pisello who repres mca in the sale of discount record earli dure azoff s tenur pisello wa subsequ convict of incom tax evas and wa identifi in a govern prosecutor s sentenc memorandum as have long stand ti to organ crime group no mca execut wa ever charg in the probe and pisello ha deni the claim of organ crime ti i absolut feel we ar competit with anybodi becaus ani astut manag is go to be look for enthusiasm and commit thi compani ha all the resourc financi and otherwis necessari i m veri optimist about our futur we ar alreadi a premier label for black music and for countri music and we ar be veri aggress in bring the rest of our line up to that level our a r peopl ar be veri aggress sign a lot of good young rock band regard the legal matter it s a total non issu all we have been talk to our artist and manag about is make music and make career q doe it make more sens for mca record to sign establish big name act at high price or concentr on build new talent a there wa a time when it wa consid a badg of courag if you could steal a superstar from anoth label but to me that wa more a macho exercis than a practic busi move you can probabl come up with some reason why it would be appropri at a particular place and time to go after a veteran act mayb you ar a new label and you want to make a splash and show you ar a major player but ultim the success or failur of a record compani is go to be it abil to find and break new talent overpai for a veteran artist is a major mistak q how do you go about find the next great thing a at the risk of make a gener in a busi where gener tend to becom disastr trap the next great thing is usual someth that is veri differ from the current great thing that s becaus it ha got to be a radic shift a left turn or a right turn and not just anoth notch in the same direct q do you think the 80s produc as mani last superstar as the 60s and 70s a my guess is there will be fewer true superstar to emerg from the 80s on reason is video i don t want to denigr music video i m still a fan of them if thei ar us properli but there is no free lunch with ani of thi and perhap on of the handicap of music video is thei have lessen the motiv for young band to be great live act if you go back to the cover wagon dai of the 60s and 70s part of break an artist wa tour that artist club to club citi to citi so peopl could see the artist and spread the word now that exposur is done primarili through video and that is a highli control environ with video you can redo the song and edit it etc that s why artist have been abl to come from be unknown to sell 2 3 million copi without have to go through the import step of plai and win fan live q what about music trend in the 90s think rap will continu to grow as an influenc a rap is the onli new pop music form to emerg in the 80s and it will continu to be import in the 90s and beyond q did you think it wa just a fad at first a quit the opposit it wa my belief in the import of rap that led to the sign in 1983 of the def jam distribut deal which gave cb a major foothold in the rap scene includ such act the beasti boi and ll cool j it wa consid a shock sign at the time becaus rap wa still consid an inner citi ghetto phenomenon with no crossov potenti whatsoev but if you happen to be in new york and walk down the street you heard rap everywher and kid were get off on it it didn t make sens to assum that it wa go to somehow stai bottl up in the black inner citi commun forev so i wa determin to get into that even though i heard peopl talk about the deal as teller s folli thi is a busi of judgment and if you can t step up to the plate and take a whack at someth you believ in then you shouldn t be in thi game you re not a player
