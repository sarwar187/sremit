process or otherwis us by a facil these chemic will onli be present in the environ as a result of the releas into the environ of precursor chemic if the degrad product meet the toxic criteria of epcra section 313 the precursor chemic mai be consid for list on epcra section 313 the degrad product would not be consid for list on epcra section 313 becaus a facil subject to epcra section 313 is onli requir to file a tri report for a chemic that it manufactur process or otherwis us within the facil boundari therefor epa doe not believ that it is appropri to consid list such chemic at thi time some of the list review by epa includ list that repres wast stream from particular process these wast stream such as coke oven emiss ar not discret chemic or chemic categori but contain a wide rang of

routin manufactur process or otherwis us at level far below the report threshold of epcra section 313 these chemic ar not expect to ever be manufactur process or otherwis us in quantiti at or abov these report threshold in thi propos rulemak epa is attempt to add chemic to epcra section 313 that ar manufactur process or otherwis us in quantiti greater than the epcra section 313 volum threshold and thu would result in the submiss of tri report consequ chemic that ar manufactur process or otherwis us in quantiti less than the epcra section 313 volum threshold were exclud from further consider at thi time becaus no report would be file under epcra section 313 for such chemic some of the chemic that ar manufactur process or otherwis us below the epcra section 313 activ threshold particularli those chemic that ar manufactur in trace amount in wast stream ar highli toxic at veri low dose level and have physic chemic or biolog properti that make the chemic persist for extend period in the

epa request comment on the follow is it appropri to list such chemic on epcra section 313 if epa were to add thi type of chemic to epcra section 313 what modif to epcra section 313 such as lower the

delet a chemic if none of the criteria ar met to ascertain whether there is suffici or insuffici evid to determin that the statutori criteria ar met for list a chemic epa conduct a hazard assess on

unit ii b 3 of thi preambl epa interpret of the specif statutori criteria follow 1 section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect to determin whether the section 313 d 2 a acut human health effect

as a result of continu or frequent recur releas such a determin mai includ among other factor consider of product process workplac procedur pollut control and the volum and pattern of product us and releas as well as other chemic specif factor epa believ that to make the section 313 d 2 a determin it must demonstr that a chemic can reason be anticip to be releas in quantiti that result in concentr level or within a reason margin of exposur of the concentr level that would be expect to caus acut human health effect beyond the facil site boundari the margin of exposur appli is depend

that ar a normal consequ of the oper of a facil from the episod and accident releas that ar subject to epcra section 304 ref 1 as such epa believ that episod and accident releas ar not pertin in a determin that a chemic meet the section 313 d 2 a criterion 2 section 313 d 2 b chronic human health effect in contrast to the section 313 d 2 a criterion section 313 d 2 b doe not requir consider of either the natur and frequenc of releas or concentr level at facil site boundari rather section 313 d 2 b is focus sole on whether the chemic is known or can reason be anticip to caus cancer teratogen or other seriou or irrevers chronic human health effect consequ epa believ that it is suffici to consid onli the toxic of the subject chemic to make the section 313 d 2 b determin 3 section 313 d 2 c environment effect the section 313 d 2 c criterion requir epa to consid a chemic s potenti to caus signific advers effect on the environ the statut direct epa to base it determin on a consider of the toxic of the chemic either alon or in combin with the persist of the chemic or the potenti for the chemic to bioaccumul congress intend that epa consid a broad rang of environment effect when make a

anticip to result in signific advers environment effect in such case epa could reli on toxic alon under section 313 d 2 c i as a basi for list howev for chemic that exhibit advers effect upon the

mai includ among other factor pollut control the volum and pattern of product us and releas environment fate as well as other chemic specif factor and the us of estim releas and model techniqu epcra section 313 d 2 c ii and iii allow epa to consid the impact of other characterist of a chemic where a chemic exhibit signific advers effect in the environ base on toxic and persist or toxic and bioaccumul at veri low to moder low dose level epa believ that exposur consider ar not requir in addit to those consider implicit in evalu of the chemic s potenti for persist and bioaccumul thi is becaus even minim releas of the chemic mai result in elev concentr in the environ or in an organ that can reason be anticip to result in signific advers effect thi reflect the increas likelihood that
