for discuss in the parliament in the work place ar broach these matter ha been the most import aspect of thi first week thi is not onli import but encourag we have seen a conscienti patriot sens i am describ it as conscienti becaus the peopl ar awar of what is be discuss what it entail and of what thei ar propos thei ar not propos measur to affect other thei ar awar of the fact that the measur thei ar propos entail some sacrific for them i have heard worker peopl who do not earn much sai that we must analyz the issu of price increas i have heard them sai that the free public health and educ system should not be elimin more than 30 percent of the countri s budget goe to cover these two servic for exampl there ar provinc like pinar del rio i got back last night from pinar del rio where

read the editori publish by trabajador thei ar listen to the opinion express by report and leader ricardo alarcon wa interview on thi station on thi topic the nation assembl of the peopl s govern anpp wa broadcast for everyon to understand all that is be done and what the goal ar these meet ar an extens of the debat that began at the anpp howev we ar not rehash what wa said at the anpp much creativ is observ at these parliament in the work place thi process we have begun is basic aim at give the worker the opportun to analyz the econom situat of their workplac their enterpris their establish their shop or their subsid unit if thei work for a subsid unit and for them to suggest how thei can improv the work and how thei can chang the unprofit statu that most of the enterpris have as everyon know onli 31 percent of the countri s enterpris ar profit if we continu to experi thi situat the countri will not be abl to overcom it problem no matter how mani measur ar adopt no matter how much excess currenc is taken off the street no matter how mani tax ar implement the situat will not chang if we do not revers the econom situat of our enterpris we must contribut to lower budget expenditur we cannot continu to spend more than we have we have been spend more than we have cruz i have alwai compar the phenomenon of our economi with a basket or a sack it is full and you keep pull thing out if you do not refil it it will eventu be empti thi is basic what is happen with our economi ross i compar it with a cow if you milk the cow time after time but never feed it or give it water it will get sick and eventu die cruz on of the question we have receiv is how long will the streamlin of the economi last will it be a month will it be a year the rate at which the econom measur ar adopt worri me i have heard some peopl sai that thei ar worri becaus thei do not know how long thi discuss process will last ross the streamlin of the economi must be a constant process it is a process the economi must not onli be streamlin but also healthi the econom situat of our product and servic enterpris and the subsid enterpris will depend on our have the necessari resourc to fulfil the plan the countri ha therefor thi is someth we must constantli strive for thi process open a new cycl of econom educ for our worker and administr we must learn that we will onli achiev what we want by work effici if we have on peso and invest that peso we must find a wai to doubl our invest thi is what will allow us to expand to put it simpli we ar seek to make more than we invest we must be consist in thi we believ that thi process will be extend through late februari mayb earli march we must prepar well we do not want thi to be a marathon the idea is not to meet a deadlin sai that we have talk to the worker and thei agre with everyth we ar not reach agreement we ar make suggest we ar analyz problem and the peopl ar make recommend these recommend ar gather and those that can be implement immedi at a work center ar implement the peopl want to know when the measur will be implement we must begin implement the measur immedi especi those measur aim at increas econom effici stop squander pantoja to do someth like that we do not have to wait for an agreement to be reach ross that is correct and thi is import what worri the peopl the most ar those measur adopt to streamlin financ to streamlin our financi situat howev we can streamlin but if we do not solv the econom effici problem we will end up with thi veri same situat thi is the core of the matter cruz the peopl on the street keep ask me on question social justic is noth more than equal distribut of the monei made the question is how ar we go to make monei with so mani problem what can be done to increas product can we produc more despit the problem we encount with the ineffici mismanag and poor work method we have these problem have caus our product to decreas decreas product is also due to the collaps of the socialist bloc and the blockad we ar experienc howev part of thi problem is due to our ineffici ross that is the problem the socialist bloc ha collaps that is a fact and it creat thi problem the sugarmil ar oper we must work that sector with effici our countri s economi depend on thi dure the last session of the anpp fidel encourag us to continu produc sugar to ensur that everi singl pound of sugar is produc pantoja to produc with qualiti ross to produc with qualiti yesterdai comrad carlo lage wa in camaguei and talk about thi we depend on our sugar to get the oil we need to cover our electr need to oper our factori to oper the transport we have there is talk that thi year 200 camel as the train buse ar call by the peopl will be ad to the system and these need fuel to oper that fuel is bought with the monei we get from our sugar sugar bring in most of our foreign exchang we must produc sugar effici our ton of sugar must yield more if produc a ton of sugar cost us 200 currenc not specifi and thi is how much we sell it for then we ar get nowher if produc it cost us 150 currenc not specifi then we have made 50 in profit but if we produc it for 100 and sell it for 200 then we have 100 profit you know that 100 is more than 50 that is what thi is all about the idea is to ensur that the avail resourc ar properli util by the sugar industri and in the canefield and that we work effici the most sugar possibl must be extract from everi piec of sugarcan that reach the sugar mill and thi must be done at the lowest possibl cost the same happen at la corona tobacco factori we visit the other dai it wa the worker who told us what wa happen the worker told us that 750 000 cigar ar not be produc becaus thei cannot get the cover leaf good qualiti cover leaf the cigar that ar produc ar for export purpos howev on and on half the qualiti leaf need for the cover wa be us to produc the cigar the leaf reach the factori howev it wa not us perhap it wa damag in the process becaus it wa not treat properli cruz it wa broken ross it wa broken perhap the leaf select process wa not properli carri out perhap the wrong type of leaf wa sent to the section produc anoth brand of cigar onc thi occur the leaf must be sent back and in the process it is damag or it is never return to the right place mani of these thing happen therefor it is not the same to produc 5 5 million cigar as the worker did in 1993 as it is to produc 6 250 million cigar thi is what we ar talk about whatev is up to us to produc more effici we must attempt to do with more effici that is the heart of the matter pantoja there is someth you mention a littl while ago soledad talk about the need to produc if there is no product there is no welfar and there ar no materi good we mai have the monei but if there is no product there is no merchandis and if there is no merchandis the peopl cannot spend the monei and that monei stai in the peopl s pocket cruz we ar at a standstil and thi situat must be chang ross i believ the statement carlo lage made yesterdai ar veri import thei bring us hope thei repres a light for us lage said last night i saw him on televis and later heard him on the radio that there ar industri that ar begin to produc some of these industri began produc a few month ago but he said that there is some reactiv some reactiv not much but that we ar begin to see some reactiv of our economi in the industri sector pantoja tourism for exampl tourism is a sourc of incom for cuba ross tourism produc a profit that profit will be higher to the extent we increas it effici reduc it cost and increas it qualiti as much as possibl that is what it is all about for exampl educ is a budget sector where we alloc a myriad of resourc we have to try to do a qualiti job and we have been work toward that goal thi process will also analyz thi issu the qualiti of the educ and the maximum us and improv of educ mechan in order to not squander the budget we have to try to elimin from the budget those expens which ar at time superflu ar made unnecessari or ar squander cruz there is a question regard all the inform i have heard on radio and televis and it is in connect with a queri by a viewer and a listen if the measur taken ar anti popular what is the state go to do and i want to comment in thi regard i believ that on of the thing we have to attain is to educ everyon on differ principl i find it fright how we have develop a mental of right yet speak veri littl of respons we do thi with almost everyth even with our children and parent children have thi and that right given to them by the constitut as a result of their condit as children and the same is true of youth howev nowher doe it sai what the children s respons ar to their parent thi is on exampl the same thing happen with the state and revolut everyon ha a right to educ everyon ha a right to health care everyon ha a right and right and right a right to retir benefit to work to receiv help to everyth what about respons what ar we go to do to fulfil them there ar peopl concern with anti popular measur we have to see what we defin as anti popular when i speak with peopl on the street from divers sector throughout the land the peopl fierc critic egalitar and that the peopl who do not work have the same right or more than those who do all thi is critic there ar mani peopl from gener that experienc capit for exampl thi ladi who wrote to us in pacheco castillo she stress thi in her letter in which she pour out all her opinion on thi issu she experienc capit she said we have to understand certain thing we cannot continu shape peopl with everi right sinc birth and yet give them no sens of oblig in thi sens i believ that there ar educ and health issu which i think ar an extrem import accomplish and should be kept free howev we must also give the citizen as earli in life as possibl a sens of respons it is incred how book which could have been preserv and window and school chair have been broken and how the school ar not care for in the manner thei should be i do believ that there should be tax measur to cover when a book a window or social properti is damag it is like the state is an open pipe that can provid all these thing ross i believ that until the collaps of the socialist bloc mani thing were provid too gener and that generos is precis what provok our action thi is my opinion on the other hand now have to confront the current problem of the economi the situat of the econom crisi all these problem and even the capitalist crisi the world econom crisi thi affect us more todai becaus it is undisput that we have to fend for ourselv thu we feel these crise more we do not have the support or intern aid of yesterdai logic all these thing make us do thi chang our mind set think differ about problem becaus we ar the on who have to solv the econom problem cruz what also happen is we will have to seek wai chang thought i want to know if thi ha been discuss as thi viewer comment if the measur ar anti popular what is the state go to do ross what ar we all go to do i do not believ that the measur need to be applaud thei entail an amount of sacrific but ar aim precis at protect the peopl at protect our accomplish i ask thi question in pinar del rio and repeat it at la corona do we close the hermano ameijeira clinic surgic hospit if we do not solv thi we have to close the hospit do you want it to close thi wa follow by everyon s spontan protest to the contrari i ask do we close half the school in cuba what is happen in the rest of the contin and the world we have a special situat have a blockad which make our situat more difficult pantoja retire ar conduct a strike in panama right now ross there ar crise in everi countri and the solut be implement ar truli anti popular becaus in those countri the rich do not stop be rich on the contrari the peopl becom poorer here we share the poverti among all of us cruz except the profit ross except the profit yet there wa a worker at the tobacco factori who told comrad alarcon you who repres the state ar requir to take drastic measur against the profit we demand thi we ar go to solv our problem but you have to solv that problem the peopl the worker ar alreadi demand thi a young tobacco worker said there why i who spend eight hour make tobacco when i get to the corner just outsid the factori i meet other youth like me sell pullov and shoe barter and have drink that ar imposs to find anywher exhibit the result of the profit of the theft of the black market cruz thi also ha to do with someth in pacheco said in her letter we have to analyz everyth in depth becaus we need to take a packag of measur we have to attack the problem from mani differ angl ross ye it ha to be a packag of measur we ar hear propos about divers measur but not all measur will be adopt cruz of cours ross from that pool of measur we will have we will adopt the most viabl and clever on fidel said the most clever the least like to hurt our peopl everyth we ar do we ar do to solv the dire problem our peopl confront todai cruz thi comrad in her letter wrote about on of these problem she said regard our commentari last saturdai 15 januari about the lack of servic worker in hospit and other place that someon get more monei by simpli sell hi quota of rum coffe and cigarett than by work 30 dai and he doe thi without have to work if the profit wa unabl to profit that person would be forc to get an avail job thi includ peopl without a job as well as retire who want to improv their incom ross think such as thi teach us a lot about what need to be done pantoja although profit ar prepar for these measur about the monei and ar invest in properti bui thi and that ross properti also can be confisc properti bought with ill gotten monei can be confisc cruz thi is precis on the question we receiv how can we tell monei is properli or improperli obtain do you also get thi question pantoja no there ar other question ross our peopl know everyon know who is who cruz that is right we all know in our block who is who we know who got a car and new cloth overnight and doe not have a rel send dollar pantoja i have here a listen ruben jeronimo rodriguez 501 25th street between h and i in vedado he propos as part of thi econom effici struggl an analysi of the possibl of make work center manag a person nomin and elect by that work center s worker someth similar to what is be done in the basic cooper product unit ubpc in the ubpc the state bodi make a propos but if the member disagre thei can nomin a ubpc worker and he becom the manag in other word a nomin is present to the ubpc but if the worker disagre thei select anoth person ross thi is the nomin of a member to the ubpc pantoja ruben jeronimo rodriguez propos that thi also be done in the work center ross in the work center we alreadi have manag the worker also have the right to remov a manag who doe not make the best us of resourc thi is a right all cuban worker have but we do not exercis it thi is a matter in which our union have been lack have not act have not exercis that right whether or not to elect them is not what provid the appropri person there is a select process for state enterpris manag a select process take place now if the person doe not perform appropri the work center alwai alwai repeat ha the mean to challeng thi and demand that he be remov it is necessari that where the absurd exist where there is profit and two hand theft chang thought in a small work center particularli where theft keep everyon on the verg of bare make it everyon know who the thiev ar the manag must be the first to know and if he is not capabl of figur it out then he doe not deserv to be the manag cruz you have made refer to thi mani time in the past few dai there is the question of what role the union must plai in thi situat what is happen we have live for 35 year in a world where the revolut is all of us and each of us howev not everyon s function have been clearli establish dure thi process yet the societi ha made progress through divers mean nowadai we have a major of good revolutionari peopl but thi crisi ha also expos the spiritu poverti of mani the difficulti of the peopl requir a precis appropri balanc i believ it is time for the union chang thought as you mention where there is a problem the worker ar fulli entitl to express themselv pantoja i have here a question by jesu fernandez beltran consulado street 111 havana citi he ask doe the upgrad of an enterpris s categori increas the salari of the cadr but not of the worker is there ani offici word on thi can thi be done now ross there ar certain entiti where salari increas for worker and manag have been implement particularli for worker there wa a major salari increas throughout the tourism sector in joint enterpris the personnel roster have been adjust more is therefor requir of the worker in term of workload as well as in level of profession we have state that as more is demand of the worker there must also be a salari respons the life of the nation doe not stop when confront with a situat such as thi while we ar correct thing over here we ar also make progress on the other side where we can we must acceler progress there where it is need i do not know what specif case he is refer to the goal now is to adjust to free the economi and servic from the heavi ballast of bloat personnel roster in the product sector as well as in administr thi cannot be done hastili it must be studi we must clearli explain the entir ration process i answer a question on the open agenda program that thi must be accompani by activ union participaton thi will alwai be done with individu in mind those stai and those who must reloc particularli those who must reloc becaus thei ar the on who face the greatest conflict cruz i am concern by someth that i know also worri mani peopl becaus i have discuss thi with friend and listen i am veri afraid that under thi premis of protect the worker and the peopl we will continu promot patern thi worri me a great deal becaus i alreadi know mani cun peopl who ar sai i can bypass that no problem thi worri me becaus i believ that we have to at least onc in thi societi ensur that good thing ar for those who realli work and contribut to societi thi is why i support help peopl rather than subsid product and activ thi is why i believ peopl should be subsid if your incom is veri low and you have to do certain thing you can be given a special card thi is done in all countri of the world even the capitalist countri you pai less for transport and so forth but the other price ar high there ar mani who think that becaus our peopl ar so fine the revolut so good that those who do not work who do not make an effort to get a job will continu to live off those who do ross soledad it is go to be veri difficult to ignor our humanitarian paternalist natur what we can do is ensur social justic in a trabajador editori we said that our commit is to the good worker the worker who doe hi job the worker who fulfil hi social duti we have no commit to slacker i therefor believ that what you sai is fair the good worker and the peopl do not believ that the revolut will abandon anyon but we must rememb that the revolut is the peopl the peopl who work the patriot peopl cruz i have here three question that have to do with the state perhap you have question as well pantoja similar question and differ question cruz the peopl have been somewhat shock by what thei heard about the profit of the enterpris the budget the budget deficit the enterpris that contribut to the deficit pantoja sixti on percent of the enterpris cruz that is correct the peopl ar demand that the state set an exampl and i believ the peopl ar right in make thi demand the peopl have ask the follow question will the worker be told how much foreign exchang the enterpris us up ross thei must be told cruz how doe the govern plan to save monei ha the govern decid on the measur to be implement or is it wait for the peopl to express their opinion ross no measur have been draft all possibl measur ar be studi comrad fidel said quit rightli that no matter how good a technic measur mai be if it is not understood and support by the worker it cannot be implement on the other hand the worker themselv ar quit capabl of come up with wai to solv the problem wai that not even the academician can think of i will give you an exampl and you will see that it is the same as on of those suggest you jot down in your notepad at the cigar factori worker suggest that instead of give the worker dai off for ill that ten dai a year be set asid for sick leav pantoja jose miguel quinonez mato of el vedado ha suggest 10 dai a year ross that

hi sick leav he be paid for those dai at the end of the year that is a suggest i am not sai that it must be implement but it doe sound interest i do not think the academ had thought about that pantoja thi also give you an idea of how the worker ar search for wai to save and to put an end to patern mani of the worker get medic certif to cover up mani of these thing the health congress discuss ross interrupt soledad wa just talk about what la corona worker had suggest if a person get sick and is go to be out for more than the 10 dai he can take sick leav then he will be cover by social secur it

FBIS4-10443: cso editori regard price subsidi and econom effici text the peopl s debat on effici and improv domest financ will be over in just about a week now we can talk without fear of error of an ampl number of propos on which cuban worker have reach consensu some of these propos concern price adjust for specif product like cigar and rum thei ar primarili relat to basic commod for which coupon book ar us for purchas for cigar the formula propos have two basic variant on favor elimin all quota with the unrestrict sale of thi product at a new price and anoth advoc elimin the addit quota 1 60 and keep cigar price unrestrict for rum the major of the peopl who express an opinion in the peopl s parliament felt the price should be increas and it should be offer onli on free sale these two item which ar not necess no matter how much mani peopl do need them have the potenti to attract foreign currenc in an amount that could reach 4 billion peso a year if cuba were to ensur a suffici product of both item so thei could be sold without restrict for essenti good which ar now subsid the worker meet frequent suggest new price that would at least cover product cost at the present time the subsidi includ in these price mai be calcul at about 400 million peso a year the 1993 budget deficit wa 10 time larger thi mean that financi speak the contribut that cigar and rum could make toward a healthi budget is much greater the price adjust for essenti good assum that it were appli to all subsid item would not be decis though it would make a signific contribut at thi point it is wise to emphas on point in order to avoid misinterpret of what we ar sai consensu doe not mean unanim and consensu approv doe not mean there is no dissent on thi or that aspect of a given issu thi is also the right time to sai that the exist of popular consensu on a broad group of possibl measur doe not mean thei will definit be appli immedi it is the respons of the peopl s govern nation assembl and of other high level govern bodi to decid which ar the most appropri and possibl measur with what dynam and intens thei should be appli and how thei should be implement so that thei will have an impact on the economi in a harmoni and interrel manner so thei will becom part of the system and not enter the financi univers in isol but whether or not all the measur the worker have recommend on price ar adopt immedi is not the most import thing the essenti is that the problem of price is begin to becom a part of our nation econom awar for year partli becaus of lack of foresight and partli becaus the cuban economi wa integr in an intern trade system that wa essenti fair and certain the problem of price both domest and foreign price wa someth that did not concern the popul just rememb the price of sugar in what wa call the world market an issu that had earlier obsess our grandpar wa bare of interest to specialist for domest price it wa often true that we consum paid for product without even bother to find out the unit price of the item we were bui now we ar begin to realiz that we have to pai much more attent to econom law if we ar go to keep our economi a socialist economi and we can understand that price ar a lead instrument for restructur our economi that ha been forc by circumst to becom a part of an extern world that is absolut driven by market law no matter what measur mai emerg from the next session of the peopl s govern nation assembl it is extrem import for peopl to understand that when thei bui a pound of black bean at the retail price it cost the state 50 centavo while the consum bui it for 30 someth similar take place with almost all grain dairi and meat product coffe bread fuel and other item of 30 essenti household item over 20 ar subsid by the state here we ar speak of merchandis whose real cost could be estim in freeli convert currenc as these item ar mostli acquir abroad in thi world of price both the price paid by the popul and those us in the busi economi we need to becom more awar and realiz that everyth we consum everyth we see around us that is produc by labor in the end ha a specif cost in convert currenc thi will forc us to make a much greater effort to increas the correl between real cost and price while not overlook the fact that in the futur it will be virtual imposs to keep price immobil which wa the normal practic dure the last three decad but thi doe not mean we ar advoc that thi correl in retail price should be reach suddenli and automat price paid by the peopl in our socialist societi will alwai be a mean us to promot the just and equit distribut of social product thi is not to be confus with egalitarian the worker ar ask that peopl whose incom ar too low for them to pai the regular price be subsid in order to avoid have the state subsid everyon in an egalitarian system paradox subsid price benefit both the monei hoarder and the retire and both the idler and the model worker the worker want thi to come to an end thei know thi is a process thei know it will take time thei agre that sacrific will have to be made but thei have confid that in price as well as in other area we will achiev ration and effici
