FBIS3-41744: languag russian articl type cso articl by leonid repin comment under the titl ra viru with yellow ey you haven t heard of thi diseas but by the wai more than 10 million russian ar infect with it text two type of hepat b and c bear frankli mortal danger for man have been grow here into an enorm problem accord to the calcul of specialist more than 10 million russian ar infect with hepat c and it can be suppos in fact no on know thi precis mani more ar infect with hepat b it is the agent of thi diseas in particular that is more widespread than of all the other hepat and it is into the bargain more danger it is follow hepat b in particular that cancer frequent develop to an even greater degre than from hepat c if on look at the problem from opposit perspect it turn out that the viru of hepat c is found in nineti per cent of patient with cirrhosi and cancer of the liver the situat is complic by the fact that the major of oncolog patient ar also treat among other method by mean of the scalpel and ar transfus with donat blood and that no on can state with certainti that ill fate hepat is not introduc into these patient with thi blood becaus here we do not carri out such investig if that is the case and most like it is the case then frequent oper oncolog patient die not of the cancer but of subsequ complic like acut hepat insuffici but after all that s how matter turn it s not accident howev that hepat c in particular is more and more often call the plagu of the twentieth centuri not aid but thi curs hepat of our the american were the first to becom alarm and to take up the struggl against hepat c in a concert manner thei develop and began to produc diagnost prepar to identifi case of hepat c it wa thei who carri out the first mass survei the result prove stagger 85 per cent of patient with chronic hepat had acquir the ubiquit viru follow blood transfus the problem in our countri ha becom especi acut about 22 million dose of blood were given in the last year of the exist of the ussr that mean that there should have been an equal number of analys even if it is assum that on analysi cost a dollar while in fact is it is more expens it is not difficult to imagin how much such analys for the hepat c content would cost understand we did not do such analys and inde thei ar not done now i donut know perhap thei ar in special except case but it is necessari to do them if for no other reason than otherwis the consequ will be unpredict peopl who by the veri charact of their work know the natur of the hepat viru transmit with blood ar ring the alarm attempt to attract attent to the mortal danger lurk in the shadow of mani other problem oncologist professor g a tkacheva analyz the pathwai along which the hepat c viru reach the organ of healthi peopl conclud about 60 million peopl pass through russia s medic hospit a year peopl who is oper on and transfus with blood ar treat conserv but thei must all be administ drug intraven and that is the path of infect all els asid the troubl li in the fact that even the acut form of hepat veri often progress with weakli manifest symptom and therefor mani case remain total unrecogn someon is sick and grave sick and no on know why thi alarm situat is aggrav also by the fact that thi viru is transmit not onli through everi possibl medic manipul but by sexual intimaci as well like the aid viru and even through the most ordinari social contact between peopl so you see the kind of disast so is there no rescu specialist believ that a nation program of unreserv examin of donor blood and of all blood go into the prepar of everi possibl type of pharmaceut of all patient subject to contact with needl and scalpel of all pregnant women and all children is the onli wai the chameleon viru can be conquer it stand to reason the creation of the domest manufactur of diagnost prepar must be provid for in thi program otherwis after all we ar prefer to pai insan amount of monei to foreign firm for readi made prepar and ar therefor condemn to bui them into the futur instead of organ our own product my old good friend correspond member of the russian academi of scienc professor m s balayan who ha been deal with the hepat all hi life and ha carri out an extrem danger experi on himself nevertheless confid to me with a smile perhap we shouldn t panic although of cours all that is so all that is correct the danger is great just consid the fact that in the last ten year about fifteen previous unknown infect have come to light it is normal that thei come to light what is abnorm is that we begin to combat them late

the potabl water system and convers onc legionella spp ar cultur from the water case of nosocomi legionellosi mai occur 383 389 propon of thi strategi indic that when physician ar inform that the

cultur a limit number of water sampl if the test is done infrequ compar with the cost of routin laboratori diagnost test for legionellosi in all patient with nosocomi pneumonia in hospit that have had no case of nosocomi legionellosi the main argument against thi approach is that in the absenc of case the relationship between the result of water cultur and the risk of legionellosi remain undefin

interpret of the result of routin cultur of water mai be confound by variabl cultur result among site sampl within a singl water system and by fluctuat in the concentr of legionella spp in the same

gener pneumonia is well understood by doctor and is easili treat with a varieti of antibiot said dr bisher akil an expert in infecti diseas and pulmonari medicin at the univers of southern california you get simpl outpati treatment with antibiot and you get over it akil said in healthi peopl it s not a problem unless you ignor it and let it escal but pneumonia is fatal for an estim 70 000 american each year rank as the sixth lead caus of death accord to the american lung assn most of the death occur among the elderli infant and peopl with ill such as cancer or diabet all of whom have weak immun system and mai be unabl to fight off infect in other case death can occur if treatment begin too late as wa appar the case with henson or becaus the particular strain of pneumonia is difficult to identifi as in the case of actress elizabeth taylor s brush with death from pneumonia last month expert said pneumonia is an infect of lung tissu and is classifi accord to it caus and it locat in the lung akil said the diseas is most commonli caus by bacteria such as the streptococcu bacteria that kill henson it is also caus by viral infect such as influenza in rarer instanc pneumonia is caus by fungi parasit chemic agent or allerg reaction to foreign particl that lodg in the lung streptococcu a bacterium found in the mouth is the lead caus of pneumonia and is fatal in about 5 of case usual in peopl with weaken immun system expert said henson appar di from a strain call group a streptococcu which offici at the center for diseas control in atlanta said is increas in frequenc for reason

symptom of pneumonia he did not have a fever or sputum he did have a mild cough symptom of pneumonia can vari accord to it type four major symptom common to streptococcu ar fever chest pain cough and short of breath akil said bacteri pneumonia is usual accompani by a discharg of sputum sometim blood ting from the lung viral pneumonia often produc a dry cough pneumonia commonli trigger a particular kind of chill a sever trembl of the bodi call a rigor said dr elli goldstein chief of infecti diseas at st john s hospit and health center in santa monica where taylor is recov from the autopsi and

bodi to mount it own natur defens said goldstein thu the serious of the ill vari accord to the strength of an individu s defens if the agent caus the pneumonia can be identifi the particular antibiot that will be most effect is prescrib akil said if a caus is not immedi appar doctor must try variou drug and perform laboratori test of lung sputum or lung tissu with viral pneumonia which mai not produc sputum from the lung that can be us to identifi the viru doctor sometim remov a piec of lung tissu to test to make a diagnosi the problem with viral pneumonia is that our abil to identifi the viru is not good akil said most of the time the diagnosi is on of exclus but what happen with elizabeth taylor is that thei had to go with open lung biopsi becaus thei couldn t find a reason thei had to take a big piec of lung tissu and look at it taylor 58 wa near death with viral pneumonia when doctor perform a lung biopsi to identifi which antibiot would best assist her antivir drug have been develop that ar effect in treat some viral pneumonia taylor enter daniel freeman marina hospit april 10 with a sinu infect the infect progress to pneumonia and the actress wa transfer to st john s april 16 taylor s pneumonia most like develop from a viru in her bloodstream but peopl can get pneumonia from differ kind of exposur akil said on is when you swallow saliva and normal bacteria and it doesn t go to the stomach it goe to the lung he said we do that all time as long as our immun system is intact it take care of the bacteria we accid inhal into our lung onc the immun system is weaken whamo you get pneumonia the diseas can also enter the bloodstream from a cut for exampl and can travel to the lung or the offend agent can be inhal as wa the case with legionnair s diseas which is caus by legionella bacteria and spread through the air usual from a contamin air condit system or water system legionella bacteria were recogn as a caus of pneumonia after 29 peopl di after an
