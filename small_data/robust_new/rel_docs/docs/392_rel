small part such as those found in electron to weld and open hole in larg part such as those found in aircraft and automobil bodi recent yag laser have been us to weld aluminum alloi which had been consid nearli imposs to weld and thei ar now begin to appear on mass product line moreov there ar now instanc in which yag laser have been put to practic us not onli to weld and drill hole but also to modifi the surfac of materi the sale of yag laser manufactur equip grew steadili from about 1200 unit in 1989 to about 1450 unit in 1990 sup 1 in 1991 howev invest in equip began to drop and sale level off then in 1992 sale decreas to about 1300 unit although unit sale have fallen off we can sai that us for yag laser industri equip ar expand becaus that is the gener feel among manufactur and user of yag laser process equip when we look at a rough breakdown of yag laser equip sold welder and marker compris about 30 each and the remain 40 is made up of trimmer cutoff machin and hole drill machin the us of yag laser equip ar expand in the field of weld and drill auto electr industri look to yag for more precis more compact product there is current a strong move in the auto industri toward lightweight bodi on effect mean for make auto lighter is to us aluminum howev aluminum ha a high reflect ratio and high heat conduct so it ha been consid unsuit for laser process howev becaus the averag output and function of yag laser have improv yag laser can now be us to weld aluminum alloi and thei have start to appear on mass product line in the electr electron manufactur and precis instrument field where compact and light weight have alreadi made great advanc yag laser ar often us to make precis spot weld the demand is grow stronger for high precis process as the number of small part increas noboru taguchi chief of engin laser equip oper nec sai as part becom smaller and more precis the valu of us yag laser will becom even greater the user of yag laser share the same view figur 1 show a printer head spot weld with a yag laser at tosei electrobeam main offic mizuho cho tokyo a major job shop that doe the process for the manufactur mamoru ueno presid tosei electrobeam

modif of materi surfac in the futur thei will sure be note as a method for ad new function to materi surfac thu the us of yag laser process ha expand into mani area that is becaus there is grow recognit of the special featur and excel of yag laser for process part and product that requir high precis compact etc see box materi p 16 yag laser process is expand it rang in weld and hole drill and at the same time open new territori in the field of surfac modif weld aluminum is a difficult materi to weld becaus of it high reflect ratio moreov it ha 4 5 time the heat conduct of iron so ani absorb heat immedi dissip make local heat veri difficult laser beam with veri high output ar effect in overcom these problem therefor when we consid the weld of aluminum from the standpoint of output there is a good argument at thi point for us co sup 2 laser which can gener even higher output than yag laser howev the yag laser is a tool that is hard to give up on sup 2 first of all there is a gener trend for reflect ratio in metal to decreas as the wavelength of the light grow shorter therefor yag laser which emit light at a wavelength of 1 06 m have an advantag over co sup 2 laser with longer their wavelength of 10 6 m in the case of aluminum the reflect ratio for a co sup 2 laser is a high 96 but is 80 for a yag laser or look at thi in term of the rate of absorpt onli 4 of co sup 2 laser light is absorb compar with 20 of yag laser light moreov the output waveform emit by yag laser can be vari and thi can be us to control the amount of heat gain to the materi by us thi featur it is possibl to improv the weld of metal surfac with high reflect ratio such as aluminum alloi and copper and mirror like materi with smooth surfac although the continu emiss output of co sup 2 laser is greater than that of yag laser yag laser ar superior to co sup 2 laser becaus thei can gener a peak output of sever ten of kilowatt instantan by puls emiss for these reason research both by manufactur and user on aluminum alloi weld by yag laser ha advanc along with the develop of high output yag laser see box materi p 18 first applic of aluminum alloi weld auto hood product line as all thi research on aluminum alloi weld proceed the mazda motor corpor jump ahead of the competit and becam the first compani to make a practic applic of yag laser for aluminum alloi weld mazda instal yag

unit each fig 2 not reproduc the auto industri is strive to us more aluminum part to increas fuel effici the present condit howev is that the high reflect and heat conduct ratio of aluminum have hinder progress so much that adopt aluminum part ha been reduc mostli to lip servic mazda howev move aggress to us aluminum for bodi part such as choos to us an aluminum hood on it rx 7 for export to the us in 1985 as far as the weight of the bodi is concern the hood is particularli import therefor mazda chose the hood as on of it target for reduc the weight of the bodi and manag to cut the weight of the hood to 10 kg roughli half the weight of previou steel hood by switch to aluminum in it efini rx 7 that went on sale domest in decemb 1991 for exampl befor mazda introduc yag laser in mai 1992 it assembl aluminum hood with mig weld howev becaus the mig weld wa perform by hand there wa a small amount of variat depend on which employe did the weld and there wa a tendenc for uneven to appear in place where the surfac of the hood wa weld moreov even when the same employe did the weld it wa difficult to maintain consist in all the weld locat therefor to improv the appear it wa necessari to introduc a polish step after the weld to smooth down the surfac of the hood sever micromet the polish oper gener dust which degrad the work environ and creat anoth problem to overcom these problem mazda introduc yag laser by combin optic fiber and robot technolog to autom the weld process and elimin the dust yag laser to be us in futur to reduc weld defect by control of output waveform the maximum averag output of these yag laser is 800 w but the maximum peak output is 10 kw the laser is combin with on robot and 10 meter of optic fiber fig 3 weld us a puls laser beam the time requir to weld on hood includ the time to transport the part and the time us for the movement of the robot arm is about 1 minut 50 second the hood consist of two sheet of 1 mm thick 5000 seri al mg seri aluminum alloi weld togeth fig 4 the perimet of the outer metal sheet is fold over so that it enclos the inner sheet if we look at a cross section of the edg of the hood it appear to be construct from three sheet of metal what is weld by yag laser is the perimet consist of three sheet fold over each other 15 locat on the rx 7 and 18 on the sentia the depth of penetr at each weld is about 1 3 1 4 mm and the length of each weld is about 20 mm dure trial weld defect such as crack and pinhol occur in the aluminum alloi becaus of rapid cool after exposur to the laser beam howev chinobu iwashita manag 2nd bodi engin group mazda engin divis explain we reduc the number of weld defect by accur control of the waveform gener by the laser on strength of yag laser is the fact that heat gain can be control by control the output waveform mr iwashita continu we want to aggress emploi yag laser with the goal of us aluminum alloi for part other than the hood such as the trunk and door mazda also plan to studi us yag laser to weld metal other than aluminum alloi such as iron and zinc galvan steel sheet new type of motorcycl exhaust chamber requir lighter weight and greater precis the yamaha motor compani with the cooper of sakura industri main offic hamamatsu citi shizuoka prefectur introduc yag laser for the assembl of the collect portion exhaust chamber of the exhaust pipe which is part of their motorcycl muffler sup 3 the exhaust chamber yamaha is assembl with yag laser ha a brand new construct and it is mount on the sport model fzr400 and fzr250 fig 5 not reproduc with high rpm engin some part of engin perform fall off as the engin s speed increas thi phenomenon occur becaus there is a long period of overlap in which both intak and exhaust valv ar open when the overlap period is long it is hard for the fuel mixtur to enter the cylind if the exhaust valv is open becaus the exhaust is under posit pressur as the fuel mixtur tri to enter the cylind thi is becaus the exhaust is reflect by the chamber and silenc and the pressur wave rebound into the cylind interfer with the fuel mixtur s enter the cylind as a result combust falter and engin perform drop therefor yamaha develop a new type of exhaust chamber that can control the exhaust ga pressur a taper rotat valv open and shut and thi design control the pressur of the exhaust ga from idl through high speed fig 6 becaus the chamber is the area where the exhaust ga converg it get veri hot and vibrat sever so it must have great strength it must also be veri precis thi is especi import for the taper part of the chamber where the valv slide if the radial precis is poor in thi area there is a chanc that the valv will stick and fail to function properli dure initi develop yamaha us a cast stainless steel chamber that had been machin process howev naohisa takahashi materi research manag 2nd research depart yamaha engin headquart said we found it difficult to process the taper area with good precis and maintain thin wall for light weight there were also problem becaus the cast and process cost were high weld 4 pipe into singl unit altern us 2 optic fiber therefor yamaha adopt a manufactur method in which thei stamp a 1 2mm thick stainless steel sheet into a bodi and four pipe and then weld these togeth to form the chamber the yag laser is us to weld these four independ pipe into a singl unit fig 7 yamaha chose a yag laser becaus it wa easi to add to the product line and it weld have few distort the yag laser us by yamaha is in the 400 w output class and it us two optic fiber 2 meter long on optic fiber is us for weld the top and bottom of the chamber and the other is us for weld the taper area the laser beam is switch between the two and the two optic fiber ar us on after the other the weld sequenc is as follow first the taper area of the four pipe ar align and set in a jig then the top is weld in three locat by a puls laser beam from the optic fiber for weld the top and bottom face fig 8 the puls laser beam overlap the bead to complet the weld next the workpiec is turn over and the bottom face is weld in three locat in the same manner final the laser beam is switch over to the optic fiber for weld the taper area and it weld the taper area dure thi process if the weld speed is too fast the bead fail to overlap and gap form between them if a chamber is mount on a bike in thi condit air will leak into the taper area through these gap while the bike is run caus afterburn thi produc loud nois and in sever case break the muffler therefor it is danger to perform the weld too quickli on the other hand when it is imposs to instal a lot of laser equip from the cost standpoint it is necessari to speed up the weld time as much as possibl to increas product capac take these factor into consider yamaha chose a weld speed of 3 5 mm sec by instal the yag laser yamaha wa abl to make the chamber 40 lighter than the origin cast chamber and to cut process cost by 30 as well yamaha is plan to us yag laser for weld other part in the futur yag laser us to make heat sensor by weld thin stainless steel sheet to iron there ar more and more case where yag laser ar us in the manufactur of electron instrument part matsushita electr work is make activ us of yag laser in it manufactur process in a number of wai on of these is a heat detector that is us to detect fire etc the heat sensor consist of a stainless steel diaphragm 20 m thick and a heat sens iron plate 200 m thick fig 9 the yag laser is us to weld the diaphragm to the heat sens plate and the weld area extend around the perimet of the diaphragm diaphragm on previou heat sensor were made of copper base materi and were attach to the heat sens plate by solder howev copper base materi corrod easili and there were question about reliabl to overcom thi problem matsushita chose to us stainless steel as a diaphragm materi stainless steel howev cannot be solder moreov becaus the stainless steel sheet us as a diaphragm is veri thin accord to yoshimitsu nakamura chief engin matsushita electr work product engin research institut it will becom uncontrol distort if a larg amount of heat is convei to the surround area when it is attach to the heat sens plate therefor matsushita instal a puls excit yag laser that enabl local heat to weld the stainless steel sheet the time requir to weld on diaphragm is about 5 second there is anoth area where matsushita us the yag laser in addit to thi weld the detector must oper faithfulli in case of fire but it must not be activ by the gradual rise temperatur of midsumm therefor a small hole is open in the flang so that the flang expand onli when the temperatur rise rapidli when the temperatur rise slowli air escap from the hole and the flang doe not expand on the other hand the air insid the detector expand all at onc in a fire so even if some air escap through the hole the flang will expand and the detector will work thi is an extrem small hole with a diamet of 22 m which is bare visibl to the nake ey matsushita us the yag laser to drill thi hole yag laser built into press to weld thin lamin sheet the magnet head core us in audio equip is a part consist of sever thin layer sheet the thinner the sheet the better the frequenc properti etc so step ar be taken to make these sheet thinner kuroda precis industri develop the laser fastec system which stamp out thin sheet about 0 1 mm thick form them into layer and weld the layer togeth with a yag laser to make the singl unit kuroda began to us thi system in the mass product of magnet head core in 1992 fig 10 sup 4 the compani origin had a die system call the fastec system thi system perform the function of stamp out the thin sheet on a press and arrang them into layer the method of join the layer sheet on thi system wa to emboss the sheet and caulk them howev the sheet becam so thin that it wa no longer possibl to add emboss on the press to form emboss on a thin sheet the press must be control to micromet precis accord to nobuaki iguchi head of develop kuroda precis industri either you get no dimpl or the press punch through the sheet and open a hole if thi precis control is not possibl moreov the number of small part that cannot accommod emboss ha increas therefor kuroda build a yag laser into the fastec system and develop the laser fastec system that weld the sheet togeth instead of caulk them the thin sheet cut by the press ar stack on after the other and as each thin sheet is ad it is weld in place by the laser built into the die the laser beam is convei into the die by a maximum of 8 optic fiber and it can weld 8 spot at the same time the gener of the laser beam is synchron with the movement of the die so that it fire when the move platen of the die is rais the optic fiber us in thi system ar 5 meter long there is a lot of vibrat around the system becaus of the stamp oper but becaus the laser gener is locat a short distanc awai it is not affect much by the vibrat further di requir routin mainten such as remov dust and the di ar often chang these oper becom difficult if the structur of the line is complex howev a spokesman for kuroda precis industri emphas the addit merit of the yag laser system by sai becaus thi system us optic fiber the line is not complex and these oper ar not difficult to perform drill hole in addit to weld yag laser ar us extens to drill hole thi cover a wide rang of product such as automobil aircraft home applianc etc and the hole vari wide both in size and shape laser us to drill varieti of hole in auto bodi reduc number of di and amount of inventori there ar case in which the chang from past process method to yag laser process ha result in great advantag on exampl come from the toyota motor corpor toyota instal a yag laser system to drill hole in exterior bodi panel and it began oper in june 1990 fig 11 not reproduc in the past toyota stamp out the hole on press but switch to us yag laser to reduc the number of di and the amount of inventori toyota us a yag laser with a maximum averag output of 200 w but the hole ar drill with a puls laser beam the bodi panel ar zinc galvan steel 0 8 1 0 mm thick the hole drill by laser ar for attach the licens plate instal antenna etc and thei includ a varieti of shape such as round squar and oblong and a size rang of 4 20 mm in diamet about 15 hole per vehicl ar drill by laser on ten model such as the vista corolla and hi lux yag laser ar instal on all six product line in four plant such as those at takaoka and tsutsumi the model thei manufactur have variou specif on exampl is the steer column specif depend on whether the car is a right hand or left hand drive the hole for the steer column must be open on either the right or left side of the dashboard panel to respond to these variou specif it is necessari to instal the yag laser on both side of the line therefor three of the six line have onli on yag laser unit and the other three line have two there is on robot for each laser gener the hole drill at toyota is not mere a matter of open a small hole by melt and evapor the materi some hole ar cut out by move the laser beam thi gener scrap as a result masao kawas engin control depart 2nd product engin divis toyota motor corpor said get rid of thi scrap materi present a problem to keep the scrap from fall a magnet wa attach to the tip of the robot arm the magnet directli pick up the scrap gener after the hole is open and remov it from the line the robot throw awai a piec of scrap materi each time a hole is open dure thi process sensor locat outsid the line check each time to make sure that the robot ha actual remov the piec of scrap in the past bodi panel hole were open by stamp but there were two problem on wa that a differ die wa need for each model and it specif as a result it wa necessari to build a lot more di to correspond to the increas in model number anoth problem wa inventori among product process open hole is a rel fast oper onc the hole have been made the specif for that bodi panel ar set therefor it wa necessari to keep a larg inventori for each differ specif to cut down on inventori it wa necessari to shift the hole open process which set the specif as far down the product line as possibl with yag laser process no di ar need moreov it is possibl to place the hole open process near the end of the product line which provid process flexibl sinc the hole can be drill in respons to the specif need at that time toyota plan to try yag laser in the process of aluminum alloi materi in the futur yag laser drill 630 cool hole in ga turbin blade yag laser were instal at the takasago plant of mitsubishi heavi industri which manufactur industri ga turbin in februari 1991 to drill cool hole in turbin blade and thei went on line in april 1991 sup 5 the materi us in the turbin blade is a heat resist cobalt base alloi the yag laser have an maximum averag output of 230 240 w and a maximum peak output of 20 kw user desir high ga temperatur at the turbin inlet in order to increas turbin effici and in the case of high effici turbin the temperatur mai reach a maximum of 1350 c natur the harshest condit fall on the first level of stationari blade locat closest to the hot inlet gase therefor mitsubishi is drill a larg number of hole in the stationari blade to keep the temperatur at their surfac cooler fig 12 not reproduc compress air flow through the insid of blade and erupt through the hole to cover it surfac and form a kind of protect barrier thi air cool not onli lower the surfac temperatur of the stationari blade to 750 800 c but also extend blade life the number of hole the yag laser drill in the stationari blade depend on the type of ga turbin in type where the inlet temperatur reach 1250 c about 150 hole ar need and in type where the temperatur reach 1350 c about 630 hole ar need in the case of the 1350 c type the laser drill about 200 cool hole in the stationari blade for the second row as well the hole diamet rang from about 1 0 2 5 mm and the part of the blade where the hole ar drill rang from 3 7 mm thick these hole ar not alwai perpendicular to the surfac and sometim fall at about 30 45 angl hole drill at these angl ar sometim more than 10 mm long the spot of the laser beam is onli about 0 5 mm in diamet much smaller than the hole therefor first the laser beam drill straight through and then is move in a circular motion to widen the hole by melt and evapor the workpiec materi a protect plate is insert into the blade to protect area outsid the process site from laser beam damag in the past these cool hole were drill by electr discharg process equip at the takasago plant thi method wa not effici howev becaus it requir chang jig and electrod to accommod hole of differ angl and locat earli in 1991 there wa an upsurg in turbin order and mitsubishi had to find a more effici wai to produc them thei chose to instal yag laser becaus of their high process capabl hiroyuki fukunishi blade section manag takasago plant manufactur depart mitsubishi heavi industri sai we increas our process effici from 4 to 10 time by instal yag laser while maintain precis equal to that of electr discharg process moreov yag laser can be us on ceram coat stationari blade which cannot be process by electr discharg becaus of conduct problem the takasago plant plan to instal anoth yag laser unit thi summer and will try to us yag laser for move blade as well in the futur yag laser also us for high precis aircraft turbin for exactli the same reason cool hole ar drill in the turbin blade of jet engin for aircraft japan turbin technolog main offic daiei town chiba prefectur began us yag laser in 1991 for the repair and process of cool hole in turbin stationari blade for jet engin sup 6 thi compani wa establish in 1988 as a joint ventur between japan air line and nippon steel mainli for the purpos of repair jet engin turbin of larg commerci aircraft the high pressur turbin in larg jet engin oper in combust gase at temperatur exceed 1300 c and pressur exceed 2 5 mpa 25 atmospher and at the high speed of about 9000 rpm becaus the turbin blade ar oper under such harsh condit thei ar repair after everi 10 000 hour of fly time repair is perform on each blade after it is remov from the engin fig 13 not reproduc dure repair the cool hole get plug becaus of retouch perform on the whole surfac of the blade such as braze over area where crack have form the compani us yag laser to reopen the plug hole the yag laser us by japan turbin technolog ha a maximum averag output of 400 w and a maximum peak output of 20 kw the thick at the area where the hole ar open in the stationari blade is about 2 mm but just as in the case of the ga turbin mani hole lie at an angl to the surfac and some lie at an angl of onli 6 with respect to the surfac the hole diamet ar about 0 5 0 6 mm and number 550 560 on each blade the number of cool hole is greater for engin of higher output just like mitsubishi heavi industri japan turbin technolog us a method so that the laser beam will not damag other part of the blade when it open the hole high precis is requir to control the flow volum of cool air in jet engin turbin blade even a small error will badli affect effici and lead to blade damag therefor the hole shape and surfac smooth must be control with high precis process yoshimichi moroi engin section manag engin depart japan turbin technolog sai the most import factor is to find optim condit that hold the heat effect to a minimum dure process trim rotor surfac on motor to achiev dynam balanc all the hole process we have discuss thu far ha involv open hole all the wai through materi howev there is also process that involv trim awai small area and make indent hair dryer have a compact motor that revolv at a high speed of 10 000 20 000 rpm therefor it is necessari to achiev dynam balanc in the rotor just as the tire on an auto need to be balanc poor dynam balanc result in vibrat nois and shorten lifetim in the past a drill wa us to trim place that disrupt the balanc howev that method wa not effici becaus each time the rotor wa trim it had to be check to see whether it wa in balanc or not therefor matsushita electr work instal a yag laser to improv product effici figur 14 show the product line where dynam balanc is achiev with the yag laser the rotor that arriv ar first mount on a measur devic call a balanc and spun at 1500 rpm dure thi process the balanc base will begin to vibrat if the rotor is out of balanc sensor mount on the balanc detect the locat and amount of imbal after the amount of imbal and their locat ar specif determin the rotor is move directli below the laser while it is still spin and the laser beam fire as each locat come into align the laser beam gradual trim awai the imbalanc area to correct the balanc fig 15 not reproduc thi correct oper is perform on two separ stage on a singl gener while measur ar be taken on on stage the laser beam is trim the surfac on the other stage thi is accomplish by chang the path of the laser beam by move a prism insid the gener and altern send the beam to the two stage norio yoshida senior engin high energi process develop lab product engin research laboratori matsushita electr work sai from measur to correct the time requir to balanc each rotor is onli about 5 second so the introduct of the yag laser ha increas oper effici as mani as 300 000 rotor a month ar process by thi method surfac modif yag laser ar not onli us for weld and open hole recent the move to us yag laser as a mean for modifi surfac ha attract attent surfac modif is a method of provid the surfac of a materi with new function by build up anoth substanc on top of it clad on exampl is ad metal powder to the surfac of a materi that must be corros and wear resist and then expos that area to a yag laser beam to melt the metal fig 16 surfac modif of insid wall of easili corrod thin tube with 100 meter long optic fiber the engin laboratori of ishikawajima harima heavi industri compani is on place us yag laser for surfac modif thi lab ha combin a yag laser and a 100 meter long optic fiber to perform surfac modif on structur materi requir corros resist sup 7 8 thi techniqu is be us on the insid wall of stainless steel pipe in exist nuclear power plant stainless steel pipe suffer a local loss of corros resist when expos to a larg amount of heat such as weld moreov the narrowest of these pipe ha an insid diamet of onli 40 mm therefor thi is a prevent mainten techniqu develop by ishikawajima harima to fight corros in which an optic fiber is pass through the pipe and a yag laser beam is us to form a clad layer on area with reduc corros resist for exampl surfac modif is possibl on a site 10 cm wide at the tip of a pipe 5 meter long weld is a method gener us in surfac modif weld form a protect layer by pound the metal powder into the substrat howev becaus the coat is not chemic bond to the substrat it ha rel poor adher and easili becom porou therefor weld is not suit for surfac modif of structur materi when the purpos is to increas corros resist on the other hand when a laser beam is us for surfac modif the metal coat and the substrat ar bond metallurg so there is good adher and the atom in the structur ar tightli pack moreov the heat effect on the substrat ar minim sinc a small area can be select fuse current high output co sup 2 laser ar often us for laser beam surfac modif howev becaus the equip is larg and optic fiber cannot be us co sup 2 laser cannot be us in on site oper where surfac modif must be perform insid exist plant therefor ishikawajima harima research thought that if a yag laser and optic fiber could be us it would be possibl to expos narrow space and the insid of pipe in exist facil easili with a laser until now there ha been no method for form a dens highli adher coat in narrow space such as the insid of pipe expect grow for low output laser beam as surfac modif tool the actual procedur for surfac modif is as follow first the metal powder is mix with an organ solvent binder to form a past in the case of the insid of stainless steel pipe it is effect to form a clad layer with a high chrome high nickel molybdenum seri metal for corros resist so the powder consist of a mixtur of these metal next a special devic is us to form a uniform coat of thi metal powder past in the pipe the thick of the coat is roughli 0 2 1 0 mm after coat is complet a yag laser beam is pass through the pipe via an optic fiber and the metal powder coat is expos the direct of the beam is alter by a reflect mirror the reflect mirror is rotat as the laser beam torch is withdrawn and thi creat a continu bead like a pipe thread that form the clad layer the laser us in thi process is a continu wave type with an output of about 400 w and an exposur rate of about 0 2 meter minut norio morishig specialist manag bond research depart ishikawajima harima engin research lab sai for exampl a yag laser with about 500 w of output can perform surfac modif compar to a co sup 2 laser with a 2 kw output the reason low output yag laser can be us for surfac modif is becaus the yag laser wavelength is shorter than the co sup 2 laser wavelength and it is absorb more by the expos materi research at ishikawajima harima want to appli thi yag laser surfac modif techniqu to exterior surfac of structur materi requir high temperatur and wear resist and thei ar involv in develop a practic devic mr morishig continu the yag laser is fulli suitabl for surfac modif we want to find us for it in mani place conclus the us of yag laser have steadili grown howev mr nakamura from matsushita electr work sai it will be a shame if we do not find new us for yag laser not onli product engin but also product design and develop need to realiz the advantag of yag laser and consid the us of yag laser as tool dure the design stage in order to expand the us of yag laser even more us yag laser will contribut to the develop of product with higher ad valu howev problem still remain for manufactur and user of yag laser to solv if thei ar to find wider applic for exampl the biggest obstacl to the purchas of the process equip is high cost although cost have come down over the past two or three year user still have a strong feel that yag laser ar expens thei still seem expens compar to the co sup 2 laser that cost 10 million per kilowatt as yoshio kohara oper manag laser oper center sumitomo heavi industri sai the cost is approach that of co sup 2 laser becaus advanc in technolog have made construct of the power sourc etc less expens some user have said that if the cost come down thei will purchas more yag laser so we can expect manufactur to make attempt to lower the cost in the futur furthermor in term of the hardwar although it is now possibl to control the output waveform with time it is not possibl to control the laser beam intens distribut electr there is an optim intens distribut for process each type of materi some user ar request capabl to freeli chang the distribut of the beam intens such as an intens with a gaussian distribut or an intens that show a differ distribut there ar also problem with user develop product with high ad valu by us laser process fall under the realm of industri secret and

corros on a larg scale while the komsomolet wa ablaz on the surfac militari pilot photograph it from the air these photograph show that the water around the submarin wa liter boil these high temperatur caus the submarin s special coat to peel off and ow to the differ in temperatur between the insid and outsid of the submarin the vessel basic explod natur it is quit imposs to disturb or

the komsomolet that avoid have to bring it to the surfac of all the suggest thei have receiv the specialist from arzama 16 the rubin central design bureau and the committe for carri out special purpos underwat oper under the russian feder govern have pick the safest construct a kind of sarcophagu in the submarin s nose section work on thi project ha been complet it ha been coordin with a dozen

concret at a depth of 1 700 meter but calcul have shown that on soft ground with a densiti of just 1 8 the komsomolet could break up it wa then decid to construct an intern sarcophagu but in thi case it wa assum that special substanc would be us sorbent capabl of absorb ani plutonium that escap eight such sealant were approv in a test dure the latest expedit thei perform well but specialist have chosen the veri best at the moment thei ar run them through yet more test thi summer a new expedit will set off for the sunken komsomolet some 100 kg of sorbent will be pump into the interior mezhbortnoy prostranstvo after thi all the hatch and cabin will be seal constant environment monitor will be organ in the area the oper to construct the sarcophagu at the site of the accid and the

and place of tactic and it principl in evolut of militari art were determin by the signific of the battl in the system of warfar it is known that for mani centuri the battl plai the decid role in the cours and outcom of war and in accomplish mission of strategi principl of prepar and conduct combat oper have origin and taken shape in the depth of tactic and then have been accept by strategi from time immemori thi wa dictat by mani object reason first of all by the fact that for mani centuri mean of warfar were insuffici perfect and all without except were concentr in the tactic sphere secondli armi were rel small and the materi base suppli the war wa poorli develop under such condit militari oper usual develop into a brief clash culmin in a gener engag for a long time the concept of battl wa ident to the concept of militari oper thu the entsiklopediya voyennykh i morskikh nauk encyclopedia of militari and naval scienc publish in 1883 give the follow definit of battl the battl is a gener concept a battl boi of two armi which decid the fate of the war or of a separ oper is call a gener engag or battl bitva a battl boi of two armi of a less definit natur than in the previou case which decid neither the fate of the war nor even of a separ oper but which led to a more or less substanti chang in the situat for both side in the theater of militari oper is call an engag srazheniy a clash of independ part of two armi corp divis is call a battl boi sup 5 with the origin of oper as a new form of warfar there appear a new intermedi link between strategi and tactic oper art which initi wa still not offici recogn by militari theori the battl no longer act as the chief mean of achiev the goal of war but onli as on of it form the oper on local battl no matter how import it might be and even on major engag where the side had sever armi no longer decis affect the gener cours of militari oper the path of war from it begin to it conclus began run through mani mani success and unsuccess offens and defens battl and engag which were combin into armi and then also into front oper oper of a group of armi and the latter into militari campaign that were lengthi in time with the appear of oper art as an independ compon of militari art the need aros for militari theori to identifi the new interrelationship among principl of strategi oper art and tactic tradit interwork between strategi and tactic wa disrupt under the exist condit tactic no longer exert a direct effect but an indirect effect on strategi through oper art onli a multitud of tactic oper in the aggreg sum up produc an oper result and through the oper determin the content of war and it success or unsuccess outcom under the influenc of thi the intern interrelationship among principl of compon part of militari art becam more complic and the influenc of requir of oper art and strategi on the content of principl of battl intensifi the role of battl as the basi and chief mean of achiev the goal of an oper and war wa preserv until the strateg and oper command element had at their dispos their own personnel and equip which were not part of combin arm format and unit thi process began with the appear of aviat in the cours of world war i and continu after it conclus but it wa develop with special forc in world war ii in addit to long rang strateg aviat the strateg oper leadership at that time had airborn troop air defens troop power highli mobil tank and mechan larg strateg format and suprem high command reserv artilleri format these personnel and equip were emploi in oper not onli for reinforc oper and tactic group but also for perform certain independ mission but even under these condit the decis import in achiev oper and strateg result still remain with tactic tactic action continu to hold the princip place in the system of oper thi wa dictat by the fact that immedi defeat of the enemi could be achiev onli by battl and the major of personnel and mean of warfar continu to be at the tactic level the suprem and oper command element were purposefulli in charg of tactic forc and asset and creat favor condit for their employ in prepar and carri out the oper thei specifi object and mission for format and unit organ interwork among them within the scope of the oper gave them combat and logist support and coordin combat oper but alreadi at that time their own specif principl inher onli to these echelon had appear within the framework of oper art and strategi such as attain simultan deep engag of the enemi true in world war ii thi principl wa incomplet implement in practic the problem wa that artilleri which basic wa at the tactic level and whose rang capabl were limit accomplish the primari mission of suppress the enemi although the share of particip of oper and strateg asset in defeat the enemi increas consider it did not becom decis the goal of the oper wa achiev in the final account by joint oper of format and unit on the battlefield and beyond the battlefield by air strike deliv against the enemi at a vari depth by aviat forc by commit of mobil group of front and armi both in the tactic as well as oper zone of enemi defens and also by the land of airborn and amphibi assault forc in the defend rear gener success in such oper wa the result of effort both of tactic as well as oper and strateg asset but the latter s proport in the war remain rel low becaus of their insuffici high combat effect the main enemi forc were pulver chiefli on the battlefield in the tactic zone the battl continu to hold a central place in war not on engag not on oper wa conceiv without it the disposit of forc in militari art becam qualit differ with the appear of nuclear weapon new interrelationship among strategi oper art and tactic took shape under their influenc manifest in the fact that the strateg echelon occupi the predomin role in accomplish mission of war inasmuch as the most power weapon were concentr under it command therefor the question natur aris as to what role tactic should plai in oper under these condit it should be said that the develop of new approach to form principl of militari art did not go smoothli under the new condit both foreign as well as soviet militari literatur express mani differ viewpoint on prospect of develop of militari art and especi tactic for exampl the work voyennaya strategiya militari strategi publish in 1962 under the editorship of v d sokolovskii state that under the new condit the interrelationship of strategi oper art and tactic should be assess in a fundament differ wai the author wrote that the time had pass when it wa consid an indisput fact that a gener victori in war take shape from numer local success modern strateg weapon immedi subordin to high command and permit achiev of decis result in win victori in war often even without the involv of personnel and equip of the tactic and oper level speak in favor of the thesi that local success now can be determin by success of a gener strateg natur sup 6 the infer natur stem from such a conclus that the role of tactic essenti is becom secondari under the new condit but such view form under the influenc of nuclear euphoria characterist of the 1960 s when it wa unequivoc believ that a futur world war certainli would be a nuclear war in the 1970 s soviet militari doctrin began to take account of the possibl of the outbreak both of a nuclear as well as a convent world war accordingli the interrelationship of compon part of militari art and the role of tactic were present in a new light the new concept wa reflect in the fullest form in the book by a a grechko vooruzhennyy sili sovetskogo gosudarstva arm forc of the soviet state publish in 1975 speak of the import of tactic the author wrote regardless of the mean by which war is wage tactic remain the base for achiev oper and strateg success and even it begin specif with tactic it is accomplish by tactic and the implement of oper and strateg concept is complet by tactic sup 7 in recent year judici state figur have been conduct intensifi search for those militari strateg concept which would provid an opportun to achiev polit goal without the danger of outbreak of a gener nuclear war threaten disastr consequ for mankind todai s impress of a possibl war differ from past on by the fact that ever greater prefer is given to militari oper with convent

quit obviou that he will have to wander a great deal but while thi will cost the wayfar loss of time and effort it will cost a command loss of peopl and possibl also loss of the battl in order for thi

regul emphas the import of skill interwork command and control mass of forc on decis ax and combat and logist support and the major of our regular command theoret master these provis nevertheless it wa necessari to go through enorm militari ordeal and fight hundr and thousand of battl befor offic learn to realiz in practic the demand of principl of militari art which were simpl in themselv in

never befor have militari affair develop with such intens as now and thi open up a broad expans for offic creativ search both in theori of tactic as well as in practic command and control activ in decisionmak and in innov applic of principl of battl the fact is that at the present stage rate of renew of the troop materi technic base have acceler extraordinarili and inasmuch as tactic as the most dynam sphere of militari art directli reflect process of chang in weapon and combat equip offic ar face with the task of comprehend new phenomena occur in militari affair with maximum mobil and come up with necessari recommend for the troop practic assimil of the most effect method of prepar and conduct battl meet a higher level of develop of mean of warfar such a task is not new the need to develop tactic creativ aros for militari cadr in the past it is known that in the postwar period two qualit leap in upgrad arm occur in the soviet arm forc and each time it demand that the theori of tactic substanti revis view that had form on the natur of combin arm battl and on the content of it fundament principl the first such leap occur in the 1950 s in connect with nuclear weapon becom oper with the troop which as note abov gave rise to a genuin revolut in militari affair and in the alter condit our gener and offic manag to work out fulli and comprehens the method for troop to perform combat mission in the offens and defens and effect method of align combat format of format and unit fire damag of the enemi and organ and accomplish of interwork command and control and comprehens support to battl in the final account all thi wa reflect in the content of principl of combin arm battl mani new mission aros for tactic dure the 1960 s and 1970 s in connect with introduct of missil weapon to the troop which mark the second qualit leap in develop of mean of warfar and militari affair as a whole the increas power depth and quick act natur of weapon in combin with increas troop mobil gave combin arm battl an even greater decis and dynam natur and increas it spatial scope under the alter condit our militari cadr had to work out tactic of modern battl on a more contemporari materi technic basi rethink the principl of it prepar and conduct and bring their content into line with the increas requir of oper art and strategi at the present time a third qualit leap is occur in develop of militari equip within the framework of the continu revolut in militari affair it wa caus not onli by a further upgrad of nuclear weapon but also by the intens develop of deep strike precis autom weapon system and by the ever increas introduct to the ground troop of aircraft divers ew equip and equip for autom command and control of troop and weapon anoth import featur of the present stage in develop of combin arm battl is that substanti chang occur in oper tactic of foreign armi in the earli 1980 s the us armi adopt a fundament new air land oper battl concept and armi of it western european alli adopt a varieti of it the follow on forc attack accord to these concept as note in the field servic regul of these armi the success of combat oper is made depend on observ of four fundament principl initi depth speed and coordin of effort it is emphas that the principl of initi requir preempt the enemi in order to disorgan hi troop and alter the correl of personnel and equip in on s own favor the essenc of the principl of depth is to comprehens strive to increas rate of advanc and spatial scope of combat oper it is believ that success of offens and defens oper depend to a decis extent on time reliabl engag of the enemi to the full depth of hi combat align the goal of deep interdict in the offens note the regul is to isol the combat oper area disrupt the defend s maneuv reduc the mobil of hi action not allow a regroup of personnel and equip to restor defens integr prevent the approach of reserv and cut them off from the main bodi the follow ar the primari mission of deep fire interdict in the defens split and disorgan the attack s combat format destroi enemi weapon command and control facil and commun center and cover an ongo maneuv of personnel and equip the principl of speed envisag flexibl in the organ of troop and prompt in the think of command who ar capabl of preempt the enemi in oper and immedi counter him with measur which mai lead to disrupt of hi plan the principl of coordin of effort is understood to mean complet unif of effort of all troop involv in the battl and also of weapon nuclear chemic and convent to achiev maximum combat power and most effect us of combat capabl of troop as a whole and of each unit separ profound cardin chang in view on the natur of battl both in our own armi as well as in foreign armi elev the role of command tactic art creativ search for new solut in method of prepar and conduct combat oper the develop and enrich of principl of militari art and foresight of prospect for develop of tactic now ar especi import the entir system for train and educ militari cadr must be direct forward refer to histori it can be note that the most preval mistak of mani armi wa that thei often prepar for the past war if it can be thu express that is thei could not determin the outlin of futur oper and battl accur enough and out of inertia continu to master those principl of combat oper which alreadi had becom obsolet long ago at on time a a svechin editor of strategiya v trudakh voyennykh klassikov strategi in work of militari classic speak of the work by french militari theorist foch on principl of war correctli note that it contain the present militari system but on that ha proven to be not at all in conform with that realiti which world war unfold sup 13 it must be said that a multitud of major mistak and miscalcul were made at all level strateg oper and tactic both on the ev of world war i as well as of world war ii it cannot be said that our armi and it militari cadr present have shift complet to the new train system and have rid themselv of the burden of attribut of stagnant time in combat train proof of thi is that at time in the cours of conduct tactic exercis

although the word of the absolut major of principl of combin arm battl ha not undergon chang in recent time despit the revolutionari renew of tactic their intern content and most import wai and method

confus and helpless of command who were try to get their bear in the situat establish commun with the senior command receiv at least some kind of instruct and take control into their own hand all thi wa perceiv as a nightmarish dream i final came to my sens onli when i heard the desper appeal for help of a comrad who had been caught beneath a heap of rubbl that wa how the great patriot war began for me even now after 50 year have elaps sinc that time i do not ceas to ask myself how could thi have happen for on the even befor on sundai we heard the cheer song over the radio should tomorrow war come should tomorrow we march be readi todai for the march the song not onli summon but also inspir and we ll crush the enemi with littl blood with a power blow and a week befor that we were read an address of the baltic militari district militari council todai as never befor it said we must be in full combat readi everyon must understand thi firmli and clearli sinc we must be readi to perform the combat mission at ani minut later i found thi portent document in the ministri of defens central archiv sup 1 dure the war in the circl of other offic we often discuss event of 22 june and said no after everyth we have gone through thi must not be repeat the lesson is too cruel and instruct and in fact if we take our militari literatur of todai it is a rare book in which you will not find the call to strengthen combat readi but each appeal even the most seriou on lose acut from frequent us that often happen with us even now but about thi later now i would like to sai that the tragic event of 1941 might not have happen had we been respect toward militari histori had we known it had we not been deaf to it lesson the fact is the russo japanes war which as we know also began suddenli wa a great warn for us histori is a great wise teacher the past even the veri distant past teach a great deal thi is why i decid to begin my account about combat readi with histori although the term combat readi becam current and began to be regard as on of the principl of militari art rel recent from time immemori militari leader have observ it requir and attempt to keep the armi in such a state that it wa capabl of go on the march and defeat or repel the enemi it wa ancient roman historian onasand who wrote about thi in the work manual for militari leader he recommend in organ the march to keep

german of psycholog attack deep tank spearhead creation of larg and small pocket and a drop of airborn assault forc and sabotag team in our rear prove unexpect for the troop the terribl event of those year again and again give a remind of the immut truth that war punish sever for peacetim blunder in question of combat readi on of the major mistak in the red armi combat readi system in prewar year wa that personnel were orient toward easi condit toward win victori with littl blood with a power blow and toward conduct combat oper on enemi territori the defens wa underestim and the withdraw and combat in encircl were not studi but it wa specif with difficult defens battl with a withdraw and with combat in encircl that our troop combat oper began for which thei were not readi the imperfect of the combat readi system wa on of the main precondit for defeat of mani armi in local war as well their lack of readi to repel the enemi s first surpris attack told the multistep system that wa us for place format in a combat readi statu in a period of threat and with the begin of militari oper lengthi collect of situat data slow and usual manual process of that data sluggish in decisionmak and give unit and weapon imprecis and often belat or even contradictori instruct led to where the aggressor succeed in catch troop unawar seiz the initi impos hi will and dictat hi condit now it ha becom obviou that mani armi do not manag to restructur their combat readi system and troop train in accord with demand of scientif technic progress the appear of new weapon catch unawar those who ar unconcern with time modern not onli of their mean of warfar but also of tactic here ar just a few exampl from the experi of local war the korean war 1950 1953 broke out just five year after world war

attack and defeat him just what problem ar aris now in upgrad the combat readi system and what ar the wai of solv them correct profound foresight of the natur of a futur war for which it is necessari to prepar is the veri first precondit for success accomplish of task of improv troop combat readi exclus respons for thi rest with militari theori it is what must develop and determin the right refer point in combat train what and how should the troop be taught so thei ar readi for ani ordeal have good masteri of weapon and the tactic of modern battl know the probabl enemi and hi strong and weak side and be abl to combat the latest weapon and protect themselv against them develop scenario of futur battl is on of the most difficult task of militari art histori attest to the fact that militari theorist and practition far from alwai manag to penetr the veil of time and displai profound insight with respect to develop advis method of combat oper it often happen that an armi wa prepar essenti not for a futur war but for a past war and master antiqu obsolet method of combat oper in other case militari theori overestim or convers underestim the experi of small war and drew incorrect on side conclus from it regard combat readi the influenc of new weapon on tactic wa not alwai taken fulli and comprehens into account and bias were allow in assess of the enemi s actual combat capabl and method of hi probabl oper with the initi and conduct of war in our time forecast the condit and natur of a futur war ha becom unbeliev complic abov all becaus the upgrad and replac of mean of warfar and the troop technic outfit is occur at unprecedentedli rapid rate and thi introduc radic chang to battl tactic it is common knowledg that under present condit 3 4 gener of equip chang in the life of on human gener sup 30 base on thi as shown by the experi of local war the attack side s massiv introduct of the latest system of weapon and combat equip previous unknown to the enemi as well as the us of unexpect tactic have becom characterist of combat oper in first oper but the most import distinct is that there is the danger of employ of nuclear weapon as well as of divers system of precis weapon reconnaiss strike complex reconnaiss fire complex which approxim nuclear weapon just the veri fact of exist of these exception effect kind of weapon forc troop to be in constant readi for oper when these weapon ar emploi and to take appropri measur of protect special demand on the troop combat readi system at the present stage also stem from the circumst that there ha been a sharp increas in the signific of the factor of surpris which larg predetermin not onli the cours and outcom of first oper but also of the entir militari campaign the experi of local war ha shown clearli that it pernici consequ becam irrevers in those armi which did not take advanc measur to prevent surpris in thi connect on import task of militari theori is to comprehens research and come up with recommend on upgrad the combat readi system so an aggressor cannot catch troop unawar and unprepar and so thei can repel an enemi invas in ani even the most difficult situat deliv a retaliatori attack against him and successfulli execut assign combat mission the combat readi system cannot form abstractli without consider of specif condit of the troop entri into war research ha shown that the first dai of war and the first battl ar the most difficult critic moment for them it is initi oper that ar the touchston on which the vital of the prewar combat readi system the provis of regul develop in peacetim the norm indic of troop combat profici the command and control system the personnel s moral and fight qualiti and so on ar test henc the princip direct of peacetim combat train is to studi condit of

time so thei have a clear pictur of what thei will encount in actual battl and what kind of enemi thei will come up against thei must be taught the abil to counter enemi tactic with their own more advanc tactic emploi a more skill maneuv and strive for a turn point in the situat and seizur of the initi for thi it is necessari that everi offic nco and privat know hi duti precis and perform them without fuss in a combat alert so that in the terribl hour of ordeal equip and weapon do not let him down and instrument hardwar and mechan oper faultlessli battl sternli test troop for combat matur ideolog condit staunch courag and braveri and punish mercilessli for blunder readi for militari ordeal must be comprehens the modern soldier ha to know and be capabl of a great deal in order to

all the time thei ar differ todai than thei were yesterdai and tomorrow thei inevit will be differ than todai therefor the respons for the state of combat readi is constantli increas let us pose the question ar we do everyth in the armi now as demand by condit of modern war from the standpoint of adjust the effect of combat train so that it is possibl to sai with all confid that the mistak of

repeat here there and everywher but deep seat process also indic someth els concern is grow among the offic for the state of affair in troop combat readi peopl ar argu in a concern wai think and seek an answer to question which life pose for them among the problem relat to troop combat profici greatest attent is drawn by the follow why have our tactic which absorb the rich experi of the past which stood up under a sever test on the battlefield and which prove their indisput superior over tactic of lead world armi in year of the civil war and great patriot war late begun to fall behind the demand of life thu have a neg effect on troop combat readi why have stereotyp and conservat penetr deepli into combat train why have formal and convention with their inher maximum program natur of

pain question ar pose without have answer them without have delv into the reason which dictat the domin influenc in the troop train system of dogmat blinder which shackl offic creativ think and retard the perestroyka process it is imposs to accomplish the cardin task of achiev a radic turn point in improv troop combat train it should be said that neg phenomena in combat train have been accumul for us for year and even decad as a result not on but a multitud of differ object and subject reason have been concentr which predetermin the stagnat in troop train and educ abov all we will note that the veri difficult process of develop militari affair cannot be understood and explain correctli if it is consid by itself outsid of contact with the life of societi militari organiz develop alwai ha been and is now under the determin influenc of a system of sociopolit and socioeconom factor and act as a uniqu reflect of their develop level the ailment of societi in year of stagnat could not help but affect the state of the arm forc thi wa manifest in particular in the fact that a firm belief wa implant in peopl s social awar includ among servicemen that our advanc on all front wa go accord to law of acceler develop thi inspir confid that we were steadili on the ascent and the thought did not aris about the possibl of ani kind of lag the thesi that advantag of the system of social also ensur advantag of it militari organ sup 31 wa interpret straightforwardli in be guid by thi thesi the attent of militari cadr wa not alwai direct to the fact that the social system in itself mere creat object precondit for success accomplish of task and that it can in no wai insur the armi against mistak and lag in thi connect it is imposs not to reproach our militari philosoph whose sacr duti is to arm offic with correct methodolog line conform to the spirit of the time and to act as pace setter in an uncompromis struggl against manifest of inert clich and routin in militari affair unfortun our militari philosoph thought did not withstand the euphoria of gener success in the stagnant time and did not perceiv in due cours the growth of crisi phenomena in combat train dure the 1960 s and 1970 s it is necessari to speak about thi now becaus without the involv of social scienc without activ of the ideolog theoret activ of militari scientist philosoph sociologist psychologist and economist and without appropri scientif and philosoph comprehens of the process occur in the armi it is imposs to achiev a fundament perestroyka of militari scienc in accord with new polit think a qualit turn point in improv of troop combat train and the reviv of tactic as a genuin art of conduct modern battl but thi by no mean reliev the combin arm gener and offic of respons for the state of affair in the troop the deep root of the lag in the system of troop train and educ must be sought first and foremost in routin tactic think in administr pressur method and voluntarist method of direct combat train and in the domin influenc of ostent subjectiv and parochi in the awar of a certain portion of militari cadr speak of reason for a temporari suspens in question of tactic some author ar inclin to believ that thi occur to a certain extent through the fault of certain militari leader who came to promin dure the great patriot war these author assum that their opinion base on victori combat experi in the final account turn into a kind of pattern into a stereotyp sup 32 without a doubt thoughtless fetish of front experi and mechan follow it under new alter condit could not help but neg affect the develop of tactic of militari art as a whole and the troop train system but it would appear that on of the main reason for the penetr of dogmat and stagnat into combat train nevertheless li in someth els in the fact that the veri abund combat experi of soviet troop won at a dear cost in fierc battl in it time ceas to be analyz from contemporari posit larg remain unus did not work in a genuin wai to form offic creativ think and did not contribut to the develop of new oper tactic concept it is necessari to return to the first postwar year to find the root of such a superfici attitud toward soviet troop combat experi immedi follow the end of the great patriot war an aureol of infal of soviet tactic began to be creat in the era of stalin s cult of person thi in itself preclud ani kind of critic of mistak and failur which of cours occur in combat readi of format and unit in prewar time and which had a neg effect on the cours of troop combat oper with the begin of war it wa essenti complet forgotten that our armi arm with obsolet tactic enter into opposit with a veri strong and veri experienc fascist german armi and it essenti had to learn to fight anew in the flame of battl common sens suggest that our armi s failur in 1941 should not have pass without leav a trace for subsequ improv of the troop combat readi system without belittl the great of the soviet armi which despit everyth manag to wrest victori from the hand of a power enemi it wa insist necessari to soberli and imparti understand how and why failur were allow in troop combat train on the ev of war which dictat the enorm loss with the begin of war and loss of strateg initi but the ancient wisdom that sai whoever doe not learn from past mistak inevit is forc to repeat them clearli did no good strictli speak that is just what happen with us after the war certain prewar concept which had not proven themselv again prevail thi concern abov all the assess of the role and place of defens in tactic train for a long time it simpli wa ignor and the most difficult mobil form of defens oper the withdraw battl in encircl and repuls of the first and most crafti attack of the enemi with the begin of war were not rehears and combat experi itself sometim wa receiv in a hypertrophi form and instead of benefit sometim did a certain amount of harm to troop field train thu the popular in militari histori textbook primarili of win tactic episod in which soviet unit achiev success led in the final account to where a superfici impress about battl form in young offic and the opinion began to predomin that it seemingli could be won without particular effort and without thorough train the archaic stereotyp methodolog of conduct tactic exercis especi field fire exercis and thoroughli

thi in tactic problem it becam the rule to conduct ground reconnaiss hastili often accord to the same type of scheme and to rehears deliveri of fire interwork and command and control hurriedli even

indetermin thing also did not get by without certain cost under the influenc of nuclear weapon attent toward tactic wa relax especi toward develop method of combat oper in the cours of a convent war thi also retard it develop and what wa import wa that the era of rapid renew of the mean of warfar did not introduc a radic turn point to the psycholog of offic tactic think the old tactic yardstick larg were retain ground air electron battl even with us of nuclear weapon wa view larg in the light of experi of past war the stereotyp approach which domin for mani year did not disappear into the

tactic did not prevail over banal dare risk over passiv caution or innov over slaveri to routin neg process in combat train without question could not have grown to a critic point had democrat tradit not been lost at on time in the soviet militari press it wa the broad exchang of opinion of command and polit personnel in page of the journal voyna i revolyutsiya voyennaya mysl mekhanizatsiya i motorizatsiya rkka and voyennyi vestnik and in the newspap krasnaya zvezda and discuss held regularli in the 1920 s that larg contribut to a proper orient of militari cadr and their develop of view on

of develop of strategi oper art and tactic it wa not by chanc that soviet militari art made a sharp spurt in it develop specif in those year evid of thi wa for exampl develop of the theori of deep battl and oper but the subsequ banish of live discuss and creativ think and the actual remov of the broad armi public from polem discuss of militari problem in the page of the press dealt an especi heavi blow to tactic which well known soviet militari leader a i yegorov aptli call all armi creativ work experi show that tactic thought is bold and sharp and is in full swing when nourish by the

block even in the press and if bold out of the ordinari thought were express as a rule thei were not heed the fact that dure the last four and on half decad not on broad discuss of problem of tactic ha been held in page of the press eloqu attest to the damp of creativ search it stand to reason that on cannot help but take into account the specif of militari servic in militari affair it is extrem import to have unifi view unifi approach and norm for fundament issu herein li the great import of doctrin line and the consider of demand and principl of militari art develop by centuri old practic herein is manifest the organ disciplin role of regul manual instruct order and direct but excess central and the attempt to establish full like minded in tactic ar just as harm as lack of a system if everyth is decid by direct from abov then the lower strata ar left with noth els other than to await instruct of higher command there where the practic of await innov with the stamp of approv of higher up ha been establish offic inevit form a contempl psycholog creativ activ di out and tactic which is the bearer of everyth foremost and new in the final account turn into a preserv of inert and lack of initi stagnat in tactic also wa facilit to no small extent by the fact that for a long time it took a back seat in our lead journal and militari theoret and militari histor work a gap wa creat between strategi oper art and tactic and thi could not help but tell on develop of militari theori and practic and on the gener state of troop combat readi there ar numer exampl of thi for exampl the rubric format tactic appear in voyennaya mysl onli in the earli 1980 s befor thi evid it wa believ that tactic question were too petti to be consid in a militari theoret journal in thi connect i forese the object that there is a special journal voyennyi vestnik which is tactic in purpos for thi ye thi is so but on onli ha to look carefulli at the subject matter of articl in thi journal and it becom clear that it write ar strictli of an appli natur and ar design chiefli for the lower tactic echelon platoon compani and battalion command other journal and newspap also rare come out with problem orient tactic articl but the fact is that thei could influenc format of new tactic think in offic and agit thought more activ with provoc polem write extrem few book on tactic ar be publish never befor in the entir histori of our armi ha the offic s librari been so bare as now the first militari theoret work taktika tactic appear onli after 20 year had pass sinc the end of the great patriot war 1966 and had a veri limit print onli a total of three edit of thi book came out in postwar time sup 34 we will note that too few construct idea and innov thought ar advanc in publish work on tactic theori of tactic doe not alwai act as a drive oscil of perestroyka process the era of the cult of person and stagnat implant norm think in mani offic and led to depreci of theori mani textbook were written as if us carbon paper in a formal style provis of regul ar retold in them accord to the same type of scheme often thei do not discuss ani kind of genuin tactic art dogmat restrict fear of go beyond the bound of customari idea banal instead of origin tediou rehash of common truth and callous thought those ar the main thing that dictat the creativ steril in militari theori and the deaf to innov thi difficult heritag of stagnat will drag militari affair backward like a heavi weight for a long time yet if a resolut struggl is not put up against it the insuffici high level of scientif achiev in tactic larg is determin by an absenc of fundament militari theoret research in prospect problem of combat readi primaci wa given to current strictli appli momentari interest no work appear here in postwar year that were equal in theoret depth bold and scale of pose question to such work as novoy v razvitii taktiki krasnoi armii new thing in develop of red armi

ogon manevr maskirovka fire maneuv and maskirovka lit camouflag howev includ conceal and decept fbi by a i verkhovskii and other but the fact is these work appear just 5 10 year after the birth of the red armi the circumst that we practic ceas to publish militari theoret work of foreign author begin in the 1960 s did much damag to develop of the theori of tactic new work that appear on the whole remain unnot in journal and newspap and annot and review ar not even provid on them but despit extrem limit capabl in prewar year there were mani public of foreign militari literatur these were work by machiavelli napoleon von clausewitz jomini delbr uck foch k uhlmann fuller langloi and other it follow from the abov that at the present stage in theori and practic of militari art and in question of troop combat readi a need aris to rethink and reassess a great deal in light of the increas demand of the time and chang in the materi base of warfar not simpli cosmet cleans is need but fundament perestroyka for mani posit and a search for new approach and fundament new solut it would appear that abov all it is import to sharpli elev the social statu of militari theori and genuin not in word but in fact give full plai to innov scientif thought it is pervers and inadmiss to set theori and practic in opposit and to calcul in percentag how much there should be of theoret class and how much of practic let alon in higher militari educ institut theori must be present in liter everi class it is imposs to resolv ani practic question without thi searchlight of scientif thought in an impetu time of scientif technic progress it is pernici to reduc the role of theori onli to regist event and interpret provis of regul militari affair mean dynam constant uniqu destruct of stereotyp and establish postul a continu search and confirm of new thing and the bold rush of thought into the futur even the most radic chang in the materi technic base of battl cannot automat of themselv lead to the appear of new form and method of combat oper to the establish of new tactic think the greatest import in thi belong to a theori unswaddl by ani line free of a bias approach and of pressur from abov under present condit it must develop a scientif concept of perestroyka in the troop combat readi system without theoret studi all practic condit in upgrad the system will be done blindli by guesswork a need ha matur to infus a new spirit into tactic train methodolog especi in higher militari educ institut it is advis to teach offic not tactic but the art of tactic to teach them not decisionmak for battl but the art of make such a decis and so on the fundament differ is that with the new methodolog the princip goal of train is not to learn the work scheme of a command and staff offic in a combat situat but teach them to creativ analyz compar forese the develop of combat event find wai out of difficult situat displai aggress emploi procedur of decept and stratagem and strive for victori by mean of skill in thi connect there is increas import of problem explor method of hold class and give lectur of us of mathemat model of the engag or battl of atyp game of problem solv by the brainstorm method and so on militari histor scienc plai an import role in upgrad the combat readi system it must work more for the present the time ha come for militari historian to shift to a new higher stage of scientif disclosur of the veri abund great patriot war experi to a detail comparison of belliger plan with the involv of new archiv sourc to a profound comprehens of event to a demonstr of what kind of troop loss result from miscalcul and insuffici consid decis and to an analysi of how mani command and staff manag to win victori over superior enemi forc thank to tactic profici a qualiti research work on the develop of militari art in local war and abov all on experi of combat oper in afghanistan is veri necessari it is import to deepli comprehend the combat experi gain in thi war and learn instruct lesson from it especi in fight in the mountain and improv reconnaiss physic and psycholog train of personnel it should be note that the work of analyz and us combat train experi in order to upgrad combat readi still is unsatisfactori each year a larg number of variou exercis ar held in the troop but their result ar not properli gener and most import ar not commun to the troop and higher militari educ institut a strang practic ha form while it is the practic to have an analyt survei of the experi of oper tactic train of armi of the unit state and nato in page of central militari journal our own combat train experi goe ignor it is not access to the broad armi public it turn out that such truli invalu scientif capit on which by the wai no small amount ar spent doe not produc a proper practic return for improv combat train and combat readi often disappear in the archiv without a trace and doe not receiv new life in textbook and train manual but the fact is thi is first rate build materi for combat improv of troop and for militari theori in the final account the job of radic improv combat readi never will budg decis until the entir broad armi public join in a discuss of press problem in page of the press and wage a resolut struggl against obduraci slaveri to routin and stagnant phenomena the reviv of democrat tradit in the press and broad

kutuzov would inspir the soldier and thei would displai suprem decis and valor here for exampl is how a particip of the battl of borodino f glinka describ it experi show that the russian line that ha

will turn ourselv insid out we will begin to hit the front on from the front face and the rear on from the rear face sup 16 in describ the field generalship art of barclai de tolli mani militari historian focu attent on hi excess caution but when necessari he also skillfulli emploi the principl of decis and aggress in set forth hi war strategi in a letter to p i bagrat on 1 june 1812 de tolli

k marx and f engel had high esteem for the field generalship activ of barclai de tolli in the first stage of war thei note that he execut a withdraw with wonder art sup 18 h jomini also wrote about thi that withdraw which the russian armi made in 1812 from the neman to moscow over a distanc of 240 lieue approxim 1 080 km without allow an enemi such as napoleon to put them in disarrai or partial defeat them should be place abov all other sup 19 jomini note that the principl of decis and aggress should be emploi in close combin with the principl of concentr of effort and attain of surpris in oper if militari art he wrote consist of throw on s forc at a decis point it is understand that the first mean for applic of thi principl will be seiz the initi in oper whoever ha seiz thi initi know in advanc what he is do and what he want with hi mass he arriv at that point where he should deliv the blow whoever wait is preempt everywher the enemi pounc on separ part of hi armi he know neither where the enemi wish to direct hi effort nor the mean which he must counter sup 20 also to jomini s credit in develop thi principl is that for the first time he extend it not onli to the offens but also to the defens jomini correctli point out that the defens must not be wait but aggress in purpos and must includ element of the offens i e bear an offens defens charact c von clausewitz call thi principl bold firm and aggress he remark that theori ha no right to restrict it by virtu of it legisl power bold is a creativ power even foolhardi that is bold without an object is not to be despis bold lend wing to the mind and the discern it is imposs to imagin a distinguish gener without bold sup 21 clausewitz set asid just as signific a role for firm in a militari leader s activ he wrote that a command find himself in a constant whirlpool of fals and true inform of mistak commit through fear through neglig through precipit of contravent of hi author either from mistaken or correct motiv from ill will true or fals sens of duti indol or exhaust of accid which no mortal could have foreseen sup 22 and on who take it into hi head to yield to these impress conclud clausewitz will displai weak he will be incap of firmli defend or of implement a decis speak of decis and aggress the militari classic note that our basic principl is to view the destruct of enemi arm forc as the most import thing not onli in the entir war but also in each individu battl sup 23 as we see clausewitz s opinion in thi matter fulli coincid with the view of napoleon attain of the princip goal of war destruct of the enemi accord to clausewitz is achiev onli by battl tactic success in war he wrote have a domin import sup 24 thi thesi wa correct for that time but now strateg and oper echelon have their own veri effect mean of warfar which ar not part of format therefor the role of tactic and the battl should be view in a differ manner in the overal system of oper and engag in analyz the experi of war of the late 18th and 19th centuri on can be convinc as to what major role the steadili increas firepow plai in the chang in content of the principl of decis and aggress adopt of firearm

gigant height and woe to it enemi should it rise at some time sup 26 the principl of decis and aggress can be trace through the work of g a leyer and m i dragomirov the veri worst thing on which on

the content of principl of tactic mani militari theorist conclud that from now on fire would displac hand to hand combat more and more thi thought wa express rather precis by a a neznamov who wrote decis success in a modern engag is base on attain a preponder of fire silent weapon have fade into the background sup 30 from an assess of the factor of fire he draw the conclus that under it influenc the intens and aggress of combat oper will increas and tactic paus will shorten he note the time is past in a war when peopl fought for week but wait for month sup 31 work by neznamov and other author note a trend toward substanti chang in confront of the offens and defens under the influenc of develop of mean of warfar while confront of the offens and defens had the natur of a confront of strength befor the appear of firearm and wa accomplish in the form of a brief clash of close order infantri or cavalri mass where the outcom of the battl depend on the forc of soldier physic attack with the appear of firearm belliger receiv the opportun of exert influenc on each other at a distanc as a result of which troop loss increas and their determin in hold posit and their aggress and decis in the offens rose fire began to act as the princip motiv forc in upgrad form and method of prepar and conduct combat oper thi wa manifest veri clearli in the russo japanes war in which new offens battl tactic were emploi under condit of strengthen rifl machinegun and artilleri firepow decis wa reflect in an increas proport of night battl and employ of certain new mean of warfar the resourc and invent of russian soldier and offic were of great import in increas combat aggress thu in the defens of port arthur a method wa found for throw round sea mine from fortress fortif into the assault japanes infantri hand grenad also were us successfulli the world s first model of mortar were creat with a rang of fire up to 500 pace and the first bomb thrower for fire a six inch 152 mm bomb were design siegecraft and countermin warfar wa emploi rather wide chang in the natur of battl it increas durat intens and spatial scope and the increas complex of command and control of subunit with the us of thin extend line on the battlefield sharpli increas the role of independ action of initi by command at the tactic level subsequ thi wa reflect in the ustav polevoi sluzhbi russkoi armii russian armi field servic regul publish in 1912 it instruct everi command and rank and file soldier is grant independ in execut hi assign mission he should displai hi own initi in action in conform with situat chang if thi is necessari for achiev a common caus without await an order to himself from the senior command attent also should be given to the fact that the aforement regul includ a section on the meet engag for the first time thi occur under the influenc of russo japanes war experi prior to thi war neither regul of the russian armi nor of other european armi gave ani instruct regard it conduct the russian nastavleniy dlya deystviya v boyu otryadov iz vsekh rodov oruzhiya manual for action in battl by detach of all combat arm 1904 had onli the most gener instruct on thi question the meet engag wa view as a rare chanc phenomenon troop did not studi thi kind of combat in exercis and maneuv therefor the circumst that numer major meet engag occur dure the russo japanes war in a vast space between the river huanho and shaho in octob 1904 wa a great surpris to the russian command both side attempt to take the initi into their hand and depriv the enemi of freedom of action by an assault on a select axi with superior forc but just like hi enemi gener oyama gener a n kuropatkin displai indecis he extend troop across a broad front out of fear of envelop of the flank condit for

mani case miss an opportun for decis action russo japanes war experi with respect to develop of the principl of decis and aggress wa reflect in field manual of the russian and other european armi publish prior to world war i the aforement russian ustav polevoi sluzhbi field servic regul 1912 gave the main attent to offens battl thei point out an attack on the enemi serv as the most effect mean for defeat him at the same time the regul did not deni the import of the defens and recogn a transit to the defens to be necessari when the assign goal could not be achiev by the offens the regul demand that the defens be aggress and end with the launch of an offens in defend on must strive by all method and mean to place the enemi in disarrai by fire and have undermin hi moral launch an offens and defeat him the regul paid attent to battl at night and in the mountain but it had no provis about the need for conduct artilleri prepar prior to an assault which wa taught by russo japanes war experi despit certain shortcom the field servic regul were the best in europ at that time the german infantri drill regul took poor account of the influenc of fire it demand that the infantri attack continu and move at full height without us of the terrain and without dig in the french infantri drill regul 1904 underestim the increas import in battl not onli of artilleri but also of rifl and machinegun fire in the offens the regul provid for deploi the infantri into an extend line with an interv onli of on pace between fight men it should be said that the defens wa underestim in mani european armi on the ev of world war i thu it wa note in the french manual for senior troop command 1914 that have return to it militari tradit have in mind the napoleon war iv the french armi doe not allow anoth law in conduct oper than the offens sup 32 such a on side approach to assess the kind of combat oper result in no small loss for armi in the cours of militari oper mistak made in prewar time had to be correct on the battlefield the content of the principl of decis and aggress underw substanti chang in war of the 20th centuri compar with war of the 19th centuri thi wa dictat by the upgrad of armi technic outfit and mean of command and control and support and by increas scope of militari oper in the pre imperialist period offens and defens oper usual were accomplish within the framework of on engag which unfold on rel limit territori and wa wage for a short time for exampl the battl of borodino in 1812 unfold on a front of around 8 km to a depth of up to 6 km and last onli a few hour in war of the 20th centuri the confront of offens and defens took on a more determin and intens natur now it wa carri on in the form of sever success offens and defens engag which began to develop into a new form of militari action the oper thu in the russo japanes war the continu front of battl reach 75 km at liaoyang and 155 km at mukden depth of the engag increas from 2 4 to 25 50 km and the durat rose from 1 2 to 10 17 dai offens action were close combin with defens on in subsequ war the scope of confront of offens and defens increas even more and the content of the principl of

regard the meet engag to a veri tough test and introduc much that wa new to method of it conduct combat experi show that such an engag is distinguish by fluiditi absenc of a continu front and the

conduct aggress offens oper on a broad scale sup 35 decis and aggress were characterist featur of red armi troop oper in the civil war in russia m v frunz note almost all signific oper of civil war time bear trace of a manifest of a spirit of aggress and initi on our side sup 36 thi wa determin not by qualiti of weapon thei were the veri same as in world war i but by featur of combat oper by the absenc of continu static front and most import by the revolutionari enthusiasm of red armi men and command and their initi and innov in emploi decis mobil method of warfar all prewar red armi field

wa not the on who did not achiev success in combat despit all measur taken who deserv reproach but the on who fear respons for failur let the time slip by show no initi and did not take advantag of all opportun for perform the assign mission the aggress decis and offens of troop stem from the content of soviet militari doctrin which provid for wage war onli on enemi territori and defeat him by a power blow in short time period the idea of win victori with littl blood wa so attract that it left no place to be concern with teach troop to fight the lengthi exhaust bloodi defens and offens battl character the war which later came unexpectedli here we see an exampl of be excess carri awai by a decis which did not correspond to a realist assess of the enemi and of on s own combat capabl an attempt by soviet command to act offens no matter what with the begin of war as demand by the suprem militari leadership led to enorm unjustifi loss and a sharp deterior in the troop situat therefor decis and aggress should not be an end in themselv in the final account soviet troop learn to skillfulli appli thi principl in the cours of battl as zhukov note all major offens and counteroffens oper of soviet troop begin with the fall of 1942 were distinguish by origin decis swift and total complet sup 37 just what new thing did world war ii introduc to the content of the principl of decis and aggress abov all we will note that the ratio of attack forc and mean of defens shape up differ in thi war than in world war i in mani oper the attack succeed in achiev a decis fire superior over the defend which wa the result of the chang materi base of war massiv employ of aircraft artilleri and tank in oper in combin with increas strike power and firepow of format enabl not onli make a quick break in of the enemi defens but also decis build up the forc of the attack by commit of mobil group turn tactic success into oper success but even under these rel favor situat condit demand of the

of strike power and penetr of attack troop trend began to be reinforc in the defens toward a transit from a shallow center of resist defens to a continu deepli echelon trench system of build posit and zone which balanc the side capabl if the attack attempt to increas rate of advanc by massiv employ of tank troop the defend side would increas it capabl in respons by upgrad the antitank defens system establish antitank strongpoint center and area to the full depth not onli of the tactic but also of the oper defens the side competit occur in a similar wai in build up attack from the air and reinforc air defens the main sphere of the side opposit in world war ii wa the struggl to win and hold fire superior decis of the offens and attain of high rate of penetr pursuit and nonstop cross of water obstacl by soviet troop larg were ensur by perfect of method of fire damag of the enemi us of the so call artilleri and air offens which provid effect continu fire support to attack infantri and tank to the full depth of combat mission perform plai a major role here but to counterbal thi the german command began seek more effect method of counterbatteri fire and of conduct a counterprepar and it began emploi decept procedur more wide to covertli remov it subunit from the feba into the depth on the ev of soviet troop artilleri prepar of an assault and although the great patriot war experi larg enrich the content of the principl of decis and aggress and soviet command set brilliant exampl of skill realiz of the demand of thi principl in practic mani neg point also were observ decis and aggress were not alwai achiev through art and cun relianc wa place most often on achiev a multipl superior in personnel and equip over the enemi stereotyp procedur and banal sometim occur in prepar and conduct the battl linear method action often prevail over maneuv some command fear of respons also told at time which paralyz a displai of initi the revis of field manual did not alwai keep up with the develop of tactic for exampl in prewar time it wa believ that a platoon or compani command should draw subordin into the assault by person exampl and therefor wa oblig to be in front of the combat format in the first period of war thi led in practic not to increas aggress of action but to heavi loss of command personnel or take anoth exampl prewar red armi field manual provid for a deepli echelon align of the combat format in the offens begin with the compani and end with the divis it wa believ that thi creat condit for decis forward movement at an increas rate but at the begin of the war the german defens wa shallow and center of resist penetr it did not requir have such a consider number of personnel and equip in second echelon and reserv in practic thi led onli to excess personnel loss it often happen that thei suffer heavi loss from enemi fire even befor commit what wa new in realiz thi principl in modern local war wa the increas power and depth of fire damag of the enemi wide employ of airmobil troop and airborn and amphibi assault forc for creat an aggress oper front in the enemi rear and split hi group into part a more frequent and broader us in battl than befor of new weapon napalm combat helicopt guid weapon mlr autom reconnaiss and command and control equip fuel air explos new kind of engin obstacl and so on the result of thi wa an increas in the decis dynam natur and mobil of combat oper militari analyst have calcul that while the coeffici of combat oper intens dure the russo japanes war wa 0 2 and in world war i base on the experi of western countri it wa 0 46 then in world war ii base on experi of the soviet german front it wa 0 88 base on experi of contemporari local war it is approach uniti sup 38 it is appar from thi that the role and import of the principl of decis and aggress in battl ha had a stabl tendenc to rise in the cours of war at the present stage of develop of militari affair materi precondit have been creat for develop of thi trend which is dictat by the outfit of troop with qualit new weapon possess great rang high destruct power accuraci and mobil as well as by veri sophist mean of command and control and support 2 principl of decis and aggress in defens battl high aggress in combin with the troop determin in hold occupi posit is the princip condit for achiev defens stabil combat practic ha shown convincingli that wait and passiv ar pernici for a defend speak of the import of aggress and initi in defens promin soviet militari leader gener of the armi a v gorbatov remark in a convers with young offic that thi is that weapon which you alwai have which alwai will help you get out of a difficult spot even if it theoret turn out that no wai out of the situat at hand is evid let it not frighten you that the enemi is highli experienc and refin and that he surpass you by mani time in forc he still is not all power think organ search well and you definit will find hi vulner spot you will discov hi blunder by take advantag of which you can nullifi all hi effort or even rout him sup 39 the valu of thi advic is immens it come from experi the correl and interrelationship of the defens and offens have appear differ in each war depend on the level of develop of mean of warfar but on also can follow the manifest of a certain gener trend in their interrelationship it is that an ever increas mutual penetr of these kind of combat oper is occur point in time aris more and more often in the offens where it is imposs to get by without defens or to advanc without consolid on captur line offens form and method of oper ar be us more and more wide and fulli in the defens which increas the decis of it goal mani militari analyst ar inclin to conclud from thi circumst that thi trend will have even more strike develop in the futur thu the author of the militari theoret work taktika tactic arriv at the conclus that the contemporari defens is acquir a new qualiti in contrast to the past it is receiv an opportun not onli of repel an attack by superior enemi forc but even of disrupt hi offens sup 40 thi mean that it decis is increas sharpli i assum such a conclus hardli can be deem unequivoc indisput for the side combat capabl ar each grow thi mean that a manifest of decis and aggress of the defens inevit will be oppos by the attack side s determin countermeasur on also cannot fail to take into account that the defens as a kind of combat oper not onli ha strong aspect but also a certain vulner defend troop ar significantli depend on the attack enemi s action just the circumst alon in choos the time place and method of deliv attack ar on the attack s side thi place the defens in an unequ situat with him to thi must be ad that as a rule the attack side possess a quantit or even a qualit superior henc it becom understand that the defens is far from alwai in a posit to impos it will on the attack inasmuch as it chronic experi an acut shortag of personnel and equip opposit of the offens and defens alwai ha been the motiv forc of develop of militari art in all war at the present stage it is manifest with special vivid thi essenti mean that it is necessari to seek new form and method of displai aggress and decis in battl in order to achiev superior over the enemi as shown by combat experi in addit to the advantag taken of object factor much depend here on the tactic creativ of command staff and troop we will refer to the great patriot war experi to illustr thi thesi it is common knowledg that the qualiti of weapon and combat equip did not undergo ani substanti chang whatsoev dure the war but the result of battl includ also in the defens can be said to have been strike in the first and subsequ period thu while enemi troop manag to advanc to a depth of 250 270 km in 67 dai of defens battl dure the battl of moscow thei advanc onli 120 150 km in 124 dai in the battl of stalingrad the maximum advanc of offens group of fascist german troop dure the defens engag at kursk did not exce 35 km the increas stabil of defens by soviet troop in the cours of combat oper wa larg determin by the fact that each time the command and staff tri to find ever more improv tactic thi contribut to attain decis goal in battl now when foreign armi particularli the us armi under the air land oper concept ar seek method for deliv a deep strike in the offens in order to paralyz enemi action in a short time by take advantag of the factor of surpris fig 3 the defend s mission is to counter the attack with hi own more aggress method of opposit to not allow combat format to be broken up later and in depth and to disrupt the enemi s ground and air maneuv fig 3 essenc of the air land oper fig 4 clearli show the possibl form and method of appli the principl of decis and aggress in the defens their common characterist featur is the divers of tactic and the grow role of fire maneuv and obstacl in achiev goal of the defens and although in term of extern characterist certain method of conduct a defens battl ar indistinguish from those us dure world war ii their content ha larg been renew fig 4 method of realiz the principl of take for exampl a well known method such as success deliveri of damag on the enemi as he approach the feba and wedg into the depth of the defens it differ from the past is that the defend now ha the capabl of more activ pressur the enemi in all stage of hi prepar of the offens begin with hi troop concentr in attack posit dure forward movement into the assault and end with the fight to hold defens posit the increas rang of weapon contribut to thi fig 5 thu in world war i artilleri had a rang of fire of 6 000 9 000 m and in a defens could lai down barrag fire ahead of the feba and us fire basic to exert an effect on combat format of attack first echelon regiment thi onli partial weaken the attack troop offens potenti therefor hand to hand combat plai the main role in repel an enemi assault fig 5 caption miss in world war ii the rang of the bulk of artilleri increas to 9 000 12 000 m which enabl the defend to keep the full depth of the combat format of attack enemi format under fire fire aggress and stabil of the defens increas in connect with thi as a result there wa a signific increas in the attack s loss to the fire of defend troop hand to hand combat wa us more rare under present condit the maximum rang of weapon of combin arm format count combat helicopt and support aviat ha increas by 4 5 time compar with world war ii the depth of fire strike ha increas accordingli for exampl base on nato troop exercis experi fire engag of the enemi is plan in the divis defens to a depth of 80 110 km thi mean that us it own asset a format now essenti is capabl of continu exert a fire effect not onli on the enemi s tactic reserv but also on hi immedi oper reserv and of keep him under constant tension when on take into account that now not onli maximum rang but also destruct power and accuraci of weapon strike have increas it becom obviou that the defend is capabl of make wider us of the principl of decis and aggress to achiev hi goal but thi principl is realiz especi effect in the case where a deep combin effect is us on an attack enemi from the ground and air thi is a new form of combat aggress in the defens dictat by the appear of such weapon as precis weapon helicopt ew asset and equip for remot mine of terrain the essenc of thi method of defens battl is to constrain enemi oper to the maximum extent disorgan hi command and control wear him down inflict loss on him and reduc hi offens group rate of advanc by fire the latter is accomplish by land airborn assault forc and raid and reconnaiss unit in the enemi rear by establish defens fire barrier on hi rout of forward movement and by emploi massiv electron jam we will emphas the import role in attain these goal plai by defens fire barrier which ar creat by remot minelai equip in combin with massiv fire strike deliv by reconnaiss strike complex reconnaiss fire complex mlr system combat helicopt and artilleri on effect method of displai combat aggress in the defens is to deliber draw the enemi into a plan area fire pocket and deliv strike against him from the front flank and rear thi is essenti also a new method of conduct defens battl although a withdraw of subunit from the feba into the depth to deceiv the enemi sometim wa emploi in world war ii first of all it wa done on a limit scale secondli it wa done veri rare and thirdli at that time the defend had no opportun to deliv a combin strike against a wedg in enemi from differ direct includ also from the rear now as a result of increas firepow and strike power and employ of airborn assault forc combin arm format more often than befor can deliber creat fire pocket in order to lure the enemi into them and then decis destroi him by massiv artilleri fire strike by aircraft and by reconnaiss strike and reconnaiss fire complex and deliveri of surpris flank counterattack in combin with the land of airborn assault forc in the enemi rear form and method of displai combat aggress in fight the enemi on approach to the defens now have becom more decis and divers in principl even in past war the defend tri to exhaust and wear down the enemi to the maximum extent back befor he launch an assault but capabl for thi were veri limit in world war i due to the short rang of weapon but it wa then that the need aros for establish a shallow 3 4 km secur area ahead of the feba which wa satur with variou obstacl and cover by artilleri fire a tendenc to move the battlefield as far forward as possibl beyond the feba saw further develop in world war ii thi wa manifest in the fact that the depth of the secur area increas to 10 12 km and it stabil also rose due to the fact that it began to have more thorough engin prepar and rather consider forc were assign for it defens a decis form of fire aggress such as conduct an artilleri and air counterprepar against an offens enemi group pois for the attack also began to be emploi to disrupt an enemi offens the soviet command began organ the counterprepar alreadi in the first defens oper in june 1941 on the northwestern axi but it effect wa insignific due to the fact that the enemi group had been poorli reconnoit and there wa a shortag of artilleri and ammunit approxim the veri same thing wa repeat in the battl of leningrad in septemb 1941 and in the battl of moscow although in the latter instanc counterprepar wa prepar more thoroughli by the western front command few personnel and equip were involv in conduct it the counterprepar mission assign wa to disrupt a possibl enemi offens for thi it wa plan to us artilleri fire to suppress and destroi hi infantri and tank in concentr area and at attack posit suppress enemi artilleri and disrupt command and control to thi end detail counterprepar plan were work out in the armi which envisag the involv not onli of gun but also of 82 mm and 120

took part in the counterprepar in assess result of the counterprepar zhukov wrote it should be said that the artilleri staff and all artilleri command of front armi and format work well and wise to organ the artilleri defens and counterprepar sup 43 under present condit opportun ar be creat for increas the effect of counterprepar fire and organ it in shorter time period the involv of precis weapon reconnaiss strike and reconnaiss fire complex a more signific amount of mlr and also front and armi aviat contribut to thi we will note that alreadi in the past war defend troop sometim deliv an attack ahead of the feba to exploit result of the counterprepar with the goal of caus confus in enemi rank disori him with respect to on s plan and reinforc the effect of the fire strike such

accompani by heavi loss in the past counterattack were on of the chief form of displai combat aggress in conduct a posit defens it must be said that in the great patriot war thei were conduct by soviet troop veri often but not alwai successfulli especi in the first period of war here we ar deal with that case where aggress becam an end in itself the sourc of thi subjectivist approach to displai combat aggress in the defens origin in prewar time when the offens idea wa insist advanc in all regul document crush the enemi by a power attack in short time period for exampl here is how thi concept wa interpret in the prewar textbook obshchaya taktika gener tactic which note the guarante of victori in the defens is suprem aggress and decis of oper consist of the troop and their command unceasingli strive not onli to hold up the attack but also to inflict a crush blow on him sup 44 in practic with the begin of militari oper thi develop into a situat where our divis and regiment command were forc to act aggress in accord with the oper plan even in difficult vagu circumst when the enemi surpass our troop mani time in tank and artilleri and when hi aircraft had undivid rule of the air to seiz the initi thei would throw the troop against the enemi and would organ counterattack clearli doom to failur under present condit counterattack by no mean have lost their import as a method of inflict defeat on the enemi and restor a lost posit but in make the decis to conduct them we must weigh everyth dozen of time and calcul what is more advantag repuls an assault of enemi tank and infantri by fire from in place or throw subunit out to meet him a counterattack that is insuffici prepar with respect to fire especi in those case where the enemi ha not been halt and ha a clear superior in personnel and equip can lead to excess loss and worsen the defend s situat the simplest calcul show that a motor rifl battalion is capabl of repel an assault of up to an enemi brigad by fire from in place while it can rout onli a compani in deliv a counterattack but thi doe not mean that on should reject counterattack entir thi would be incorrect inasmuch as a situat mai take shape in battl where it is possibl to improv the situat at hand onli by deliv a counterattack we will dwell in more detail on appli the principl of decis and aggress in a mobil defens as thi question ha been less studi in our militari theori the mobil defens larg differ from the posit defens in goal and method of attain them it is conduct most often as a forc measur in a difficult often critic situat against enemi forc that ar mani time superior therefor command staff and troop ar requir to displai special skill so that thei compens for an acut shortag of personnel and equip win time and exhaust and wear down the attack by delai action on a number of line favor for defens form and method of aggress oper emploi by soviet troop in a mobil defens dure the great patriot war were not distinguish by great divers unit and subunit tri to damag the enemi chiefli by fire as he approach the feba and then without take matter to a decis assault would break contact with him disengag and withdraw to the next defens line in the depth where these oper usual were repeat now the increas fire attack and maneuv capabl of combin arm format and unit permit significantli broaden and enrich tactic be us in order to immobil the attack s initi constantli wear him down and disrupt or hamper maneuv by harass action and mislead him regard on s true intent by mean of decept method fig 6 fig 6 form and method of tactic oper under present condit it appear possibl to make wider us of an effect method of combat the enemi such as ambush oper ambush were emploi rather skillfulli by soviet troop in the mobil defens even in the great patriot war thu in januari 1945 subunit of 110th tank brigad repel up to ten enemi tank attack dure the dai by fire from ambush and therebi support the withdraw of 18th tank corp and it organ transit to a defens northwest of budapest sup 45 but at that time ambush were set up primarili in immedi proxim of the feba in gap and on strongpoint flank and were insuffici mobil now the aggress of fire ambush is grow consider in connect with the fact that not onli tank and motor rifl subunit can be involv in establish them but also combat helicopt ifv apc atgm system air defens system and self propel gun helicopt ambush for exampl can be set up on distant approach to the defens other kind of fire ambush can be establish throughout the zone or in a sector of the defens

mobil defens in contrast to a posit defens in a mobil defens thei usual ar deliv more often but with small forc and briefli and their success is not exploit the main goal of counterattack is to support the disengag of defend subunit deliv a surpris attack on the enemi consider contribut to thi it is not difficult to notic that the basi of all tactic examin which ar emploi in a modern defens is a broad maneuv of fire personnel and equip it is import that it be swift and preemptiv in natur an attack enemi s effort will be successfulli nullifi onli when he is late in deploi in deliv a fire

attack displai indecis and sluggish in action which enabl the defend to recov from the attack and organ a stubborn resist combat experi show that even the argument of forc i e the superior in personnel and equip establish on the main axi mai not plai it role in such a situat here is an exampl in the volkhov oper in the summer of 1943 a superior over the enemi wa achiev in the breakthrough sector of 12th guard rifl divis as follow 1 3 5 in battalion 1 5 in gun and 1 3 in tank but thi did not ensur success dure the assault divis unit succeed in take onli two enemi trench after which their advanc wa halt thi happen becaus sluggish wa shown in take advantag of the result of fire much time wa lost negoti engin obstacl ahead of the feba and the infantri assault wa listless take advantag of thi the enemi manag to restor the disrupt fire plan and soon also undertak a counterattack the command of 69th armi s 312th rifl divis act differ in the vistula oder oper in januari 1945 despit the fact that superior over the enemi in the divis zone of advanc wa minim 1 2 5 in infantri 1 2 3 in tank and 1 2 4 in artilleri success of the unit oper wa signific on the veri first dai the

present function and reflect in field manual is the result of lengthi histor develop mani provis on interwork in prewar red armi field servic regul were view complet differ than now for exampl it wa believ that combat effort of combat arm and element of the combat format should be coordin by line and object in the defens sup 31 but that procedur of interwork wa refut by combat experi dure the great patriot war thi happen becaus line and object ar a veri vagu nonspecif concept it often turn out that each of the interwork command would design them at hi own discret which did not contribut to achiev uniform of understand of the object of oper in battl and thi is the primari task in organ interwork therefor it wa determin in the cours of the war that it wa more advis to organ interwork in the defens not by line but by mission be perform by troop sup 32 thi permit ty in troop oper more purposefulli in conduct battl subsequ in addit to coordin effort by mission it also wa deem necessari to organ interwork by option of defens battl and by ax of enemi oper in principl with some updat thi system of organ interwork in the defens also is deem advis for present condit thu the boyevoi ustav sukhoputnykh voysk ground troop field manual present in forc state the battalion compani command organ interwork by mission probabl ax of enemi advanc and option of subunit oper sup 33 but while the logic schemat for coordin troop combat effort in the modern defens basic remain the same the content of interwork and work method of command and staff in organ it ar chang substanti much ha appear here that is new the expans in spatial limit of battl ha a great influenc on the system of interwork thu in determin the probabl natur of enemi oper it is now no longer possibl as in the past to be limit to consid onli that enemi group directli face a format or unit proper coordin of defend troop combat effort requir anticip what personnel and equip the attack can commit in conduct not onli close combat but also long rang battl it is a question abov all of mean of nuclear attack reconnaiss strike and reconnaiss fire complex and remot minelai and ew equip the bulk of which is at the dispos of format command and is dispers at a consider distanc from the front line and in a broad zone the circumst that modern battl ha assum a land air natur also substanti affect the charact of interwork while in the world war ii period a divis command prepar calcul data for coordin troop combat effort chiefli estim the oppos enemi ground group and would estim the air situat onli in gener now when combat oper on land and in the air compris a singl whole and ar wage with ident high combat intens in coordin troop combat effort it is import to consid enemi us of tactic aviat whose scale of employ is becom ever broader as shown by the experi of nato troop exercis and oper desert storm thu a us divis is assign 120 140 sorti for a dai of battl sup 34 the land of airborn assault forc is becom massiv the us command view them as an import element in realiz the deep strike concept base on nato troop exercis experi tactic airborn land ar made to a depth of 60 70 km at brigad strength from the armi corp to 15 20 km at battalion strength from the divis and to 5 7 km at compani strength from the brigad in addit wide us of raid and reconnaiss unit is envisag for exampl up to 60 such team ar assign from each ranger battalion 24 raid and reconnaiss detach from the armi corp deep reconnaiss compani and 50 100 such detach from a special purpos team sup 35 under those condit the system for interwork of defend troop must be especi flexibl in coordin combat oper the divis command must take into account that aggress combat oper can take in the full depth of the tactic defens zone simultan from the veri begin of battl base on thi it is necessari to provid for the possibl of unit and subunit perform divers sudden mission that aris and to tie in oper of all combat format element in such a wai that thei can repel enemi strike not onli from the front but also from the flank and rear fight in encircl and combin posit and mobil form of warfar increas complex of the mine situat ha no small influenc on interwork of troop in modern battl it is common knowledg that the concept of mine warfar wa offici incorpor in us armi regul in the mid 1980 s the most import role in it wa set asid for us of remot minelai system and remot laid minefield thu accord to us command view remot laid minefield will make up 80 percent of the total volum of obstacl emplac in an air land offens oper sup 36 in coordin troop oper it is import to take into account when in what stage of battl for what purpos against what area and by what method the attack enemi mai emploi remot minelai system and accordingli think out question of how to organ observ and a mine danger warn to troop how to reconnoit remot laid minefield how to clear lane in them and also what the procedur is for restor unit and subunit combat effect after the enemi deliv a massiv fire strike by remot minelai system tactic exercis experi show that in connect with the expand spatial scope of modern battl the combin arm format command must have data on the enemi group dispos on a territori 2 3 time larger than the divis area of respons for a full situat estim in support of decisionmak and organ of interwork in short now he is oblig to keep an ey on the enemi continu not onli at the tactic but also at the oper level it stand to reason that data of the situat take shape in zone of adjac unit must be commun to the command by the adjac unit and by higher headquart the end result of the enemi estim in support of organ of interwork should be an identif of ax of hi deliveri of the main attack and other attack identif of the makeup and natur of oper by group on each axi and possibl method of hi deliveri of fire strike and execut of a maneuv of personnel and equip on the ground and by air the interest of interwork in modern defens battl demand that forecast of the natur of friendli troop oper be more comprehens and on a larger scale thi is connect with the fact that tactic depend on oper art and strategi now as never befor the divis is capabl of accomplish mani combat mission onli in close interwork with oper level asset which combat enemi aviat reconnaiss strike complex cruis missil robot weapon and ew asset disrupt hi system for command and control of troop and weapon provid reliabl air and antiland defens and so on consequ in make the decis for battl and in organ interwork the divis command should have a clear pictur of the role and place of hi format in the oper and it capabl to perform the assign combat mission and know how interwork is organ with the senior command s personnel and equip and with adjac unit especi in such matter as disrupt or weaken an enemi precis weapon strike combat hi aircraft reconnaiss airborn assault forc and ew asset conduct counterprepar

must collect gener and process approxim 4 5 time more inform than in the past war inform ha becom more complex in content and collect and evalu it requir greater effort thi is dictat by the fact that the combat oper zone of format and unit ha increas by mani time for exampl while a divis in the great patriot war defend a zone 10 12 km wide and 6 8 km deep and the area of it combat zone wa 60 100

in fig 13 fig 13 sequenc of develop question offigur 1 artilleri battalion in analyz the system of troop interwork establish in the past war it is easi to note that a certain method wa inher to it thi reflect the plan natur of conduct the offens it would begin dure breakthrough of the enemi defens with artilleri and air prepar of the assault and includ the success take of the first second and subsequ defens posit troop combat effort would build up dure the battl for them then the troop would exploit the success achiev and shift to the pursuit under favor condit fig 14 thu troop combat effort would be coordin for these and similar individu mission now the attack strive to deliv deep strike at the veri begin of battl take in the entir enemi tactic defens zone with aggress combat oper immobil all element of hi combat align transfer combat effort into the depth as quickli as possibl and establish a constantli oper front in the enemi rear by land the air echelon there and by the swift penetr of forward unit and of raid and envelop detach it is understand that thi method of the offens predetermin method of coordin combat effort of element of the combat format of combat arm unit differ than befor inasmuch as thei have to oper dispers across a broad front and to a great depth in perform divers mission a flexibl multiechelon system of interwork should correspond to that charact of the land air battl in organ it command and staff must take into account the possibl of the side deep mutual penetr conduct of battl with an invert front and a rapid abrupt transit from on kind of combat oper to anoth which predetermin continu correct of the battl plan and the system of interwork under those condit command and staff offic should displai profound tactic prudenc anticip how combat event might develop what resist the enemi will offer in the battl for a particular object and what new combat procedur and kind of weapon he mai emploi accordingli thei should determin how to us the attack and maneuv capabl of friendli combat arm more effect and how to tie their action in with each other so it is possibl to make up for weak aspect of on kind of weapon with strong aspect of other in view of the fact that frequent interrupt in the system of interwork ar possibl in the cours of battl either due to enemi effect on advanc troop or due to subordin imprecis action and inabl to organ it is import to react to situat chang exception swiftli take prompt measur prevent disrupt of the prescrib procedur for coordin action updat mission for subunit and correctli determin the primari import of a particular combat arm in achiev success so as to involv all other forc and asset in support of it oper it is imposs to ignor the fact that mani militari theoret work give the recommend that interwork in the offens should be organ in greatest detail to the depth of perform of the immedi mission sup 39 it would appear that thi approach to coordin effort doe not fulli reflect the alter condit of modern battl which ha becom deep and vast in connect with which it is difficult to factor out where the primari mission is be accomplish while in the past when the captur of enemi

undermin of the stabil of the entir defens system of an enemi format or unit major chang in the natur of modern battl dictat by employ of new weapon demand determin the sequenc of coordin troop combat effort by individu mission differ than befor thu previous organ of interwork would begin with the ty in of oper in the period of artilleri and air prepar of the assault preparatori measur preced thi were left outsid the framework of the interwork process thi wa explain by the fact that the offens against a deliber enemi defens wa carri out as a rule from a posit occupi in immedi contact with the

organ interwork with them the combin arm command indic when and against which target to deliv a strike the procedur for mutual recognit of friendli subunit and target design signal helicopt subunit can deliv simultan strike at full strength or with the bulk of forc against preassign target at a design time or success strike against target newli detect in the cours of an assault with departur on call from an alert statu at stage site from ambush or from airborn alert with a sharpli chang ground situat intens enemi electron jam and with reliabl suppress of hi air defens weapon helicopt mai carri out an independ target search target of opportun rove here is how thi wa done in exercis a pair of fire support helicopt usual wa assign for a search the distanc between them in depth wa 1 000 1 500 m with the veri same altitud on detect a target the helicopt would deliv a strike against it and if necessari would call in a reinforc element and vector it to the strike target helicopt would make a target approach from a favor direct which ensur covert of the approach reliabl detect and recognit of the target and a swift attack best condit for a surpris strike were creat with an approach to the target below the lower limit of the impact zone of air defens system which is possibl when fly at an extrem low altitud 20 30 m and take advantag of fold of the terrain with heavi enemi air defens helicopt would engag the enemi while abov friendli subunit combat format base on experi of combat oper in afghanistan combat helicopt would emploi the follow method of attack from level flight a dive or a hover an attack from level flight would be made for engag target with atgm and free flight rocket durat of the strike wa shorten and it effect wa achiev when helicopt emploi the maximum number of weapon in on pass helicopt would deliv strike without go beyond limit of the disposit of friendli subunit combat format an attack from a dive wa execut for hit target with free flight rocket but here the rang to the target did not exce 1 000 1 500 m with weak opposit from enemi air defens weapon such an attack wa us to hit target situat in fold of the terrain in shelter and behind revers hillslop i e when an attack from level flight prove imposs a helicopt attack from a hover is the most effect in a hover mode the helicopt can emploi all kind of weapon atgm free flight rocket and conduct machinegun fire the helicopt must chang it posit after each launch in a hover mode the experi of the great patriot war and local war show that greatest difficulti in maintain interwork ar creat dure battl in the depth of the enemi defens which is character by unpredict of the develop of event and the frequent appear of crisi situat far from everyth can be anticip in advanc in oper of combat format element and combat arm befor the begin of an offens therefor on must be readi for the fact that in the cours of battl it will be necessari to substanti correct or even creat the system of interwork anew more than onc it can be expect that as attack troop wedg into the defens the enemi will step up resist and do everyth possibl to local the penetr therefor in the cours of battl there will be a stubborn contest of the side in build up combat effort under such condit preempt the enemi in maneuv and in deliv fire strike and disrupt hi plan ar of great import it is import not to give him an opportun to restor a disrupt fire and obstacl plan or to carri out a plan redeploy of personnel and asset later and out of the depth success perform of these and other mission by the attack troop larg depend on coordin of their oper by object place and time it is especi import to achiev precis and cohes of troop oper in build up combat effort on a decis axi i e where success ha appear abov all a command must decid on the method by which he should strive to continu maintain decis superior over the enemi on the main axi it is common knowledg that in world war ii essenti the onli method of build up effort wa to commit second echelon or reserv now the prevail place is held by fire strike of reconnaiss strike and reconnaiss fire complex missil troop and aviat and by artilleri fire the advantag of thi method li in swift of execut in addit at the present time there ha been a consider expans in troop capabl for build up effort by emploi airborn assault forc and airmobil subunit land in the depth of the enemi defens right after fire strike thei ar capabl of quickli exploit their result captur tactic import area road junction command height pass built up area cross over water obstacl and therebi prevent the approach of enemi reserv and contribut to exploit of the success of first echelon unit at crisi moment of battl when there is the threat that the offens will lose steam or even be disrupt the command will have to us all forc and asset at hi dispos to retain the initi i e he must build up effort both by a maneuv of fire as well as by commit of the second echelon or reserv and if possibl also by land an assault forc in the enemi rear it is necessari to achiev coordin deliveri of strike against the defens simultan from the ground and air and from the front flank and rear in order to dissip the enemi s attent and effort thi is a difficult task by the time the second echelon is commit the situat often can becom critic as a result of the enemi s deliveri of a surpris stun strike it is not preclud that command and control will be disrupt and that some unit and subunit will lose combat effect under those condit step ar taken abov all to determin the true statu of troop and restor disrupt command and control the combat mission is updat for the command of the subunit be commit and he is also told the point of commit to battl rout and time for move to it and procedur for fire support and interwork with first echelon subunit if an airborn assault forc is land in the enemi rear and the dispatch of a raid detach is plan simultan with commit of the second echelon then their oper ar coordin by object place and time under favor condit it is advis to creat smoke screen to ensur conceal of the second echelon s commit the procedur for emploi smoke can vari blind smoke screen in support of assault motor rifl and tank subunit usual ar laid down by artilleri in terrain sector easili view from the enemi s side at the point of commit to battl blind of the defend s antitank weapon and tank by artilleri smoke projectil should begin 3 5 minut befor the end of a fire assault and end with the arriv of assault subunit at the final coordin line conceal smoke screen can be emplac in the cours of battl by the assault subunit themselv to hamper oper of enemi antitank helicopt and also to conceal a maneuv smoke gener begin with the subunit arriv in the impact zone of enemi atgm or at the final coordin line when the subunit approach the smoke screen line smoke gener ceas and the assault is carri out the experi of local war show that the effect of emploi enemi antitank weapon is reduc by 3 5 time with skill us of conceal smoke screen and by 10 15 time when us blind screen it is advis to us smoke asset suddenli across a broad front with consider of terrain and weather condit in conduct battl in the depth of the enemi defens motor rifl and tank unit should interwork with aviat with special precis the fact is that in a number of case becaus of a lag artilleri will be the onli mean of troop support coordin of air and ground strike on the battlefield is manifest in distribut target between artilleri and aviat in establish the prioriti of attack between aircraft and helicopt and in design line of respons safeti measur ar strictli observ in coordin combat effort of motor rifl and tank unit and artilleri with aviat the principl implement is that aviat attack those target whose destruct by ground troop weapon is hamper or imposs ground and air strike ar ti in by time and line effort of artilleri combat helicopt and aircraft ar separ by time and line dure the dai the line of permiss air attack come closer to the feba and at night it pull back aircraft and helicopt flight ar stagger in altitud and thei ar assign rout by a joint air traffic control center fire support of front aviat combat helicopt and artilleri is direct accord to a schedul compil and coordin in detail experi gain in local war and tactic exercis permit draw certain conclus with respect to characterist shortcom allow by combin arm command in organ and accomplish interwork with aviat abov all there often is a tendenc to dissip air effort to combat numer small target instead of concentr strike against the most import object sometim the role of long rang artilleri is impos on combat aircraft i e thei ar assign mission for engag target situat at a shallow depth the principl of economi of alloc air sorti is not alwai adher to thei ar quickli us up when unit perform the immedi mission and no sorti remain for support subsequ oper it also often happen that have call in aircraft to deliv a strike against on target the combin arm command chang their mission and strike target when aircraft appear over the battlefield as a result of which neither mission is execut a shortcom such as poor intellig support to aviat also is typic the air command element often is forc to conduct reconnaiss for itself and to concern itself with vector aircraft to design target and about their mark in conclus we will dwell on certain featur of interwork in a meet engag abov all we will note that usual it is organ under condit of extrem limit time dure the march which requir high effici and cohes in work of command and staff and swift and precis of troop oper gener principl for organ interwork ar the veri same as in the offens the distinct is that mission for unit and subunit and the system of interwork must be updat more often special attent in coordin troop combat effort is given to preempt the enemi in deploi open fire and execut a maneuv conclus and recommend 1 the principl of interwork is on of the fundament principl of combin arm battl it indic that to achiev the assign goal to defeat the enemi it is necessari to ensur precis oper of all personnel and asset particip in the battl strictli coordin by mission ax line time and method of conduct battl 2 organ and accomplish of interwork is a complex mani side

will mount an expedit to the site of the disast involv the russian nuclear power submarin komsomolet which sank in the norwegian sea in april 1989 the purpos of the two month expedit aboard the research ship akademik keldysh is to seal the torpedo tube hatch the submarin ha two torpedo on board with nuclear warhead and these fill specialist with the greatest apprehens the deputi minist said it is imposs to rule out in principl a possibl spread of radioact as a result of corros of their case he believ at the veri same time academician vladimir zuyev depart head at the russian academi of scienc institut of oceanolog ha sent a letter to the russian presid s staff he report that despit the real possibl of a vollei discharg of weapon grade plutonium into the marin environ from the sunken komsomolet the expedit to it and the actual seal of the vessel ar in jeopardi lead specialist with rich experi of underwat work have been taken off it the necessari ecolog expert apprais ha not been carri out there is no feder program for the reliabl corros proof of an increas sourc of radioact danger and the necessari financi resourc have not yet been alloc to thi what is the problem here why doe the situat with regard to the sunken komsomolet elicit such increas attent and such contradictori assess sever nuclear power ship have sunk in recent year and so much radioact wast ha been dump in the ocean that the possibl of a leak of plutonium from two torpedo appear a mere trifl compar with the constant discharg of radiat from these graveyard dr of technic scienc tengiz borisov former chairman of the committe for carri out special purpos underwat work whose function have now been transfer to the ministri for emerg situat believ that thi is not quit the case the question of ensur the komsomolet radiat safeti is far more seriou than other similar tragic instanc there ar sever reason first the submarin li off the coast of norwai in norwai s tradit fish ground the discharg of plutonium into the water and trace of it were alreadi detect last year although thei do not yet exce the background valu could depriv that countri of fisheri for hundr of year destroi the modern fish process industri depriv ten of thousand of peopl of their livelihood and as a consequ drastic undermin russia s prestig and forc it to pai compens run into mani million in foreign currenc second russia it leadership and it specialist still have the technic and econom possibl of prevent the radiat pollut of the ocean corros proof the sunken vessel and deliv europ from the threat of an ecolog disast but preciou time must not be lost here we ar left with virtual the last chanc of carri out the work thi summer there will not be anoth opportun the torpedo beryllium case ar bound to break up within the next few month and then all effort will be in vain true not all the specialist familiar with the situat on the submarin share the anxieti of tengiz borisov hi colleagu at the institut of oceanolog or other scientist and practic underwat worker some of them mainli employe of the ministri for emerg situat maintain that fish is not conduct at a depth of 1 700 meter where the komsomolet li and so there is simpli no threat that plutonium will get into the fish diet and thenc onto peopl s tabl in addit thei sai in the opinion of nuclear scientist at the scientif research institut of experiment physic at arzama 16 where the torpedo nuclear warhead were creat the discharg of plutonium follow the destruct of the torpedo case will not have appreci radiat consequ either for the popul or for the fauna if a 100 percent discharg doe occur all the materi will settl in a compact stain between 30 and 400 km long at the same time the radiat dose will be virtual insignific at the far limit of the seat of radiat the izvestiya editori offic ha a copi of thi opinion of the scientif research institut of experiment physic approv by academician yurii trutnev and stanislav voronin of the russian academi of scienc the chief design of nuclear warhead it conclus do not coincid with those reach at the ministri for emerg situat it is not yet clear the scientist write whether the uncertainti that exist at the present time in the estim of seab pollut by the fission product of plutonium corros can affect the global conclus that the escap of plutonium from the nuclear weapon as their insul case is destroi ha no appreci radioact consequ further it is necessari to make a more detail assess of the possibl movement of plutonium from the bed to surfac layer as a consequ of the season migrat of plankton which winter on the bed and the compet process of spread of the plankton patch on the lift of plutonium build up from seab deposit if we translat the scientist word into simpl languag understand to everyon it becom clear that larg area of plankton plaster with the decomposit product of nuclear warhead or rather precis plutonium have zero buoyanc thei can be move by underwat current ani distanc from the scene of the tragedi and thu end up ultim in the food of someon live thousand of kilomet from the norwegian sea the academician believ that it would be prematur to conclud that in work with the nuclear power submarin komsomolet it is possibl to confin ourselv just to radiat monitor everyth must be done to make naval weapon system safe bear the possibl of accid in mind a similar conclus wa reach by the russian secur council interdepartment commiss on ecolog safeti which discuss thi problem at the end of last year what then is prevent thi from be done todai particularli as the ministri for emerg situat as sergei khetagurov declar is readi and ha plan to carri out the special expedit to seal the stricken submarin in the opinion of mani specialist with whom i have spoken about thi work on corros proof the sunken submarin is be hinder by department differ and by ambit which no less than the actual corros ar eat awai at formerli amic and unit collect the peopl who last year organ and carri out the uniqu deep water experi in the norwegian sea who ascertain and analyz the actual condit of the sunken vessel and it system and who us uniqu underwat robot to peep insid the komsomolet propos their own program for corros proof it pack the torpedo compart with a special sorbent isol it from seab current by mean of metal cover with rubber seal and in addit give the ministri for emerg situat disinterest assist in implement it and work on the expedit on a voluntari basi but there wa not even a repli to their appeal at the same time the new structur of the ministri for emerg situat which have never befor encount such complex underwat work ar acut short of such specialist yet in mani case thei antagon former employe of the committe for carri out special purpos underwat work and other organ there is veri littl time left until the start of the expedit it will be veri difficult dure the remain dai to make up for what ha been neglect dure the preced month ship with deep water apparatu on board could be delai from put to sea becaus ecolog expertis and monei ar lack and all the necessari equip ha still to be prepar the favor weather in the ocean will pass then will come new interdepartment accus a search for guilti parti who will benefit from thi expert of my acquaint believ that in the interest of the get the job done the department differ and ambit must be overcom and discard we must not reject anybodi s help becaus too much is at stake not onli the countri s prestig but also peopl s health there is an extrem great need todai for a govern program for the corros proof of the sunken submarin a program approv by the presid and with power to involv all the necessari organ and structur in thi oper we must not put our trust in foreign assist we ourselv ar capabl of rectifi what we have done thi is now becom a matter of honor for the countri and it specialist

thei won t eat the leather oceanograph ballard in lo angel to announc that he will host a televis seri about underwat explor and other scientif ventur is somewher in the middl of a long explan about why he pursu the sunken past with such avid partli he conced it s for the sensat that onli discoveri can provid the moment of discoveri i think the thrill of explor is to see someth to be the first to set ey on someth that ha never been seen befor he sai the first time i saw the titan wow there it wa thi monstrou ship just came out of the gloom and there it wa for ballard the moment of discoveri is intellectu kinet an instant when he connect palpabl with histori the best experi that i can give that s sort of an analog is like go to custer s last stand he sai to go and stand where custer stood and imagin you know bad dai to be in the cavalri that s the sens it s your hallow ground you sens crazi hors there and you just realiz the hopeless of the situat well when you re out at the titan and all of a sudden it happen right here it s no longer abstract unknown territori scientif and histor ha been ballard s countri for more than two decad perhap even as far back as hi childhood in southern california when he wa smitten by account of african explor and becam captiv by the pacif ocean now four year after the discoveri of the titan catapult him from mere well known scientist to global fame the 47 year old seem to be in the throe of anoth transform thi time around he appar is eager to shape both the futur and the past with the technolog that he develop in more than a decad of underwat explor furthermor he plan to us hi new tool as the new host of nation geograph explor a weekli two hour program produc by nation geograph and turner broadcast system inc it is the kind of popular of scienc that ballard ha been critic for in the past by hi peer but ballard sai he see hi metamorphosi into tv person as an educ mission that mai help convinc children that scienc is a contact sport discuss the search for the bismarck ballard obvious savor the contact with histori and scienc becaus the bismarck wa engag in a run battl hundr of mile from land when it sank neither the british nor the german were abl or much interest in keep precis record of their locat so ballard s expedit had to search about 150 squar mile of ocean floor initi with sonar and then with remot control computer robot sensor and camera control from a surfac ship befor locat the wreck june 8 thi kind of explor isn t cheap ballard note joke that we had 100 000 pound of equip and 10 van and six robot and a partridg in a pear tree you have to understand that the bismarck battl wa wage in a forc 8 sea 50 knot wind 15 foot wave with overcast and no celesti navig ballard sai the search for the bismarck which like the titan sank on it maiden voyag wa further complic by the natur of the atlant ocean the battleship wa in 16 000 feet of water and it wa in a mountain rang ballard sai not without enthusiasm it wa in an aw place and it wa in the northern latitud up at 48 degre north latitud which is not a nice stretch of ocean ever even in the summer despit the difficulti ballard wa drawn to the wreck becaus like the titan it is on of the most famou lost chunk of histori to litter the ocean floor i do it becaus of the challeng to do it he sai but i m also interest in the fact that thi ship is well preserv there is probabl more histori preserv in the deep ocean of the world than in all the museum of the world although it ha lost it gun turret and wa hit by numer shell and torpedo the bismarck still ha touch of fresh ballard add cite the huge paint swastika on the ship s bow and stern in it dai the 50 000 ton bismarck with heavi armor eight 15 inch gun capabl of fire on ton shell 24 mile and high perform diesel engin wa on of the most power warship afloat and briefli it prove to be just that slip out of it home port of danzig now gdynia on mai 18 1941 to attack alli convoi the bismarck soon had much of the british royal navi look for it at the time england face a victori germani alon and wa depend on convoi from america for most of it food and war materi discov by two british heavi cruiser on mai 23 the bismarck wa engag the next dai by two other british warship from a distanc of 25 000 yard the bismarck s huge shell hit the hood start a fire in an ammunit locker within minut the hood explod kill all but three of the ship s 1 400 crew member the princ of wale wa also damag of the bismarck the british were lucki to get it to the bottom ballard claim in the climact battl a freak hit by a torpedo launch from a vintag world war i biplan knock out the bismarck s steer forc the crippl battleship to wait for the british to come and get it of cours the british came and the bismarck wa sunk in the atlant about 600 mile west of franc sinc the discoveri of the bismarck ballard sai there ha been curios about what actual caus the ship to sink british firepow or scuttl by her own crew but ballard believ the evid make the point moot the british warship had order to sink the bismarck not captur it and the german were under order not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war prize he sai at 10 a m on mai 27 the captain of the bismarck order hi crew to open the seacock on hi disabl ship thu flood the hull ballard recount about 10 30 a m the bismarck wa hit by three torpedo from the british cruiser dorsetshir and sank three minut later bismarck s survivor so it wa on it wai down and the torpedo help but it wa on it wai down ballard sai if thei hadn t open the seacock i m convinc the british would have sat there and plunk torpedo into it until it sank so it s sort of academ who sank it onli about 100 of the bismarck s crew surviv nearli 2 300 perish includ sever hundr who were swim in the water after their ship disappear it is that moment that seem to galvan ballard when the bismarck sank approxim 800 live soul went into the water and were aliv after the ship went under he sai lean forward in hi chair and the dorsetshir came in and began pick up survivor and then someon thought thei saw a periscop and thei took off and thei left 700 peopl in the water aliv can you imagin the aw the hopeless the despair of the sailor who s just had a ship blown out from underneath him he s paddl and freez to death in thi water and salvat is right there and he s grab hold of the hull and the ship take off ballard ha said he will not reveal the exact locat of the bismarck except to german author as a ship of war the battleship belong to germani he sai although there might be some debat about which half of that divid countri would have the more legitim claim as with the titan ballard sai he strongli believ that such rel recent wreck should be left undisturb memori to those who perish as for wreck from the dim reach of the past ballard argu that thei should be explor onli by qualifi archeologist intent on broaden histor knowledg in fact he still becom visibl angri that privat expedit to the titan took some artifact from the wreck develop deep sea robot but ballard seem to be chiefli an enthusiast not a critic in particular he is a propon of machin especi robot ballard ha head up the develop of a system of deep sea unman robot call the argo jason system equip with camera and other sens devic the robot ar now capabl of plumb the world s deep water faster and more safe than the tini slow man submarin that previous were the cut edg of ocean research and explor he sai while an unman robot name jason jr wa us in a 1986 expedit to the titan it wa onli within the last few month that the leap wa made to fulli robot explor ballard sai mean that robot can now be direct from a surfac ship rather than from a man submarin via a control cabl it s a relief that he and other won t have to spend five or more hour per dai commut to the ocean floor which averag 12 000 feet in depth he sai even though he ha spent a lot of time in cramp research submarin and probabl will spend more ballard is mif by the ineffici of the romant littl gui refer to the small submarin he explain you re spend five hour a dai freez to death in thi littl sphere our averag dive time on the titan wa three hour a dai three hour out of 24 and you ve got 50 peopl and you ve got on gui look out of a window more interest in scienc ballard ha been talk about the potenti of thi technolog for year but recent advanc have made him more convinc than ever that the concept of telepres will revolution not onli undersea explor but the wai mani peopl travel more import he see the technolog as capabl of rekindl interest in scienc among american schoolchildren we re now reach a point in technolog in imag devic both acoust and visual fiber optic

where i don t feel profession inconvenienc by live in montana how much time he actual will spend in northern montana is an open question though given the demand of the explor televis seri with the
