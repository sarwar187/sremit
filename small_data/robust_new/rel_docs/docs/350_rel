thi action is taken in respons to user anxieti express over possibl hazard effect of an electromagnet wave on human bodi the associ s member firm will self impos the standard on product destin for the domest market sweden s mpr ii standard is us as refer in formul the regul target product ar crt and liquid crystal displai the question of possibl hazard effect of low frequenc electromagnet interfer on human bodi gener by comput displai had surfac mani time dure the past 10 year or more until now howev no definit conclus ha been offer perhap it is not the type of question which can yield a clear cut conclus under such circumst a short cut to dispel user anxieti is to control a level of emiss of low frequenc electromagnet interfer consid hazard to health in octob 1993 jeida and japan busi machin maker associ establish a guidelin concern low frequenc electromagnet interfer gener by displai us in inform process equip hereinaft refer to as the guidelin the guidelin design allow emiss level to control the intens of electromagnet interfer gener by comput displai the establish guidelin is applic not onli to crt but also to liquid crystal and plasma displai measur procedur and condit of electr and magnet interfer also will be regul applic of guidelin will begin in 1996 in stage japan electron industri develop associ will treat the guidelin as the industri s self impos regulatori control for now firm which ar member of the associ will self impos the guidelin on their product sold on the domest market ampl time is allow befor the regulatori guidelin becom effect it ha been state that the guidelin will be applic onli to those product manufactur after januari 1996 after januari 1998 howev all product ar said to be subject to the regulatori guidelin in octob 1991 moreov the jeida ha establish a standard regul displai s static electr at that time the electron industri associ of japan s name appear as on of those involv in develop specif in establish a standard thi time howev jeida ha defer the particip of the electron industri associ of japan japan try to catch up with us and europ japan lag somewhat behind the unit state and europ in the regulatori aspect of handl low frequenc electromagnet interfer in the unit state and europ it is becom a common practic for both end user and comput maker to ensur that product satisfi design emiss level in accord with the establish regul similar to japan s guidelin mpr ii establish by sweden s offici organ swedac swedish board for technic accredit is the standard most frequent consult especi in europ thi is becom essenti to the point that no matter how inexpens product ar the market demand that product adher to the standard establish by mpr ii accord to a technician work for a displai maker although the number of mpr ii product for the domest market ha been increas in japan still there ar a larg number of product to which no standard ha been appli on of the reason is that japanes user ar not as demand in thi respect as their european and american counterpart howev the situat mai chang overnight anticip thi the jeida made a move to establish a guidelin lenient on regul of electr field emiss in mani wai the guidelin follow mpr ii mpr ii standard product therefor will be automat given the seal of approv the low frequenc rang of electr and magnet field allow by the regul as well as the method of measur basic is the same as those of mpr ii level of electr interfer allow by the japanes guidelin and mpr ii howev differ wide those establish by japan electron industri develop associ ar 50v m or 250v m with band i 5hz 2khz and 10v m for band ii 2khz 400khz which ar consider more lenient than the mpr ii design valu of 25v m band i and 2 5v m band ii the associ s target valu for band i vari depend on whether ground is possibl or not the target valu for the magnet field ar the same as mpr ii in set the allow level of interfer japan electron industri develop associ consid standard movement other than mpr ii at present the unit state s ieee institut of electr and electron engin inc and europ s ecma european comput manufactur associ ar studi similar guidelin the associ us the figur appear in a draft of the ecma 172 standard differ between the japan electron industri develop associ s standard and mpr ii li in cost involv to achiev target valu the target valu of mpr ii ha been determin by consid two factor that it is within the rang of the technic feasibl and that thi can be achiev without spend a substanti amount sinc effect of electromagnet interfer on human bodi is not clear at thi time the target valu ar determin pure on a technic basi the target valu establish by japan electron industri develop associ ar aim for the level which enabl japan to manufactur displai at lower cost than that of the mpr ii product even at these target valu sinc thei ar substanti lower than the standard set in field other than displai we believ that it will be easi for jeida to achiev it goal reason why onli the target valu of electr interfer ar set high is electr interfer is more difficult to mitig than magnet interfer a technician from a displai maker in order to control electr interfer gener by displai we have either to lower intern gener electr interfer itself or to us shield for instanc with crt we can us a shield method by mix coat with a conduct materi and appli it to a tube surfac howev thi method can be extrem costli if materi with superior shield characterist ar to be develop refer 1 nakamori imai eda technolog gentl to human bodi reexamin effect of electromagnet wave

to the back of the desk and the keyboard is set in front of them the printer end up wherev it will fit within stretch distanc of the umbil cabl link it to the comput sever thing can be wrong with that scenario accord to recommend adopt by the american nation standard institut the basic ergonom principl endors by ansi ar easi to describ you should sit upright with your feet flat on the floor and

135 degre is accept for keyboard work howev medic and ergonom expert that i have work with sai 90 degre is the optimum further you should not have to look up at ani part of your displai screen the top part of the screen not the case should be no higher than ey level depend on your size it mai be difficult to achiev that optimum posit you also need to have enough room under the desk or tabl for your knee and feet prefer a space at least 24 inch wide and from 19 to 24 inch deep depend on how long your leg ar the foundat for a good comput work space is a good adjust chair a secretari style chair is

chair can be adjust for seat height back support and tilt angl the minimum rang of height adjust should be from 16 to 20 5 inch accord to the ansi standard seat width should be at least 18 2 inch and the width of the lower back support should be at least 12 inch the standard make no recommend for height of the seat back chair that have pneumat tube for height adjust ar easier to us but mai tend to lose pressur and sink while you ar seat unless the qualiti is veri good chair that us screw for mechan adjust ar more difficult to chang but stai where you put them chair adjust is critic becaus that
