sandinist and counterrevolutionari in sapoa who establish fundament factor to achiev the strateg defeat of foreign aggress i must tell you that the strateg defeat of the reagan plan wa but the revolut s militari triumph without which for exampl instead of a sandinist militari command todai we would have a somozist command or the counterrevolut of past year within the framework of the sapoa

peac and rancor free process precis in respons to thi polit polar it wa a highli polar and veng elector victori in march 1990 a transit agreement wa sign by the revolut and the govern elect thi agreement prevent nicaragua from enter a cours of chao and anarchi that would lead to anoth civil war which unquestion would have been bloodier than the previou on at that time it would have been veri difficult to view civilian militari relat in the light which we ar begin to view them now nicaragua is current in the process of legitim the armi despit those peopl who still believ it is possibl to alter the cours of thi histor trend in nicaragua we cannot ignor the fact that some peopl cannot or do not want to understand that to chang thi situat in ani wai would be to set nicaragua onc again on the path to the profoundest instabl therefor the armi s legitimaci should be the gradual result of a broad consensu and it matur should be the result of the effort by all forc of the nation to ensur that the armi truli is a nation armi that repres all nicaraguan it must be understood that the armi is no longer the express of a polit parti the sandinist front as it wa in the past it is no longer

that even some econom analyst have made seriou mistak on of them recent point out that nicaragua s problem wa the armi becaus it ha sought to block the govern s econom program at ani cost i am convinc that a countri s econom and social problem must not be perceiv from a repress point of view much less must on adher to the reason that in order to implement a specif plan be it neoliber or not it is

backward and the underdevelop of a nation that lack democrat experi and urgent need a solid materi basi in order to advanc toward a truli democrat cultur from anoth perspect the main problem li with
