from a special lectur at the kyushu energi institut on 13 april 1993 by takuyoshi fukumoto proton medic research center univers of tsukuba text i introduct cancer is a highli complic diseas which complet differ in characterist from such diseas as tuberculosi which formerli wa call the nation diseas of japan or more recent aid accord to the scienc and technolog in the year 2020 which wa a survei studi of anticip technolog publish by the scienc and technolog agenc in decemb 1992 tremend effort have been made to develop anti cancer drug and great expect ar held for futur develop up to thi point in time howev drug have been larg ineffect for solid cancer and extern surgeri and radiat proton and electron continu to hold an import role in actual treatment there ar some cancer cell that have a high resist to radiat treatment and becaus thi resist is consid to be a caus of recurr acceler neutron beam have strong physiolog effect ar consid a more effect form of radiat and ar gain greater us at the nation institut of radiolog scienc nir at the medic scienc research laboratori tokyo univers as well as in europ and the unit state as a part of the 1976 bicentenni independ memori activ in the unit state particl beam therapi research for the elimin of cancer wa undertaken us sup meson and heavi ion beam more than 10 year ago in japan the scienc and technolog agenc commiss a survei studi by the japan radiolog societi relat to medic us of acceler as on link in the peac us of atom energi select from sup neg pi meson and heavi ion the latter wa given prioriti as the radiat for the 21st centuri base on thi polici the heavi ion synchrotron himac is current under construct at the nation institut of radiolog scienc nir and the goal is to begin treatment of patient from the 1994 fiscal year elsewher massachusett gener hospit mgh is us the synchrotron at harvard univers and excel result have been shown in the proton beam treatment of certain kind of retin cancer from the result of these facil the tsukuba univers particl beam medic center wa establish in 1980 and experiment treatment began in 1983 thi facil us the 500 mev proton beam from the booster synchrotron at the nation laboratori for high energi physic kek and in 1990 thi center wa reorgan into the current research center for the medic us of proton beam becaus posit result ar be obtain which reflect on the kind of deep cancer such as liver cancer which continu to afflict mani japanes thi survei of the current trend in particl beam treatment place the emphasi on proton beam therapi ii special characterist of particl beam seen from the perspect of cancer treatment let and bragg peak when x rai and electron penetr into water or into the human bodi the water molecul along that path undergo electrolyt dissoci or excit thi electrolyt dissoci or excit is the principl effect by which the radiat beam affect the live bodi nuclear reaction have a vastli smaller cross section area and have been found to contribut littl the unit length along the rout of the radiat beam per energi given is call let linear energi transfer in x rai and electron which ar the convent form of therapeut radiat the dosag given attenu almost exponenti as it progress through the bodi from the point of irradi except for high energi x rai buildup becaus radiat sensit depend on the kind of tissu and cancer treatment must of cours be studi individu gener howev the dosag distribut in which the dosag administ near the surfac of the bodi attenu almost exponenti the deeper it goe is inappropri for deeper cancer thu at hospit varieg radiat from differ direct is perform by a lineac mount on a rotat gantri and the dosag on the skin is lower while concentr the dosag on the cancer proton and particl with heavier electr charg includ sup have a rang that correspond to their energi when penetr into water and thei have a larg electrolyt dissoci action that is call the bragg peak near the terminu of that rang from the point of entri through to thi bragg peak is a region of nearli fix electrolyt dissoci action and is call a plateau as r wilson propos in 1946 if proton energi is select such that the bragg peak agre with the cancer it would be possibl to administ the dosag necessari for treatment of that cancer while do veri littl damag to normal cell figur 1 graphic capt figur 1 comparison of dosag distribut when proton beam x rai g rai and electron beam pass through tissu graphic from the result of research at uppsala sweden etc the let of proton is lower than that of neutron and heavi ion and it wa clarifi that the physiolog effect rbe rel biolog effect is almost equal to that of convent radiat ordinarili rbe is express by the dosag ratio of the proton or other particl beam and sup 60 co or x rai in which 10 percent of the irradi cell surviv figur 2 the larger the surviv fraction of cell at low dosag the larger thi dosag ratio in low let radiat curv part appear on the recoveri in the low dosag region as indic in the surviv curv of figur 2 and becaus there is no recoveri in high let radiat the surviv curv becom a straight line graphic capt figur 2 cell surviv curv when irradi with neutron and x rai of differ energi graphic there is someth in cancer cell that show a strong resist to convent radiat and thi is thought to be a caus of recurr after a part ha gotten well by radiat therapi moreov the radiat resist of cell depend on the oxygen concentr of the environ which surround the cell and it is known that when cancer cell ar in a low oxygen state the resist to radiat becom stronger oer oxygen enhanc ratio particl beam with a high let also have a high rbe and the capac by which cancer cell ar injur is not affect by the oxygen concentr to the same degre as in convent radiat consequ it is thought that high let particl beam ar probabl more effect on radiat resist cancer thu even though thei ar not electr charg particl beam high let acceler neutron beam ar us in

acceler neutron is not greatli differ from convent radiat and attenu almost exponenti in the bodi acceler neutron beam therapi wa conduct at berkelei even befor the war but all the patient di after the war thei were begun again at hammersmith hospit in england and becaus posit result were report the special cyclotron at nir and at the medic scienc research laboratori univers of tokyo were introduc in japan and therapi began be conduct howev a signific differ in effect compar to convent radiat wa found onli in cancer of extrem limit posit such as salivari gland pancoast lung cancer and the prostat gland etc up to thi point approxim 10 000 peopl in the world have receiv acceler neutron therapi but compar to convent radiat it is said that there is greater tardiv injuri and these clinic result strongli suggest the effect of high let radiat treatment have alreadi been termin at the medic scienc research laboratori univers of tokyo iv proton beam proton beam belong to low let

linda univers at the request of the fermi nation acceler laboratori construct a dedic us proton therapi devic whose princip acceler is a compact synchrotron and us for therapi began in 1990 current the form of the acceler is adapt to target prostat cancer a 200 mev synchrocyclotron in orthez franc wa complet convert from nuclear physic research to medic us and proton beam therapi began from 1992 melanoma of the retina is treat at sever locat such as the psi paul scherrer institut in switzerland origin the purpos of the kek facil wa to verifi the efficaci of proton beam and now that thi ha been verifi it is highli desir to build a new dedic us facil howev the greatest problem is that both the scale and budget for such a facil is markedli larger compar to convent medic equip a synchrotron cyclotron or lineac ar all acceler capabl of produc for thi amount of energi the strength of the beam necessari for therapi is about 10 na the high strength beam acceler of a lineac is capabl of thi but becaus high frequenc equip is expens a uniqu synchrotron wa design at tsukuba univers with the cooper of kek subsequ in futur attempt to control a three dimension beam the manufactur is studi the develop of a commerci system which add a rotat gantri to a compact cyclotron v neg pi meson a star a star occur when sup is absorb by the nucleu the nucleu divid and sever lightweight particl ar emit in a radial shape is produc when sup energi is absorb by the atom nuclei compos the human bodi such as c o and n and a mass of 140 mev is convert to energi becaus sup is a larg emit energi it wa expect to have superior result and clinic research wa be conduct at all three of the world s meson site name lo alamo in the unit state and psi and triumf in vancouv in japan dr yukawa predict that meson radiat will gain social support as a clinic therapi howev at lo alamo thi radiat wa evalu as not have the same efficaci as convent radiat and as indic in tabl 1 thei quickli termin research the other two facil ar continu and psi is combin thi with proton beam therapi and triumf is plan to do the same becaus sup is a secondari particl that is produc by high energi proton or electron strike a target the strength of the beam is weak becaus it must be concentr in a beam poor in mass converg is poor and becaus the radiat time is long and their lifetim is short at 2 6 x 10 8 s sever limit ar impos on the radiat system furthermor when star ar produc there is high probabl that two neutron ar releas and in that case the dosag doe not concentr in the cancer 6 heavi ion biolog and cancer treatment research us particl beam ha been conduct at lbl lawrenc berkelei laboratori for a long time progress ha been made in clinic research us ne in the heavi ion synchrotron bevalac becaus thei have both a high let and a bragg peak heavi ion includ ne ar consid to be the ideal radiat which combin both a good dosag distribut and efficaci in relat to cancer with high radiat resist therefor the scienc and technolog agenc is construct a heavi particl beam cancer treatment devic at nir as a part of it anti cancer 10 year plan and clinic research is to begin from the 1994 fiscal year the result of ne thu far have not alwai been satisfactori and becaus the bevalac close down in februari 1993 as previous describ and a proton beam facil is be plan for sacramento the nir facil will be the onli heavi ion clinic research facil in the world and it result will be close watch 7 conclus in order to make radiat treatment of cancer more effect neutron proton sup and heavi ion research ar be conduct in addit to convent proton and electron research and from the rapid increas of facil that have recent begun treatment proton beam therapi is take root as the next gener of practic radiat around the world there ar plan for at least 10 facil at mgh uc davi cancer center and tsukuba univers etc and it is highli desir to develop a medic dedic us proton beam facil that fulfil the difficult condit of compact size low cost and high reliabl final i would like to take the opportun of thi present to give heartfelt thank to director yoshihisa wakuto and manag masaji saka of the kyushu energi institut which provid the opportun for thi present and to offic manag moriyama and all relat parti of the kyushu atom energi forum postscript at the 18th ptcog confer conven 15 19
