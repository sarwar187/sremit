LA022690-0044: ag mark spitz ey renew olymp glori the afternoon sun no longer cover lane 8 of the ucla pool when mark spitz three dai past 40 jump in to swim it wa cold and dark in hi column of water not a particularli good dai for swim or dream spitz put in 40 minut which is a fine workout for a man near middl ag but a littl on the light side for a futur olympian then he laid hi head back as if the water were hi pillow slowli close hi ey and puf out hi cheek moment later hi ey blink open to see two peopl stand on the deck peer down at him my arm he said feel like lead he putter around anoth moment or two then made up hi mind that the 1992 summer olymp were far enough awai that on thi dai in februari 1990 he could afford to get out of the water well i ve got 862 dai left he said final manag a smile and the workout wa over come back to the water after 17 year on land is not easi mark spitz is learn last summer spitz america s most famou swimmer and the not altogeth belov winner of seven gold medal at the 1972 munich olymp decid he want to becom a member of the 1992 us olymp team in barcelona last septemb word got out and a giddi sens of anticip envelop the swim world spitz swam for an hour grant an interview for an hour swam anoth hour grant anoth interview and so forth it s been a headi time but it s also sober spitz injur hi chronic bad back spent sever week recuper at home and about six week out of the water too much too soon he said as he talk hi hand tri to coax the pain out of hi left hamstr he isn t even attempt to swim hi chosen olymp stroke the butterfli for a few more week it s all such a chore that with a chuckl he said the most difficult part is leav himself enough energi for the 10 minut walk home through the ucla campu to hi singl level four bedroom brick home in plush holmbi hill and yet spitz is undaunt he said he most definit will get back into shape after do littl more than walk the dog and sail for the better part of two decad he believ he can swim as fast as he did in 1972 when he set the world record in the 100 meter butterfli as well as three other individu event he believ he can make an olymp team full of swimmer half hi ag and he is not go to give up come what mai i want thi he said in an interview befor a recent practic as a kid i end up in the sport of swim through osmosi i went out sort of swam wa on a team i got better i got good i got great then i held world record i never had a chanc to sit back and reflect what would i be do if i wasn t do thi now i ve elect to actual do it there s a differ when you want to do someth you want it more not that i didn t want it then but now i want it even more when he announc hi intent to make the olymp team at ag 42 the pictur that went with all the stori show a bronz sculpt spitz jet black hair slick back by the water a man unchang by time except for the mustach which is long gone in realiti there s grai in that black hair quit a bit of it for a 40 year old spitz is in wonder shape and still possess the great swimmer s bodi arm that go on forev attach to a torso so long hi head hit the roof when he sit in the car make it appear he is 6 feet 4 not a gener 6 1 but when he walk out of the locker room in hi swim suit after all the ucla swimmer have pass by it s evid time take it toll on everybodi he look a littl thick doesn t he said mark wallac on of spitz s best friend from their indiana univers dai who wa sit by the pool we ll move that weight around said ucla swim coach ron ballator who ha mix spitz into hi practic and is on of the truest believ in the spitz camp i m not tone said spitz who weigh 185 pound 10 more than in munich in six month i will be the fact that spitz is more like on of us now than he wa when he wa 22 make hi quest to us hi word all the more enchant he isn t an untouch god he us to be but not anymor now he s a husband and the father of an 8 year old boi who d rather plai basebal than swim spitz run hi own real estat develop busi and never becam a dentist despit what peopl rememb he walk the ucla campu in baggi sweat slouch over as is hi wai and no on pai attent to him i ow it to myself i ow it to my sport i ow it to my gener i think to find out what it s all about spitz said i realli preserv myself i wa mr joe straight arrow i don t drink i don t smoke i don t do drug what doe it take to get a bodi back in shape we ll all find out but spitz is come back for reason more profound than thi if he simpli want to find out how fast he could swim for swim s sake he would join a master club and compet against men hi ag although he s not do that it wa a friend in master swim that gave him the idea to try for on more olymp last spring spitz ran into lanc larson a member of the 1960 olymp team who is swim master and go faster than he did 30 year ago he suggest spitz could do that too that s ridicul spitz said wallac meanwhil wa take anoth tack with spitz s 1972 time firmli in mind he love to calcul where hi buddi would have place had he swum that time in a certain event just last spring at the ncaa championship he look at the scoreboard after the 100 butterfli turn toward a woman in the stand and held up an open hand fifth he thought the woman nod and smile back she wa marg counsilman wife of spitz s coach at indiana the legendari doc counsilman think about that wallac said hi world record would have been good for fifth place 17 year later and that eventu wa what got to spitz he set a world record in munich with a time of 54 27 second in the 100 butterfli the current world record is 52 84 set by pablo moral of the unit state all of spitz s other world record have been lower by three or five second but not thi on hi butterfli time would have place eighth at the 1988 olymp spitz start to wonder if he might not be abl to swim that time again or go even faster as those in master swim were do he would have to train for on event not seven as he did in 1972 he could test new coach techniqu with new coach he could regain hi elig becaus of new rule allow profession in swim he could try to do the imposs the onli reason i m in thi is becaus of what swimmer in the 100 butterfli didn t do in the last 17 to 18 year he said thei didn t improv my time by that much it s also interest to note spitz s 54 27 might not have been the best he could have swum in the late summer of 1972 for on he wa involv in all those damn event and wa conserv energi ani time he got ahead in a race he also wa not push in the 100 fly in munich bruce robertson of canada won the silver in 55 56 that s a signific differ in swim if i just do my same time it s competit he said if i improv my time we re talk about possibl break the world record i ve got noth to lose i ll go in three stage get into shape as a 22 year old which i ll do in the next six month go fast enough to make the olymp team in the trial in 1992 and then go to the olymp and see what i get to ask a question is to burst the bubbl but an observ must do it how do you get back into the shape of a 22 year old when you re 40 spitz i m ask myself that same question but there ar gui who ar 50 who ar swim faster than when thei were 20 their time ar slower than mine but the analog still work anoth question but didn t thei have more to improv upon than you who wa in peak condit at 22 ye that s true spitz said mayb that s a factor i don t know the safe thing to sai is i won t make it that s more logic spitz would prefer not to think of all thi at least not now i have on great rai of hope in 1988 pablo wa the world record holder and pablo didn t make the olymp team thei didn t break hi world record either i wa the world record holder in 1968 and i lost by finish second i don t have to be the best befor the olymp to get to the olymp the path to the olymp begin sometim late thi summer when spitz said he will compet in hi first race it probabl will not be part of a convent meet at least two tv network have express interest in be there when he first step onto the block and it s like the event will be built around spitz until then he is swim simpli to prepar after a morn of busi call spitz make hi 10 minut walk from home to pool for hi 3 30 p m workout with the ucla team although ballator is more engross with hi dozen collegian he keep a watch ey on spitz who is work himself back into shape after the injuri by swim 2 000 to 3 000 yard a dai six dai a week he need to get up to 6 000 and he will ballator said even so spitz will not swim as mani mile for thi olymp as other might becaus he will be so focus on the butterfli interestingli although the butterfli is hi stroke spitz will swim mostli freestyl until the dai of hi first race close in he never did a lot of fly anywai ballator said earlier in the dai ballator spoke over the phone with georg hain who coach spitz when he wa a teenag i think he can do it hain said to ballator tell me how doe hi freestyl look it look great ballator said yeah hain repli it alwai look great to make the team that head to barcelona spitz will have to finish either first or second in the 100 fly at the trial in march 1992 to get to the trial he will have to swim a qualifi time sometim the year befor in 1988 the qualifi time wa 55 79 second but it will be lower thi time matt biondi won the 88 trial in 53 09 and took the silver medal in seoul in 53 01 second 1 100th of a second behind gold medalist anthoni nesti of surinam biondi had the gold medal in hi grasp until he miscalcul the number of stroke it would take to hit the wall he glide in and nesti won when biondi s last stroke did not carri him to the finish if that had been mark there s no wai he would have lost that race said wallac he s too competit if spitz qualifi he will face about 40 swimmer for those two spot on the olymp team make the team would put him on qualifi heat from the eight man final in barcelona the final would put him within a minut of the most improb person stori in olymp histori spitz alreadi ha a bank vault full of gold medal nine in all seven from munich two from relai dure hi disappoint perform at the 1968 mexico citi game but he is come back to earn someth worth more than gold to him the respect and perhap even the love of american who never understood or realli care for him the last time he came around arrog is a part of the swim psych the look the air that tell anoth swimmer you ar about to beat them spitz wa great at walk around the pool as if he own the place and he just about did ask if he thought he wa go to hit it rich after munich and he did hi answer typic wa someth like ar there star in the sky he s definit mellow said wallac he s not as sarcast as he wa he wa veri inward focus then he realli didn t care what he said or what other said about him all that matter to him wa what he did in the water those were strang terribl time soon after hi last race in munich spitz who is jewish wa whisk out of town when terrorist took 11 isra athlet and coach hostag and later kill them all spitz wa safe but he wa caught in a whirlwind of emot that deposit him in a world of endors and total isol i wa 22 the press wa differ athlet wa differ he said i start make monei from an amateur sport there wa a littl queasi and uneasi feel about the fact that i wa do it i wa on the scene for 14 year but the public all of a sudden becam awar of me in a on week period of time and then i wa gone i wasn t out to make anoth touchdown pass like joe montana or anoth super bowl championship or whatev now it s not that i want to bask in the glori that i think i wa deni but the fact is i m try to do someth that for me is an interest and excit challeng it sort of repres the ideal of the olymp it s the spirit of compet the attempt swim peopl ar intrigu he s got a lot go against him said biondi winner of five gold on silver and on bronz in seoul ag hi time out of swim and the tremend amount of motiv need to smash peopl like a bug there ar plenti of obstacl but he definit ha a chanc if anyon can do it said ballator he s the kind of gui who can but can anyon do it my dai ar number spitz said i ve got 26 month befor the olymp trial twenti six month

is a system to distribut that inform if i wa told that my athlet had to eat pea to win thei would be eat pea in three dai yessi sai hi survei of soviet research show that much of what the current us research foreshadow is alreadi realiti in the soviet union the soviet and eastern bloc countri yessi sai train their coach at govern sport institut with an emphasi on sport scienc coach work with elit soviet athlet must have been rank athlet themselv and have complet postgradu instruct in sport scienc mani top research ar former athlet nutrit evalu includ frequent blood and urin test is as much a part of a soviet athlet s routin as a warm up jog but most import accord to yessi the soviet begin their athletictrain process by evalu children psycholog and physic at a young ag and enrol promis candid in state school where gener educ is combin with athlet train and where sport scienc can be appli and further yessi point to recent paper publish in the soviet union about the us of high intens field current to measur muscl fatigu the studi wa conduct on olymp athlet and hope the soviet system will allow ani applic glean from the studi to be easili dissemin in thi countri not onli would athlet and coach be unlik to hear about the studi and it result but it also would be difficult to get athlet to interrupt their train to particip in thi kind of experiment robert voi sai what the soviet have that the american don t is the full attent of the athlet none of the scientist think the soviet system could or even should translat directli to the unit state where the tradit of individu effort is the norm but all would like to appli some of the soviet train techniqu gideon ariel is particip in a program start last year in israel that he think show the direct that would make us athlet most success ariel and a group of sport scientist he s chosen from a varieti of east bloc countri have identifi sport in which isra athlet can be world domin by 2000 on of those chosen wa women s field hockei ariel sai todai in israel young girl who have excel in sport such as volleybal ar be test for the movement skill need for field hockei you begin with children who ar 5 or 6 year old you

rest of their educ as is done in the soviet union the institut will be expens and probabl elitist but could point the wai to make advanc train more avail without such in at the ground floor program howev the trick to get the full attent of the athlet mai be through monei in 1981 the unit state began to open it nation team to sponsorship and to allow athlet to earn monei place in a trust fund while thei compet as amateur from individu endors and even prize monei the leader in the process wa the athlet congress the govern bodi of track and field event although he see an increas central in the unit state yessi believ that the wai superstar ar creat here will be much the same wai thei have alwai been creat through the individu desir to win that will bring coach and athlet to scienc as it doe from time to time now in search of the better techniqu and the latest info and their success will in turn propel the unit state toward more and more central option that he see as necessari to high perform alreadi he sai he is approach by parent ask him whether he can test their children to find out which sport is best for them and in on case yessi is work with a coach and an athlet try to
