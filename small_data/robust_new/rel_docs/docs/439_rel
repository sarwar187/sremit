fluid did not manifest suffici er effect or the polar of particl in them wa too unstabl to make the characterist of the fluid reliabl todai improv have result in particl that reliabl show mark er effect becom avail the shear stress of a dispers type er fluid can be express as a function of the shear rate as in figur 7 a when a voltag is appli the fluid behav uniqu like a bingham fluid by displai a forc surrend stress that fix the electrod at zero shear rate the magnitud of surrend stress is on of the index for the magnitud of an er effect although it is differ from fluid to fluid surrend stress valu for the newest dispers type er fluid rang from 0 5 kpa to 4 kpa to make thi chang more understand in a familiar sens it is approxim equival to the chang from milk to chees accord to chief research kazuya edamura of the technic develop depart technic divis fujikura kasei the er effect of a dispers type er fluid diminish when the shear rate exce a certain level becaus particl chain ar broken down by shear as long as the shear rate remain low these broken chain can recombin with adjac chain but the recombin becom difficult as the shear rate increas the liquid crystal type er fluid behav complet differ from the dispers type er fluid when an electr field is appli the viscos chang for the liquid crystal type as it doe for the dispers type howev the liquid crystal type

ar more than on order smaller than the rate for the dispers type er fluid thu it is necessari to design devic so as to have a narrow distanc between the electrod in order to be abl to us a liquid

for exampl an automot engin room must be abl to function reliabl up to a temperatur of 120 c while such a wide actuat temperatur rang mai not be need for us in a factori the kei consider is to have an all around balanc instead of on super excel rate among other so so rate a maker need development skill to creat thi balanc of rate for an er fluid while maintain it stabl and signific er effect the particular area where the uniqu of each maker is shown to be most pronounc is the method of secur the dispers stabil for an er fluid when left stand undisturb a dispers type er fluid lose it colloid

stretch over five year their experi got so hot that a palladium electrod vapor the scientist said at their salt lake citi press confer march 23 the sicili meet gave fleischmann an opportun to mend a few bridg with anoth utah scientist who ha also claim to have achiev fusion in a test tube but who ha disput the pon and fleischmann claim of produc excess energi steven jone a physicist at brigham young univers had complain earlier that the other scientist broke an agreement to publish their work simultan with hi we want now to work togeth if thi prove practic fleischmann said some of the

sai he s found the wai to make electr power car commonplac in america he claim to have invent a hybrid method of merg an electr turbin with an exist intern combust engin and a comput that could power a full size car cheaper and with less pollut but with just as much pep as convent car mcgee is chairman of a tini compani call american motion system inc that is base in iowa but is move to camarillo where it ha an offic mcgee said he s share hi invent first with us auto maker not the japanes or european he sai on us auto maker is pai him under contract to test hi invent and that he s in talk with anoth auto maker but he ha agre not to identifi the compani he also said the invent is patent and that he is negoti with the auto maker on develop fee and royalti on futur sale i m not a zealot but i person would like to see the american manufactur back on top he said but mcgee s idea hasn t gotten out of the garag yet he s never put hi new engin into a car and driven it to prove it work in addit there ar hundr of other design for electr car which make the odd veri long that mcgee s invent will becom standard equip in mass produc car car maker research and garag inventor have been tinker with electr car for decad yet the vehicl ar still experiment auto maker ar under grow feder and local pressur to build car in the 1990s that spew out fewer smog creat emiss and expert agre some type of

produc last week gm said it wa proceed with develop of the car name the impact but it would not sai when or how the car would be built for sale even if gm or anoth auto maker consid hi invent mcgee ha lot of competit there ar probabl sever hundr hybrid invent and develop go on around the world relat to electr car said paul maccreadi presid of aeroviron gm spokesman david sloan said mcgee contact the compani late last year but that gm doe not have a contract with him that leav ford and chrysler david makowiec a ford spokesman in the area of invent and develop brought to ford said he ha noth in hi file regard mcgee or am mcgee 42 said that for the first time the compani face regulatori order to produc car with significantli lower emiss some version of the pend feder clean air bill for instanc would requir auto maker start in the mid 1990s to build car that run on altern fuel mcgee said the car maker want that timet push back becaus thei don t have the technolog to compli and he is public hi invent to basic cry bull here is the technolog let s see you gui hunker down roll up your sleev and give it to the american public recent develop electr car those power by electr onli suffer from sever flaw thei ar sluggish and have a rang usual limit to less than 100 mile befor the batteri need recharg recharg can take sever hour gm impact can acceler much like convent car but it ha a rang of onli 120 mile by contrast mcgee s plan is to power a car with a convent motorcycl engin connect to an electr turbin he ha develop there also would be a turbin in each wheel 200 pound of batteri in the trunk and a comput near the dashboard accord to mcgee s blueprint the 25 pound steel turbin draw electr from the batteri and start the motorcycl engin the engin then drive the turbin which send electr power to the smaller turbin that drive each wheel the comput govern the whole process and divert excess electr from the turbin back to the batteri so thei ar constantli be recharg that give the car a rang of 500 to 600 mile he said the combin of the engin and turbin also give the car the equival of about 150 in peak horsepow even though the motorcycl engin consum less fuel than convent auto engin he said becaus the comput turbin system appli power directli to the wheel it also elimin the need for a convent transmiss brake differenti and power steer system he said the upshot of the system is that the engin us less fuel emit on third of the smog produc hydrocarbon of a typic six cylind engin and weigh on third less than convent car he said the turbin system also easili adapt to an intern combust engin us altern fuel such as ethanol or grain alcohol which would further cut the car s emiss he said peter b bo presid of polydyn inc a san mateo research firm said that even though he doe not know the specif of mcgee s plan mcgee ha the right approach in develop a hybrid turbin combust engin format there is no technolog i know of anywher in which an all electr vehicl can achiev the rang of a convent vehicl mainli becaus there is no batteri right now that i know of that will be abl to store suffici energi for a 300 to 400 mile rang bo said a hybrid can do that an all electr vehicl cannot he said mcgee said hi idea for a turbin assist car engin goe back a decad in 1982 he start hi own firm magna motiv industri and move to fairfield iowa becaus the state provid 150 000 in seed monei he start two other compani magnet research intern and am to rais fund for specif project and now plan to merg the three and move hi oper to camarillo the three firm which onli do research and develop work will have about 1 million in revenu thi year said mcgee ad that he ha about 500 000 person invest in hi busi he s also work on similar turbin that can make motor in wash machin gener and refriger more effici but what s to stop the us auto maker from simpli ignor hi technolog noth he said but if in fact that s how it goe we ll us the revenu from these other market area
