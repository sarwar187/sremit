fulleren molecul ar extrem stabl from the kinet point of view but then again veri unstabl in thermodynam term and becaus of their thermodynam behavior thei can be readili transform into new kind of

where a major organ is transplant everi 40 minut in the unit state todai surgeon ar experi with a new gener of anti reject drug that mai alter the field everi bit as much as cyclosporin did these drug ar more potent than cyclosporin at prevent reject and so far at least seem to have fewer side effect some also ar cheaper a not insignific consider for drug that must be taken for the remaind of a person s life but more import most of the new drug seem more select pinpoint and suppress onli the portion of the immun system that attack the organ and leav the rest free to fight off infect dr han solling a transplant surgeon at the univers of wisconsin in madison predict that the us of transplant drug will soon bear a strong resembl to the current situat with antibiot where physician choos from among 20 or more drug to treat a certain type of infect and a certain type of patient i forese a time in the futur when we will determin the type of reject what immun cell type is involv and so forth open our drawer and select the proper drug for a given organ and a given type of reject he said as a result transplant will becom even more routin than thei ar now more peopl who have a defect organ will be abl to receiv a replac and those replac will last longer than thei do now on the darker side howev these develop will increas the demand for donor organ which ar alreadi in short suppli

egyptian manuscript written in 2000 bc but it wa not until the 1940s that scientist comprehend how to successfulli carri out a transplant dure that period the late nobel laureat sir peter brian medawar of oxford univers demonstr definit that transplant failur wa caus by the veri immun system that protect the bodi against infect base on medawar s work research realiz that it wa necessari to stop the immun system from attack an implant organ as it would a diseas caus bacterium unfortun the onli techniqu avail to suppress the immun system wa whole bodi irradi which destroi all the immun

joseph e murrai he us steroid hormon that suppress the inflamm that is part of the reject process becaus the steroid did not suppress the immun system effect he wa forc to us organ from live donor who were close relat to the recipi in the late 1960s chemist georg hitch of the burrough wellcom co synthes a deriv of a cancer drug that strongli suppress the immun system thi drug call azathioprin or

than 65 of the patient and most were much less success furthermor imuran s broad suppress of the immun system left patient suscept to a varieti of infect as well as to an increas risk of cancer which is normal kept in check by the immun system that situat chang dramat with the 1970 discoveri of cyclosporin in a fungu from southern norwai immunologist jean borel of the swiss pharmaceut firm sandoz

year surviv rate more than doubl to 70 transplant oper flower as never befor but cyclosporin had it unfortun side effect as well most critic it damag the kidnei by lower it clearanc of wast from the

surviv for a second note stanford immunologist randal c morri in practic term that attrit mean mani patient perhap as mani as half of all kidnei recipi ar come back for second third and even fourth organ but research such as morri ar studi a number of new drug that thei think will chang that curv for the better on of the most thoroughli studi so far is call fk506 fk506 wa discov in 1984 by research from the fujisawa pharmaceut co in a soil sampl taken onli a coupl of mile from their laboratori in tsukuba japan thei were us what morri describ as an extrem sophist and still larg secret system for screen soil and water sampl to look for anti reject drug it is the first such agent that wa not found by accid the new chemic belong to a class of bacteri product call macrolid a famili that includ the commonli prescrib antibiot erythromycin fujisawa scientist found that fk506 wa 30 time more potent than cyclosporin in suppress the immun system which meant that it potenti be could given in much smaller dose to minim side effect but fk506 wa almost never us in human immunologist roi a caln of cambridg univers in england found that it wa toxic in dog and hi report in the british

interestingli morri said the drug not onli halt reject episod it also stimul regrowth and repair of damag liver cell no other drug doe that morri said starzl said that most patient who receiv the drug leav the hospit within two week after a liver transplant about half the recuper time requir with cyclosporin thei also have fewer reject episod infect and so far at least side effect becaus of the improv recuper time starzl predict that the cost of liver transplant will be reduc by at least on third from the current level of about 200 000 and that cost reduct also will be achiev with other type of transplant clinic trial of the drug at other medic center ar expect to begin shortli a varieti of other drug that promis to improv on fk506 ar be studi at stanford and elsewher to speed up research on the drug morri ha develop an innov techniqu he take small piec of heart tissu from on strain of mous and place them between the cartilag and skin in the ear of mice from a differ strain blood vessel grow into the heart tissu and within four to six dai the muscl tissu begin beat although it is not pump blood if we don t treat the recipi it will be reject in 10 dai he said we can treat it

them head to head like thi we can make clear distinct among them and see what the role of each will be he said on new drug that morri consid promis is rapamycin a close rel of fk506 that wa discov in the 1970s by research from ayerst laboratori in canada who were look for antibiot to fight yeast infect rapamycin wa a good antibiot morri said but it also interf with the immun system so it wa shelv but it wa that veri properti plu the fact that it ha a molecular structur much like that of fk506 that prompt morri to evalu it as an anti reject drug i didn t expect it to be much differ from fk506 morri said i wa veri veri surpris becaus in rat it is veri potent about 60 time as potent as cyclosporin and twice as potent as fk506 it s the most potent drug we ve ever seen morri hope to begin test rapamycin in primat thi year morri ha high hope for anoth drug call rs 61443 becaus it oper by a complet differ mechan than fk506 and other macrolid and thu mai be abl to interven at a differ stage of reject morri ha test rs 61443 in all three anim system mice rat and monkei and found that it could prevent reject and revers advanc reject it is particularli promis said wisconsin s solling who ha also test it in dog becaus it combat chronic reject which none of the other avail drug doe solling us the drug which is routin us to treat the skin diseas psoriasi for the first time in a human transplant patient in april and he and research at the univers of alabama plan to studi it in more kidnei transplant patient morri said that the stanford team plan to test rs 61443 in heart transplant

patient were taken off deprenyl for a month to ensur that the appar slowdown in diseas progress wa due to the preserv of nerv cell and not simpli to relief of symptom the drug therapi wa then restart

go to happen to them if thei develop diabet and that could be much wors the new approach to therapi is base on the grow recognit that type i diabet is an autoimmun diseas in which the bodi attack it own tissu in thi case the insulin secret beta cell of the pancrea insulin help most of the bodi s cell take up biolog fuel especi the sugar glucos in the absenc of insulin the glucos accumul to high

agenc in new york citi wa the first patient rilei and maclaren treat with imuran peggi wa 14 when her younger sister eleni develop type i diabet the florida research were then screen larg number of diabet rel to studi the reliabl of antibodi test thei found that islet cell autoantibodi were present in peggi but at low level becaus her grandfath had also had type i diabet and two aunt had the less sever but more common form of diabet known as type ii the research continu watch her type i diabet ha long been known to run in famili sibl of diabet patient have as much as an 11 risk of develop the condit much higher than the overal popul risk of 16 case per 100 000 about a year later her blood sugar level start climb and her insulin level start fall rilei put her on imuran and she ha been take two 50 milligram tablet everi dai sinc polopolu said the imuran therapi ha not had ani advers effect on her i ve had cold everi onc in a while but i wa prone to get cold anywai she did develop mononucleosi dure colleg but rilei believ that wa unrel to imuran us most import her blood sugar level which wa abov normal when she began the regimen drop back into the normal rang and ha stai there ever sinc polopolu believ she ha been incred lucki to be spare the insulin inject that her sister must take rilei maclaren and their colleagu treat on other patient an 8 year old girl who had more beta cell damag than polopolu when she began the therapi the onset of her diseas wa delai for four year after begin her therapi howev the research decid not to treat ani more patient until thei had accumul more inform on the predict valu of the antibodi we were too far ahead of ourselv rilei said we couldn t convinc other peopl we had the data now base on sever studi in which imuran prevent develop of diabet in rodent thei believ thei have the data and other research agre in april the nation institut of diabet and digest and kidnei diseas conven in washington to consid their and other research that confer conclud that the time wa ripe to begin wider clinic trial research at the four medic center plan to screen 8 000 to 10 000 close rel of patient with type i diabet the initi screen will be for islet cell autoantibodi individu who test posit will then be studi for insulin antibodi and impair insulin secret those who test posit for these characterist will be enrol in the studi those who do not will be re examin everi six month as mani as 80 of those who ar posit for these test ar expect to develop diabet within five year without treatment the accuraci could be improv rilei said if thei test for anti 64 k antibodi but that test is still too expens and cumbersom but he predict it will be us within a year or so from thi test the four center expect to identifi 75 to 80 children who ar at high risk these will be treat with imuran and monitor for as long as necessari the first patient identifi began imuran treatment in florida four week ago meanwhil research at harvard ar attempt a differ approach test in anim have shown that administ insulin to potenti diabet befor the pancrea is sever damag can interfer with the immun attack even block it complet dure the therapi call beta cell rest the pancrea sharpli reduc it insulin product furthermor the protein on the surfac of beta cell that ar attack by the immun system disappear halt the attack said harvard endocrinologist richard jackson two children have so far been enrol in the studi 16 year old sean finlei of alexandria la and 9 year old john moor of indianapoli each take two dose of insulin per dai that total about on quarter the normal daili dose for a diabet everi nine month thei fly to boston for a week of intens intraven insulin therapi that attempt to shut off the pancrea complet the hope is that even though the boi have to take insulin daili the pancrea will continu to function well enough to prevent the wide swing in blood sugar concentr that caus the complic of diabet sean ha been in the program 18 month and john for 12 month with no appar declin in pancreat function each wa expect to develop diabet within three year of diagnosi so it is too soon to tell if the treatment is success the harvard group hope to enrol three to five more patient in the trial but endocrinologist georg eisenbarth conced that most pre diabet the group identifi will be enrol in the imuran trial becaus it seem more promis if the clinic trial prove success the next stage will expand the procedur to larger popul group even though rel of diabet have a high risk of develop the diseas thei nonetheless repres a small minor of all type i diabet victim eventu the entir popul under ag 25 would have to be screen an exception daunt prospect and becaus the ag of onset vari children would have to be screen period in order to detect the first sign that task would be simplifi if research could identifi a gene that would be highli predict of diabet risk but that possibl is in the distant futur and research ar now concentr onli on the first stage the therapi maclaren said ar certainli go to work the question we ar go to have to settl ar for how long how well and at what cost and even if we ar onli abl to delai onset for a number of year ad endocrinologist david m kipni of washington univers in st loui that s a real accomplish
