year vari onli with the econom cycl there wa a brief upward blip with the arriv of the independ in 1986 the market ha now settl back to 2 2m copi a dai bang in line with the 20 year averag as for readership the surpris fact is that the averag for the qualiti daili ha actual risen over the past decad from 3 1 reader per copi to 3 3 onc more the trend in the tabloid press ha been the other wai the reason ar a matter for debat the net effect though is that qualiti press readership ha actual risen by some 12 per cent over the period thi leav us with the promis advent of electron media a phenomenon of undeni signific and uncertain date it practic impact on the market ha so far been almost zero the econom characterist of electron newspap ar unclear as is their relationship with convent

have been rather more prosaic dure the 1980s the qualiti press in britain fare better than the tabloid in circul the qualiti also push their cover price up much more aggress so that between 1982 and

marlboro s owner philip morri shock the market by slash the us price by 20 per cent the philip morri board which made that decis includ mr murdoch the time price cut in septemb wa even more aggress than marlboro s amount to some 30 per cent over a six dai week nevertheless it wa not without commerci logic within six month the time s circul had shot up from about 360 000 to 515 000 simpl arithmet suggest that circul revenu on an annualis basi thu stai almost unchang at the same time higher sale should have allow the time to charg more for it advertis space thi is import sinc the averag broadsheet get about twice as much revenu from advertis as from circul what thi ha actual been worth for the time is a matter of guesswork it ha not rais it offici advertis rate and the rate card of most newspap ar in ani case a polit fiction in the last quarter of 1993 accord to on industri estim the qualiti as a class were discount their advertis space by about 40 per cent the net effect of all thi on the time s profit is hard to gaug especi sinc the rise in circul will have meant a correspond rise in newsprint and other product cost nevertheless it can be argu that until last week mr murdoch s strategi wa defens in commerci term then came mr black s intervent and the game chang overnight thi is where the cock up theori come in the telegraph s cut in it weekli newspap bill veri

that togeth with a 29 per cent drop in price and a back of the envelop calcul suggest that circul revenu fall 18 per cent mr murdoch s immedi reaction to cut the price of the time by a further third mean hi sum go out of the window as well but as he will doubtless have calcul hi hand is stronger than mr black s in two respect first mr murdoch s global empir is a good deal bigger than mr black s and hi pocket ar deeper second the profit or loss of the time ar buri in mr murdoch s group account the paper is believ to have lost monei for year but there is no know for sure the account of the

contain the damag it is not clear where thei will find them the big save in product were made in the late 1980s cut editori staff dure a circul war would risk defeat the object attempt will doubtless be made to squeez the margin of the newsag but the newsag can take care of themselv meanwhil the cost of newsprint is move up in it usual cyclic fashion and sinc the last upsw in the cycl both paper have ad to their newsprint bill by increas their pagin the altern is to push up circul still further execut at the time ar talk of rais their circul to 700 000 if thei succe and it is a big if thei mai onc again have recoup lost revenu even so the paper will scarc be break even if it is ever to make a decent commerci return it price must eventu be push back up again the crucial question for the

ar now read probabl is obsolet it s not that video ha supersed print as thi cultur s medium of choic although it ha or that newspap ar inher incap of captur and hold peopl s attent it s that most newspap as current written design and publish ar give peopl less and less of what thei realli need newspap ar misnam the idea that newspap ar about the new is simpli wrong if you look at the histori of newspap what you will discov is that their role wa less as a vehicl for new than as a medium to creat commun of interest consid your own reason for read thi paper is it just to get the latest inform or is it to feel connect to a part of a larger commun rememb on of the most success ad campaign in histori wa not reach out and inform someon it wa reach out and touch someon peopl want to feel connect new is just on wai to continu energ those connect so the real issu here is less packag the new than creat these commun that s why tomorrow s newspap have to be fundament differ from todai s editor and publish need to explor wai to build newer and tighter relationship with their reader and advertis instead of reli on editori rhinoplasti and promot gimcrack success newspap will us emerg technolog to redefin their role as the vital commun medium the problem is that most newspap editor ar prison of print thei think pure in term of text stori quot photo chart and column like thi on their notion of high technolog is the newsroom word process system publish ar littl better innov to them is high speed insert machin and ink that won t smear onto reader finger everyth revolv around

driven new coverag columnist and format to technolog driven with telecommun audio video and comput media us to redefin the role of the print page the intellig deploy of technolog is the kei to transform an audienc of passiv reader into an activ commun of share interest for exampl there is no reason why each newspap section can t have it own answer machin to take reader comment and suggest transcrib these verbal letter to the editor and weav them into the section print a custom tailor questionnair in the busi section on tax or in the sport section on the all star team and encourag peopl to fax in their respons these fax poll offer a wai to build new link with the reader and technolog can turn the reader into a particip usa todai ha done someth like thi with 900 number telephon poll with some success but it s handl more like a vox populi gimmick than an integr part of the paper s editori mission but integr text and telecommun make sens newsdai in long island ny ha enjoi signific revenu from it 976 sport and weather phone line why not put a 900 number at the end of a stori on sai mutual fund invest option for a small fee the reader can call the number to get more inform from the journalist who did the stori the wai you do it is have the journalist tape a five minut interview on the stori and then index the interview so that peopl can us their touch tone phone to access the bit of inform thei want blend print with thi sort of audiotex servic strike me as an obviou wai to get peopl to view the newspap as a commun inform resourc there ar all kind of new and servic

these bulletin board offer low cost commun and access to a veri desir demograph think of it as an on line newslett for special interest group the bulletin board can point out relev stori in the newspap and the newspap point peopl with more special interest toward the bulletin board put past movi review or restaur review on line might be a genuin servic on also shouldn t ignor the role technolog could plai in creat a new level of respons in advertis there s noth stop a newspap from serv as a clearinghous for more inform on it advertis for exampl why shouldn t a newspap offer to fax a restaur menu of on of it advertis to a reader request it my gosh some weekli newspap alreadi offer telephon mailbox for their person ad why shouldn t daili newspap offer such servic for it classifi ad clientel ye there ar a bunch of newspap rang from thi on to the hartford courant now explor how best to transmit fax version of themselv and ye time mirror the parent of thi newspap lost million try to turn the pig s ear of videotex into a silk purs of publish profit but those approach to technolog ar noth more than an extens of the print mind set thei treat technolog as a medium for dispens data instead of as a tool to craft commun the idea here is to get more than peopl s ey involv in the newspap the goal is to us the newspap as both a platform and a springboard to other media ideal these media enhanc the valu of the newspap and vice versa thi technolog driven vision of the futur of newspap doesn t in ani wai jeopard the next gener of ben hecht and mike royko ani more than the
