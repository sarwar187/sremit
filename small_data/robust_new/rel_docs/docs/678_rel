therapist and step famili specialist who teach at the california famili studi center in north hollywood that s why a lot of children of divorc parent get the what s wrong with us blue or indulg in fantasi like lisa s for the kid the feel of famili come from their sens of who the member of the famili ar sai seibt i m sure you ve heard the statement that divorc doesn t end the famili it onli restructur it and that s import becaus kid have their own intern pictur of who is in and who is not in the famili and thei ar veri protect of that imag or fantasi the happi famili fantasi dish up by the media is tremend dishearten to the million of famili that cannot hope to attain it what thei need to rememb sai constanc ahron a usc professor and co author of live with divorc is that intact famili aren t exactli perfect unit either divorc and remarri famili ar the predomin trend and we treat them as though thei re unusu or deviant she sai we have nostalgia for a famili of the past and we forget that that famili wa not alwai that happi what about alcohol incest a common refrain among divorc parent is that a holidai without children doesn t realli feel like a holidai the tradit of be togeth wa shatter gari hint sai so try to make holidai on our own wa kind of an empti task joni pierson wa miser two year ago when her girl spent christma ev with their father it s import to me that thei wake up with me on christma morn she sai the year befor last thei woke up at hi hous on christma dai it wa difficult for me jim and iren pierc both 44 sai that when jason is with hi mother and john michael is at hi father s on christma dai their hous feel painfulli empti you look around and go todai s christma uh uh where ar the kid where is the famili self piti is an easi trap for a lone parent sai seibt it is especi damag when the children ar made to feel guilti a lot of time unconsci thei sai thing that make the kid feel guilti i want you to have fun with your dad and i m go to be all alon he sai instead he sai parent should make plan for themselv then reassur their children that i love you and i am take care of myself and thi is dad s christma with you and next year you will spend christma with me if parent don t want children to leav he sai thei ar just gonna have to learn to deal with it the wai ex spous treat each other alwai affect how children handl a divorc but dure the holidai children ar especi sensit to hostil which can reverber like sonic boom seibt sai that around the holidai he see thing go kind of crazi with the step famili he counsel becaus if you ve got a situat where the parent can t work out the issu or the parent still continu to be in conflict and fight the kid will be caught in the middl and will feel that he ha to pleas on or the other parent and will feel guilti if he choos to see on or the other of them moreov the coupl who fight the hardest after divorc ar still profoundli bond he sai in divorc famili ahron categor the type of post divorc parent relationship thei rang from perfect pal to fieri foe the major find of my studi is that we have a stereotyp of what ex spous look like in their relationship angri peopl who can t talk to each other sai ahron yet we find a good percentag of peopl who ar quit cooper after divorc becaus of the children the pierc activ in their local stepfamili assn experi both extrem jim s relationship with hi ex wife peggi larson is tens and angri while iren s relationship with her ex husband juan mont and hi wife shirlei is cordial as it happen the lawyer jason pierc plan to contact wa on vacat

three frustrat by the situat although he sai he is not angri at hi son he believ jason misunderstood the custodi proceed becaus he wa not in the courtroom and he sai he doubt that jason fulli understand the legal process involv he s caught in loyalti conflict sai pierc in the meantim jason will be spend christma in california thi year becaus he is optimist that next year he will be live with hi mother who is encourag hi legal fight unlik a lot of children of divorc parent jason doesn t yearn for hi parent to be togeth for the holidai for on thing he wa so young when thei split up that he doesn t rememb them ever spend the holidai togeth for anoth he know thei can t be in the same room thei d end up kill each other he sai someon would start carv the turkei and thei d end up
