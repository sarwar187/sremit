worldwid petroleum crisi in the 1970s that spur the rapid develop of new energi resourc and renew energi resourc in the develop countri the subsequ resolut of that crisi and fall petroleum price have onc again slow the develop momentum of new energi resourc and renew energi resourc dure the past sever year mankind ha come to understand that fossil energi resourc reserv ar limit and that pollut from fossil energi resourc ha obvious destroi the equilibrium between global space and the overal ecolog on which mankind depend for it exist and that non pollut new energi resourc and renew energi resourc ar truli energi resourc on which it can reli wind energi is a clean and renew inexhaust energi resourc through more than 10 year of research and develop the technolog is matur and the econom and social benefit ar appar the price of wind gener electr in the unit state is 0 06 to 0 07 per kwh and will drop to 0 04 by the year 2000 as a result the develop countri ar compet to develop it and ar invest larg amount of capit formul sever medium and long term develop program and establish all type of organ to conduct r d such as denmark s lisuo wind power gener experi station the unit state wind energi associ the japan wind energi associ the european wind energi assoc etc at the same time all countri ar compet to formul the associ polici such as provid tax exempt for privat capit invest in wind energi in the unit state and requir that electr power compani purchas wind gener electr from wind power gener field and the implement of a on third subsidi from the state in denmark for privat purchas of wind power gener and permit the sale of electr to electr power compani wind energi develop and util in china ha alwai been a concern of the state and sever kei wind energi project were includ among project to attack kei s t problem dure the sixth 5 year plan seventh 5 year plan and eighth 5 year plan china ha now establish an s t and product staff of more than 3 000 peopl and we have establish sever 10 product plant produc small scale and larg and medium size wind power machineri with an annual small scale wind power gener product capac of 30 000 unit and develop and product of 55 kw 120 kw and 200 kw wind power gener is now in progress china as a whole ha now extend 120 000 small wind power gener and we have nine medium size and small wind power gener field under

power water lift machineri us in the tianjin region ha produc veri good econom result in desalin of veget field and thei ar now make major effort to extend them china is a develop countri with a larg popul vast territori and shortag of energi resourc the develop of new energi resourc is a strateg shift for energi resourc and can produc real benefit given china s technic capabl develop wind energi is certainli not someth that cannot be attain china s famou scientist qian xueseng 6929 1331 2773 wrote to the china wind energi technolog develop center in 1991 describ the world s major effort at present to develop wind energi and china s broad prospect for wind energi develop and sai that we must develop them in a major wai instead of just piddl around in june 1991 at the wind energi construct plan confer held by the ministri of energi resourc minist huang yicheng 7806 3015 6134 point out that develop wind energi requir that we foster everyon s initi and that we get organ improv our understand of us wind power to gener electr and focu on wind power electr gener as on forc in overal electr power construct accord to preliminari plan by the ministri of energi resourc we will strive for an increas of 120 to 200mw a year to achiev thi object given china s exist wind energi technic forc we should take the rout of self develop which mean organ china s wind energi expert on our exist technic foundat in a plan manner absorb the essenc of advanc gener from foreign countri develop larg gener that conform to china s nation condit and engag in cooper as appropri with foreign busi that ar will to provid technolog as well as expand the proport of domest manufactur compon and attain a complet shift to domest product in the long term some of our product should satisfi domest demand and some of them should be export to develop countri to attain a foreign exchang balanc in the entir process we must watch out that all depart do not engag in blind import without conduct econom analysi the state scienc and technolog commiss and other ministri and commiss should control import and except in case that have state permiss we should focu on protect our own nascent industri and the state scienc and technolog commiss should increas it invest in wind energi r d the state econom and trade commiss should increas it invest in the wind power machineri industri and strive to attain a domest product rate of 80 percent for the wind power gener in china s wind power gener field by 2000 to chang the present lopsid develop situat current the intern price of larg wind power gener is about 900 to 1 000 per kw wherea the price of small domest hydropow gener is 3 000 yuan renminbi per kw so when thei ar be produc in larg batch the price of china s larg wind power gener could be 4 000 to 5 000 yuan renminbi and each kwh of electr about 0 04 yuan larg scale develop of wind energi would be best among new energi resourc so it would be entir capabl of compet with thermal power in region that have electr power shortag wind power electr on nan ao guangdong ha been welcom by the local electr power bureau and the nan ao island electr power compani can sustain it exist now by sell electr gener by wind power thu we can affirm that with the state s guidanc the develop of wind energi will produc real benefit

employe nine larg research center and other smaller area where it is work enea agenc for new technolog energi and the environ is present throughout itali amongst it new line of intervent there ar plan for the transfer and distribut of innov to product industri and agricultur the develop of compon and technolog for the util of renew sourc of energi and energi save as well as research and experiment of innov nuclear reactor that ar safer than those of the past thi redefinit of it area of compet is lai the foundat for the enea of the year 2000 it will be a produc of technolog and manageri cultur and be at the servic in particular of the manufactur world nicola cabibbo whom we have interview ha recent been call to direct thi research giant he is a scientist who is well known and respect by the intern scientif commun and ha come from the presid of the infn italian nation institut for nuclear physic prestipino prof cabibbo the handbook of the new enea is definit the 1993 95 three year program that wa publish in decemb 1992 and present the program and new object of the agenc in 115 page how much of thi reflect the situat of the old agenc and how much describ the new on cabibbo let us sai immedi that thi is a slide plan that ha suffer from the time when it wa drawn up and allow for chang of direct as it goe along the develop of the come year will influenc the wai it is follow prestipino it ha been said that the plan is alreadi old or that anywai it reflect the idea of the old agenc cabibbo when i arriv at the enea i did not consid review the plan becaus it is a lengthi procedur perhap i will particip in the prepar of the next on let us not forget that it ha been approv at ministeri level i think that it is veri import for the agenc to focu it activ better it nuclear activ have been interrupt enea ha found itself without the burden of thi institut duti from thi point of view the reform law of august 1991 is to be view veri posit sinc it gave the agenc precis goal nuclear energi wa an enorm job that requir commit involv great respons care for the environ and the develop of advanc technolog now my idea is to focu and gather the variou initi around major project in a context that is easier to understand so that the object to be pursu ar clearer the structur element ar still there i mean to sai there is still the expertis in the energi field and the field of relat problem from the ration us of energi to the altern sourc to nuclear energi and so on prestipino so is it a plan without an itinerari that is to be review as it goe along cabibbo certainli in the environment field for exampl a central problem is that of work in harmoni with the other who ar involv in thi field let us not forget that there ar about 3 000 research scatter around in variou research center work on the environ in itali and that about 800 of them ar in enea prestipino could enea have a role to plai in thi harmon process cabibbo in the environment field work is also done for project it is clear that enea will launch it own project like the on on the mediterranean basin that wa present at the end of septemb at our marin research center at santa teresa ye in some wai we put ourselv forward as promot and coordin a littl like we ar for the antarct but we ar alwai readi to compar what we ar do with what other ar do instead that which enea can specif provid and make avail to safeguard the environ on the on hand is system abil and on the other is technolog abil these two rich permit enea to take on import role at a global level in program that do not take singl aspect into consider but that consid the environment problem as a whole sinc thei ar necessarili interconnect and often requir multidisciplinari intervent and collabor with other countri for exampl spain is veri interest in collabor with us and franc be veri activ in the environment field is alreadi do so prestipino amongst the strategi for the renew of the agenc what effect will the new line that you announc have on the us of the ap arrai processor experi super comput cabibbo the super comput is a central element for the transfer of scientif knowledg to major applic rang from those of the environ such as meteorolog and climat chang to those of great technolog interest such as metallurgi and combust process enea ha order a larg parallel comput capabl of perform 100 billion oper per second an ap quadric produc by alenia spazio under licens from the infn at present it is the most power parallel comput avail in the world and the technolog is entir italian we have also order six small quadric that will either be us for develop program or for new type of applic made possibl by the avail of the power of a super comput that ha the size and advantag of a work station prestipino will the super comput also be us in the energi sector cabibbo certainli for exampl on of the problem that we ar carefulli studi in the energi field is that of combust and thi requir a combin of experiment techniqu and numer simul the trend is to consid the experiment techniqu as the valid of the simul techniqu the latter in fact ar much richer and permit a more detail and care studi enea ha a veri import experiment combust center at casaccia we ar try to integr thi experiment center so that it form part of a more complet pictur that will involv the us onc the quadric comput is avail of numer simul thi will put us in the vanguard prestipino at thi stage of renew while the structur of the agenc is be plan out on a grand scale what would be a burden and what would be help cabibbo compar to other agenc enea is divid into larg research center such as those at casaccia and frascati near rome saluggia in piemont trisaia in basilicata brasimon in the tuscan emilian appenin portico in campania santa teresa in liguria and bologna thi structur creat on on hand a manageri and organiz burden but on the other it offer the advantag of be abl to put an impos strike forc into the field to work on specif problem that requir the simultan us and synergi of variou type of expertis thi is what enea ha alwai done in the past for the complex program for nuclear power station a veri interest program that ha been recent manag by enea ha been the antarct project the agenc wa abl to pour it technic scientif and manageri abil into thi program enea receiv merit for have enabl itali to present itself on the intern scene in full dress a modern base wa construct in a short time and the qualiti of the research program carri out ha allow us to becom on of the nation of the antarct treati with full right and to collabor with equal scientif digniti with the other countri that ar alreadi present such as the unit state and franc but the antarct program is a paradigm from anoth point of view in the sens that enea doe not deal onli with those aspect that it find more congeni such as the system engin and logist that requir extrem complex oper and the us of advanc technolog but doe so in close collabor with other research bodi the scientif program is multidisciplinari and enea although it is also present at thi level ha a minor posit with respect to the cnr italian nation research council and the univers that plai the major part prestipino what direct will the new enea take will it turn toward pure research or to a closer collabor with industri cabibbo it will pass through research but also through it applic enea is abl to do valid research and as the institut duti of enea also includ direct intervent such as those on the environ we ar direct our work toward the concret problem of the countri in order for thi to be possibl and for it to give the result that ar want the agenc must have strong research compon prestipino how is the agenc prepar for it new duti how ar the personnel and the engin be retrain cabibbo technic abil ar easili transfer particularli when you ar work in complex sector for exampl the director of the antarct program is a nuclear engin new expertis is certainli necessari to enter new field but the possibl of self train is also to be valor when we think about train we also think about it as a further field of servic that enea could offer the nation commun cabibbo continu for exampl todai there is an extens request for train that ha arisen from local requir for new expertis result from the necess to look after certain aspect of the safeguard of the environ and to increas energi save enea ha a wealth of expertis to offer in these sector prestipino in a certain sens the reform law ha put enea on the market push it to find it own fund for autonom surviv how is it do cabibbo i would sai well on third of the fund is cover by collabor program with the ministri and with the european commun it is enough to consid that in term of fund intern commiss entrust to enea amount to about 120 billion per year prestipino the south of itali what line of intervent ar plan for thi area by enea cabibbo enea is move toward the actuat of the agreement on the mezzogiorno southern itali program for exampl we have alreadi taken on 55 of the project 80 research at present we ar wait but in the meantim we ar work on a new collabor agreement with the ministri of scientif research we ar not so interest in the valu of the initi be discuss as we ar in it end the goal of such a collabor prestipino energi what is enea do at an intern level to have safe nuclear energi cabibbo examin and review current nuclear technolog follow the referendum is of dramat import for enea an interest point is that our european partner in particular germani that were reluct to accept the commit to a new gener of reactor ar now more dispos to do so work is be done on a new project at a european level enea intend make it own contribut to thi project the epr european pressur reactor becaus it seem to meet our requir in term of social accept the safeti characterist of new reactor can no longer be express in term of probabl the design must be such as to guarante that even the biggest possibl accid ha no consequ either for the environ or for the popul the research for these new gener power station must continu to lead to reactor that ar intrins safe with which in the worst case it would be possibl to lose the reactor itself but without emiss outsid the plant that were abov the safeti level the construct of these plant alreadi technolog possibl depend on a number of factor these be high cost social accept and the problem of manag them enea research program is veri limit with respect to what the agenc wa do in the eighti also becaus the new reactor requir develop and certif at a european level if not at a world level thi is not a road that we can take alon prestipino altern form of energi other countri have move on to their commerci in itali we ar still at the research stage what doe enea intend to do cabibbo the renew sourc that enea is concern with ar wind energi and the energi that can be obtain from biomass such as garbag thei ar alreadi competit particularli if the social cost pollut etc of the tradit sourc of energi ar taken into account howev with respect to what is technolog possibl todai itali is behind as far as the us of energi deriv from the wind is concern it is necessari to provid incent for the construct and us of thi type of equip as ha been done in denmark and the unit kingdom guarante those that us the equip usual small produc that their energi will be purchas enea ha collabor with two italian industri in the research and develop for the construct of variou model that ar slightli differ from those us in the northern european countri becaus of the lower wind speed found in our region denmark and the unit kingdom ar demonstr that alreadi todai it is possibl to produc abund energi from the wind and to do so at competit price the time is also ripe for us to make the jump in qualiti from research to industri applic it is on thing to construct a singl prototyp unit gener energi from the wind and it is anoth to construct a hundr be abl to count on the economi of scale prestipino and solar energi cabibbo solar energi is less convent than wind energi the energi produc by solar power plant ha a higher cost it is an interest technolog for certain special applic such as isol hous howev it still cannot make an impact on the energi consumpt of the countri solar panel that ar cheaper than those current avail ar necessari if their us is to have a relev impact onc we have gotten over thi problem the solut to which could be found in the come year enea is do a lot of work in thi direct both at the portici center and in collabor with other countri the photovolta cell will becom veri desir both for ecolog motiv and from the aesthet point of view let us not forget that wind power gener have been strongli contest in the unit kingdom becaus accord to some environmentalist the blade of the windmil disfigur the countrysid prestipino in conclus prof cabibbo where is enea go how will it respond to the mani older employe who ar retir earli how will the agenc be renew cabibbo enea is still feel the influenc of nuclear energi which requir an organiz set up that is too burdensom todai as an agenc that dedic itself to other activ it will be necessari to adjust the team the earli retir would be veri posit if it were possibl to bring young peopl into the agenc at present we can onli hire about 10 percent with respect to the number of peopl who ar leav an ideal turnov figur would be 20 30 percent without hire young peopl the agenc is get older two thousand peopl will be leav and it will be necessari to hire at least 600 young peopl dure the next 10 year
