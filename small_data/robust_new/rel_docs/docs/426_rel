or mayb it wasn t the right time in those dai we accept our situat i had a famili after all your parent were alwai tell you your action could bring down problem for the famili three year later when he graduat in 1967 barton didn t even try to appli nor did jackson in 1969 i never imagin that jackson said what i expect wa to becom a steelwork or a miner or move north in time cook found work do

jackson land an assist s job in the citi s engin depart in 1977 he becam a fireman as did barton who left the air forc after ey the new opportun back home differ wai of life onc hire cook barton and jackson found themselv work alongsid white who had grown up in a birmingham far differ from the on thei had inhabit as boi for men like wilk and charl brush black colleagu were a new experi brush who serv with wilk in fire station 10 and is presid of the local firefight union had never even attend school with black it wa all white then he recal that wa just the wai thing were wilk high school wasn t integr until 1964 and when it final happen he didn t like it i felt it wa forc upon us he recal later i knew black we swam at the same swim hole we d run them out or thei d run us out but we had differ wai of life thei had their wai of life i had mine wilk had join the fire depart in februari 1968 brush in 1972 watch the first black arriv brush recal some irrit among hi colleagu but noth stronger he wa alreadi a lieuten after all when barton wa hire in 1977 some of the black wouldn t tell us their test score brush said some said thei d never took the test but in the late 70s there realli wa no big problem the big rub wa when thei came out with the consent decre we understood there d be some hire of minor but promot were never discuss when you get into promot you re talk about leader of peopl the matter of promot wa inde a more incendiari issu than new hire it wa also more complic although the consent decre requir that half of the new lieuten be black there were onli a few black from which to choos just the hand who had been hire sinc the first lawsuit in 1974 who by 1982 compos 10 of the depart such disproportion ratio made for consider strain when jackson took the lieuten s test in 1982 he rank 60th on the combin score which includ test result and senior point but the citi need to pick the four highest rank black so he becam a lieuten wilk who rank eighth overal did not in 1983 the citi took the two white who rank first and second then pass over 76 other white to promot the black who had rank 80th 83rd and 85th cook the black rank 85th becam a lieuten wilk rank third thi time still did not a year later barton rank 86th among all applic becam a lieuten wilk rank ninth again did not promot critic in 1986 wilk final made lieuten but by then the black were climb higher jackson becam a captain in 1983 as did barton in octob 1988 when jackson made battalion chief in juli 1987 he rank 15th out of sixteen applic thi sequenc of event understand ha provok object those who ar displeas abov all critic what thei consid the citi s exception stark and rapid manner of implement affirm action a better altern would have been to do thi but not go as fast brush said you can t rais the educ level of a class of peopl in a few short year could we have been less intrus counter alexand the citi s attornei what you re realli ask is could we have done it over 30 year instead of six well sure ye we could have but then you wouldn t have dealt with the problem for two gener to some extent judgment about how birmingham implement it affirm action plan depend on the import assign to the firefight score on the written test some peopl valu the test and frankli believ that the black aren t capabl or disciplin enough to studi for them other howev suggest that the test ar a white man s game skew toward those who write and administ them and more than a few argu that pencil and paper test ar not in ani event the best wai to evalu firefight thei ask why not measur abil to lead or act not memor why not put peopl in situat and see how thei react how about a test for braveri for reaction time in moment of crisi for abil to follow order for abil to lead for quick as it happen such a notion provid common ground for some black and white otherwis pit against each other the white firefight after all would rather have a new test than a system that ignor test result entir we ar not wed to the current paper test brush said it s up to the citi to choos but then appli the result evenli that call for equiti howev is not so easi to provid plea such as brush s eventu focu attent on the irksom difficulti at the heart of affirm action plan their unavoid trade off result ar never appli evenli whatev the juggl with test and labor ratio the minor ar suppos to prevail in the pursuit of equiti there is a loss of equiti some gain some lose in birmingham as elsewher the loser in thi equat simpli ar no longer inclin to accept their fate without a fight iron group that wilk and brush present toil in fire station 10 report to barton is a circumst thei find utterli gall it doe not help that wilk wa the station s rank offic an act captain until barton s arriv a year

but to give them preferenti treatment on basi of race brush arriv at the station soon after ad hi thought hell it s not fair not right to give job or promot on the basi of skin color we didn t discrimin against anyon don t hang it on us we weren t the on who put up the no black appli sign i want to shake these peopl and sai so you ar go to do it to me discrimin against me on the basi of race and now it s all right it wasn t then and it isn t now i realli believ the american peopl have had enough of the idea that everyon should have the same qualiti car and food if there wa a referendum in thi countri you couldn t get approv for quota and you couldn t get it through congress no wai it would be suicid for a politician to propos a system like our here in birmingham peopl have had enough i know i have the black do not by and larg respond with equal fervor their more lacon comment provid a remind of just who ha prevail in all war there ar casualti cook said shrug not everyon come out clear those peopl thei re casualti of war it s not total fair but wa it fair that i couldn t be a fireman back in the 60s jackson said if there had been black firemen in 1962 there wouldn t have been a consent decre in the first place as the talk about fair build cook like to invok a stori concern the first alabama bank your daddi goe there rob that bank then he bui a hous on a hill with the stolen monei bui mom a mink you a jaguar the fbi arriv want to take dad hi hous the mink the jaguar you sai no sir not fair i didn t rob the bank i want to keep the car point is all these thing you have is a result of what happen befor someth that wasn t right when it s time to pai the piper now it s unfair well if you want let s start out zero zero not you 30 point ahead listen to the conflict viewpoint it is clear that somewher in the past 20 year these black and white have swap vision of birmingham where wilk complain of rise crime and express nostalgia for a vanish citi

william to be in the super bowl black can be doug william or bo jackson who s from our neighborhood and now thei can be lieuten cook thei can aspir to thi back then we had no on to aspir to that s import you can sai to yourself now that if i work hard i can be like thi person that s import if thi transform is the triumph of affirm action howev it is also to some reason for it cessat it s precis becaus of improv condit that even a few of those commit to the spirit of the consent decre now express reserv about the need for them in the futur it is essenti for the welfar of a citi that all peopl have a chanc to do well said david vann the progress democrat mayor of birmingham from 1975 to 1979 but there mai be a time when affirm action is no longer an appropri remedi that time mai be come close in come month the rel merit of all the variou argument will be test both in congress and the court civil right organ and their major congression alli soon will introduc legisl that will try to revers martin vs wilk and two other recent suprem court decis relat to affirm action and in the birmingham feder courthous lawyer on dai thi year again will rise to argu whether it is legal to favor minor over white in these forum more than a few of the expert expect the pendulum to continu swing howev slowli awai from the notion of affirm action we will see a flood of revers discrimin case now but thei won t win said craver the georg washington univers law professor onli if thei narrow weber will thei win three or four year from now that s possibl i think the nation is grow increasingli divid posit ar harden certainli that is so in birmingham where matter promis to grow onli more complic with 28 of the fire depart s lieuten now black the citi ha met the consent decre short term goal so the special juggl of the promot rank will soon end regardless of court action that mean the certif list onc again will probabl be all white becaus the black firefight score on the written test and limit senior alon haven t qualifi ani of them for a promot and such all white list in turn will most like trigger renew legal action by black i anticip see both revers discrimin and tradit discrimin
