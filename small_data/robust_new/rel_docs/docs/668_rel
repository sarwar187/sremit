thei do not know that the opium provid them with stimul that creat a fals strength a strength that sap their own bodi the second wai becaus of poverti and backward thei contract diseas thei do not get

no rice their cloth were all rag thei were emaci and sick both wive and husband show displeasur toward each other on their face if thei did not undergo detoxifi treatment thei would die you see my dear journalist we enjoi lot of affect in some villag as we announc the detoxif program avail for 10 addict 30 and 40 peopl show up which made us send sever of them home the subregion 50 physician realli had been work hard in thi total humanitarian task thei had to travel all the wai to hanoi to learn from other physician and to find medic the hanoi physician out of respect for their colleagu taught them the method of treatment and sold them 10 dose of medic at the total price of 3 million dong back at the center thei us three dose on three patient the first dai everyth wa fine the second dai everyth wa fine the third dai oh god the patient either got mad or faint everybodi wa scare stiff order were given to stop the medic in order to look for anoth prescript but which on the ky son district cpv communist parti of vietnam committe secretari cao tien tan had a tradit prescript hand down from hi ancestor which he believ wa good but unfortun he wa in the posit of a district parti secretari what if someth happen in vientian there is a brilliant healer somebodi suggest the center wrote a letter to invit him over have learn from the experi with the hanoi prescript the prospect employ wrote we invit you to come and stai to treat our patient we will provid you with meal and drink after the treatment if it bring about good result we will pai you the full amount of 3 million dong for the 10 dose of medic we will reimburs you for travel expens too the vientian doctor repli that he wa veri busi and that he would onli sell the medic and could not stai at all why it wa obviou that he wa not sure about the result of the treatment final the center had to lose 1 6 million dong as supplement allow paid to him ky son also sent peopl to vinh to bui other medic and final it had to us the district parti secretari s prescript now call tk92 it wa tk92 that help to cure 113 of the 118 case with onli five patient becom addict again becaus of a recurr of their chronic diseas what did thei us to treat these diseas onc again opium and so thei becam addict onc more present patient in van chan district in yen bai provinc and in thai binh provinc have us tk92 with good result but tk92 us for addict in qui chau district ha not brought about ani good result probabl becaus of a failur to follow exactli the physician s prescrib instruct the method that quynh giang villag us to detoxifi addict wa total differ from that us by ky son whether becaus the 57 addict there had violat the honor of a local that had been given the nation public health lead banner or becaus of ani other reason that quynh giang adopt the dictatori measur to bear upon it addict we did not know prior to organ the detoxif program the villag had built four high wall it also put up a barb wire fenc in addit to the medic staff the villag cadr also station four public secur men there then order were issu for hold a meet then peopl were sent out to escort the addict in it wa as noisi as an oper launch to catch a bunch of bandit in the first phase there were 11 detoxif patient after two month a review found that five of them becam addict again in the second phase 12 patient were to receiv treatment but three of them escap becaus of excess fear the nine addict who were caught and taken to the center all went on medic hunger strike and promis that thei would quit the habit by themselv the result obtain in other center were no better than those in quynh giang que phong took in 22 addict for detoxif but four of them escap from the center leav 18 behind after two month a review found that 14 becam addict again in qui chau after two month 18 of 24 patient smoke again in tuong duong after two month 18 of 27 patient smoke again and so exclud the ky son detoxif center onli 24 case were treat sucessfulli in the other four center and yet in thi phase 1 the state had spent 170 million dong it wa becaus of the success and failur in phase 1 that the campaign leader have chang the wai to manag it sinc the middl of 1993 the nghe an public health servic ha been in charg of the detoxif program in the provinc perhap thi is the right approach medic speak drug addict is a diseas sinc it is a diseas treatment must come from physician question mark remain after more than a year of detoxif in nghe an we must reluctantli ask these question can nghe an save the more than 6 000 peopl the pitiabl and reproach peopl from the viciou cycl of addict when is thi mission of salvat over it is difficult for anybodi to offer an answer howev thi is not the onli pain we do not know whether some adolesc malaria patient and peopl afflict by stomach diseas stomach ach and so on ar get close to opium and befriend it at the same time when statistician ar ad and subtract figur or not we do not know whether dure the two year in which nghe an succeed in save those 150 peopl from opium addict the same number of peopl might have been caught in the trap of opium the most import issu which most absolut requir action is to destroi the sourc of materi it is just that simpl it is complic too if we try to know everyth we will find that veri mani hmong villag live on grow poppi a coupl who grow poppi harvest from 1 5 to 2 5 kilogram of opium in each product season the price of a kilogram of opium at it sourc is 1 million dong accord to it plan nghe an provinc will spend 2 3 billion dong to help ethnic group to bui cow pig seedl and so on in order to switch from grow poppi to grow other crop is it all right that wai to be more exact is it complet all right that wai what is the us of rais cow and pig and find nobodi to bui them becaus the terrain consist onli of mountain chasm and hilli land where there ar no mean of commun at all thi mean that we must build road if that sum of monei 2 3 billion dong from the bank of vietnam is also spent on build road and bridg it will be just a drop in the bucket there also is thi question becaus the highland of nghe an had onc produc 14 ton of opium a year and still had been get ton of the same stuff from across the border when thi stuff becom scarc how much of it 2 ton or 4 ton will we expect to see sweep across the border now and so we still cannot stop worri about the unexpect consequ of thi black demon that is call opium vinh octob 1993

prepar thi book came in 1989 enorm chang go on in both russia and on the whole territori of the former soviet union have trigger it old stereotyp were collaps paradigm were chang and the author of the book could more easili renounc some environment and econom concept domin and still domin the world an import incent to creat thi book ha been the fact that the assess of consumpt and preemption of the primari biolog product by mankind at the global level had been evalu and publish in russia word in russian 1980 well befor the wide cite paper of p vitousek et al 1986 with veri similar conclus appear though the signific of the gorshkov s public ha not been properli appreci by the commun of expert in the issu of global environ even in russia it conclus have influenc the environment think in our countri that could not but make the author to think over the etern question where do we go an import event without which thi book could not have been creat wa the crucial step from rather gener statement on the theoric exist of limit for econom activ within the biospher to the quantit estim of it along within the indic of when mankind step over thi most import bound russian word 1987 russian word 1990 it will be shown in thi book that cross thi ecolog borderlin ha occur time ego as publish and that the global environment chang observ the last decad worrisom confirm it the competit between the two main econom system in the world is over signifi the defeat of the central plan economi the latter requir higher manag expenditur but it is quickli out of order as soon as the tight central control is loosen it function doe not correspond to the main principl of sustain function of both the biospher and the human societi which is the self control and fine tune balanc of matter and energi flux within the system that is the susten of a homeostasi it turn out also that the central plan econom system is more wast in term of the natur resourc us howev the market economi is not abl to solv the global environment problem either to fulfil the need of predominantli poverti striken planet s grow popul both system strive for quick and massiv product lavishli deplet natur resourc a realiti of todai is that we face a collaps world be in a state of sever environment crisi and convert into an overal crisi of our civilis the strategi of sustain develop our common futur 1987 and mani other public is an attempt to handl the crisi it is the main stereotyp of our time base in fact on expect of a miracl sustain develop is an endeavour to minim man s impact on the environ in an expect that the life support system would maintain it main function until the popul of the earth stabil at the level exceed two or more time the present on and would keep on after that it is doubt whether the miracl would ever happen a polit foundat of the sustain develop strategi is a desir to preserv the statu quo in the world correct and mend the present world system and postpon the moment of the unpleas truth the truth is that the sustain develop strategi is certainli progress for some transit period but in the long run it all the same drive mankind to the ecolog impass that is to the extinct of man as a biolog speci the author ar far awai from the point that the econom growth or the technolog revolut ar the culprit of the emerg global environment catastroph renounc that civilis can be compar with jump out of a speed train that is perish the main reason of the crisi is in the excess grown popul of the planet it ha increas to such an extent that it stabil even at the present level would not bring the biospher back to the pre crisi sustain state thi statement is also a challeng of a kind becaus thi approach doe not correspond to the deep root ideolog religion and ethic norm base on the usual person anthropocentr the issu of the popul growth and control ar of cours veri sensit polit problem and the interrel of the planet s overpopul and the global environment crisi often ar not put on the foreground upreced complex and the world wide scale of the problem of mankind s surviv under the environment crisi predetermin a crucial need of the intern cooper it is the object of the unit confer on environ and develop the unc ha becom on of the reason to publish thi book now the structur of the book is determin by the concept express abov it consist of two part the first on is devot to an analysi of the world s develop particularli dure the last forti year social and environment implic of the develop ar discuss an origin concept of environment secur is suggest base on thi concept the present state of the world environ is character as an acut ecolog crisi in the second part the state of the environ in russia is discuss keep in mind that it is a larg part of the world system state of the environ in russia is regard in the framework of the concept of environment secur suggest in the first part to describ the ecolog situat in russia the report of the environ of the former ussr as well as the statist refer book have been us thei contain for the first time mani data unpublish earlier the main assess ar for 1989 as the text of the book wa be prepar in 1990 part 1 environment imper the end of the xxth centuri can be characteris by the drastic chang in the relat between the two princip state and econom system it is the result of histor develop which ha stimul the human societi as a whole and everi individu human be on earth to work out a new mental the basic effect of the new mental is the fact that due to the effort of both east and west the world ha been

strong aggrav of the global environment crisi a thorough analysi of thi situat is necessari on the ev of the un confer on environ and develop to be held in brazil 1 12 june 1992 seek for problem solv strategi leader of mani state often rais ecolog problem a great deal of top level meet have produc declar on the environ the greatest attent wa probabl attract to the bruntland report and to the

uncertainti is gener felt as to the wai of solv ecolog problem develop strategi for environment safeti and mean to guarante sustain develop assess of the current global environment situat vari from optimist on it is necessari to prevent a possibl environment crisi to moder pessimist on the planet is on the threshold of crisi at region level howev the most pessimist assess have been given such as a sever environment crisi etc mani expert concern with the ecolog problem discuss the issu of permiss load on ecosystem but thei do not give ani unambigu answer to the question what ar the limit of the load on the ecosystem or on the biospher as a whole there ar declar claim that it is possibl to feed a popul of 10 billion peopl and more but the estim ar not base on accur analysi of the environment condit in which the 10 billion peopl ar suppos to live if thei ar abl to surviv at all these question should be answer and the answer formul within the concept of environment safeti howev the concept of environment safeti ha not been adequ formul so far nor have the answer been given to the abov pose question except a few suggest 2 5 15 there ar two concept of environment safeti that ar be consid at the present the first more popular on is base on the idea that ecolog problem and environment chang ar relat to wrong manag of the economi therefor the economi should be modifi to make it ecolog safe and not harm for the environ that is the technolog should be wasteless and ecolog clean energi sourc should be us the other concept of environment safeti proce from an intuit belief that it is necessari to conserv a certain part of biospher and keep it free from ani econom activ it is assum that thi part of biospher is necessari to keep in order to sustain the environ but no assess ar given as to the threshold area of the preserv territori for sustain biospher the first concept actual admit the possibl of complet destruct of the natur biospher sinc it assum an unlimit econom activ which would not result in the degrad of the environ a solut of ani environment problem is assum to be possibl through us adequ method of econom develop and the utilis of effici environment manag system the second concept propos the solut of the problem through preserv of part of the biospher against it possibl destruct the final object of both concept is provis of equilibrium and wasteless manag to accomplish the task howev an enorm control system of unpreced complex and scale would be need which could ensur a sustain develop in the absenc of unperturb biota function accord to the le chateli principl 2 5 thu there is no essenti differ between both concept system of thi type ar often refer to as the noospher estim of the inform flow to be process by such a control system and of expenditur requir for it oper show us that such a system cannot be practic realis if the system had been creat howev the maintain of it stabil would have requir over 99 of the total energi and labour produc by mankind recent a new concept ha been propos which attribut the appear of environment problem to excess consumpt todai the output of matter per capita result from mine industri agricultur and forest cat amount to 20 ton annual subsequ process of these 20 ton of raw materi requir 2 5x03 of energi power and 800 ton of water the final product intend for direct consumpt ar about 2 ton the remain part is direct technolog wast wherea the 2 ton of final product ar delai wast the concept assum that the problem might be solv by reduc individu consumpt in realiti howev the optim individu consumpt valu in a modern industri societi doe not exce the basic need of a human be which ar necessari to maintain an adequ standard of live for exampl it is obviou that it is imposs to live in a multistorei apart hous without elev water suppli or sewag facil therefor to call for the individu reduct of consumpt would be similar to the call for the refus from civilis it is unlik that such a strategi of surviv would be support by the public opinion and that the propaganda of thi principl would receiv a posit respons sinc these idea do not compli with the natur need and aspir of a human be in all time variou religion and ideolog us to take account of these aspir while call for temporari absenc and promis in the end a golden ag heaven liberti equal and fratern or even to everyon accord to hi need the strategi of reduc consumpt promis noth but at first sight a gloomi futur each of concept describ abov ha a ration core the first on relat environment problem to the econom activ the second on proce from the assumpt that the sustain of the sever perturb but control biospher is the basic for surviv the third concept state that it is consumpt that caus environment degrad rather than it final stage which is popul besid thi last concept shift the center of graviti in solv environment problem from the sphere of technolog and economi to that of human behaviour not a singl on of these concept howev offer an unambigu solut of the problem outlin nevertheless the solut concept of environment safeti refus from the outdat ecolog stereotyp alter of the environment paradigm biospher the guarantor of life conserv the object the environment research is a guedt as print for sustain condit of life for human of the present and futur gener to determin what these condit ar the genet and cultur hered of man should be investig human exist in the environ and have been abl to establish empir long ago that environment degrad depriv man of normal live condit thi put forward an essenti new problem whether the commun of natur speci in the biospher determin the state of the environ in which human be exist and whether carbon and nutrient concentr in the environ ar occasion factor for the biota or thei ar form by the biota itself and maintain at a level optim for the life 2 17 if the biolog control sustain of the environ exist there aris a need for conserv of the commun of natur speci in the biospher and of determin of the threshold valu for non sustain perturb of the biospher if thi is not the case then the environment problem is reduc entir to that of manag of the economi it is a known fact that the carbon and nutrient concentr in the environ can chang by 100 due to geophys process take place dure of about 100 000 year therefor dure the phanerozo era for exampl the concentr could have vari by hundr of time thu make imposs the exist of ani form of life the fact that thi ha never happen point out to the control role of the biospher the thin film of life on the earth s surfac becom a filter which regul concentr of the carbon and nutrient provid a biogeochem equilibrium with an exceedingli high accuraci up to hundredth of on percent 10 sup 4 the mechan of thi regul is ensur under natur biodivers condit due to the synthesi of organ matter from inorgan on and decomposit of organ matter into inorgan compon it is worth mention here that accord to the exist predict about a million speci of plant and anim ar under the danger of extinct over the next 2 3 decad the characterist time of cycl for the basic element in the environ due to biolog product and destruct is of the order of 10 year i e it is 10 sup 4 time shorter than that of geophys process therefor the biota can compens the extern perturb or occasion fluctuat of the environment properti over a short time period the conclus is support by the sustain of the environ observ over long time period of about a thousand year the biota compens the growth of inorgan matter concentr in the environ by transform thi matter into low activ organ form but if necessari the biota increas inorgan concentr by decompos organ matter to restor the close natur of the biogeochem cycl thi properti of the natur biota is similar to the function of the le chateli principl which provid physic and chemic sustain equilibrium state 2 18 it is obviou that in order to provid thi control the reserv of carbon and nutrient in organ and inorgan compound of the environ should be of the same order of magnitud which is actual the case for most element continu process of the biolog synthesi and decomposit sustain the environ in non equilibrium physic and chemic state which ar easili disturb in case of sever perturb or destruct of the biota for instanc the chemic composit of the atmospher is in a state of non equilibrium the low co sup 2 concentr in the atmospher is sustain due to the function of the ocean biota it form the vertic gradient of the co sup 2 concentr and decreas the near surfac and consequ atmospher co sup 2 concentr in the ocean by approxim a factor of 3 in comparison with that at greater debt should biota be destruct in the upper layer of the ocean the co sup 2 concentr in the atmospher would have increas by about a factor of 3 thi is a spectacular exampl of reveal the role of the biota in the control of environment condit thu the exist bodi of knowledg tell us that by us solar radiat as an energi sourc the biota sustain the environ under the condit optim for life by compens occasion fluctuat extern geophys perturb and non biolog chang in the environ the concept of the biolog control environment sustain is in conflict with the fundament concept of biologi that is the abil of speci to adapt themselv to ani environment chang caus by geophys factor the adapt mean a chang in the biota due to environment impact wherea the impact of biota on the environ ar assum to be accident and not compens geophys chang therefor environment condit ar optim for the biota adapt to such condit and there ar no other specif condit that would be optim for the biota final the continu adapt of biota to environment chang determin it evolut in the cours of which a programm for the adapt of everi speci in optim onli the best adapt speci surviv and us genet inform consist in the adapt to the environ thi concept contain a number of contradict 1 if environment chang ar determin by geophys process it is not clear why these chang had not ever surpass the threshold where life is not possibl 2 if adapt follow continu the chang environment condit it is not clear why there ar no transient form between ani two speci either in space i e among speci exist simultan or in time i e accord to the paleontolog data it is known howev that speci preserv morpholog constanc and strict discret to remov these contradict it is necessari to alter the earlier paradigm and assum that although the inform on the adapt of speci to environment chang is necessari much more import is the inform on the function of speci feed behaviour popul densiti etc which is requir to stabil the environ and is carri out by speci within a specif commun thi viewpoint provid a consist explan of biolog control environment sustain which remov the first contradict of the earlier paradigm the idea propos do not deni evolut which within the framework of a new paradigm turn out to be a supplementari process aris spontan in the exist inform molecular structur of biota due to doubl trebl and more simultan mutat it creat a barrier which is difficult to overcom for the transit from an old to a new speci thi explain the sustain and the discret natur of each speci thu remov the second contradict a possibl mechan can be a horizont transfer of the gemon fragment form by singl cell procariot which alon can creat combin of doubl trebl and more simultan mutat due to their abund and high frequenc of their gener thu a new concept of the environment safeti is propos which is base on the assumpt that the environ is geophys unstal and that it is the biota that is the stabil factor sustain the rnviron within the limit provid the condit for life thi concept make it possibl to give answer to question which remain unansw within earlier concept of the environment safeti sustain limit it is obviou that the compens of the perturb of the biota and the environ i e the accomplish of the le chateli principl is onli possibl up to a certain threshold of perturb the high accuraci of the balanc between synthesi and decomposit in ecosystem is ensur by a great number of competit interest speci or their part for exampl plant root or leav fungi and microb in soil in thi case the rel fluctuat is proport to i n where n is a number of noncorrel part of the system ecosystem alwai compris larg anim whose number is subject to consider variat but nevertheless thei do not contribut significantli to chang in the biogeochem equilibrium sinc it ha been establish empir that their portion of consumpt their particip in the destruct of organ matter doe not exce l analysi of the behaviour of the atmospher carbon ha reveal that prior to the past centuri the land biota follow the la chateli becaus it wa perturb onli slightli by mankind the biota had compens man s impact on the biospher the problem of environment conserv did not aris and the biomass of the continent biota increas in respons to the growth of the atmospher carbon concentr howev in the past centuri possibl from the begin of the xixth centuri the land biota ceas to absorb the excess of co sup 2 from the atmospher on the contrari biota start to emit carbon dioxid to the atmospher thu increas instead of decreas environment pollut result from the industri emiss therefor it is necessari to determin the threshold at which the le chateli principl ceas to function in the preindustri time the area of man exploit land wa less than 5 of the entir land territori the human util there about 20 of the biotic product i e the part of the biotic product consum did not exce on percent on a global scale that wa within the quota allow for big vertebr overgraz of pastur by domest anim is a convinc demonstr of the exist of such a threshold if local anthropogen impact exce the sustain threshold local perturb appear and pollut gradual is accumul in the environ with the flux of it toward the adjac area the area of environment perturb is determin by a certain characterist radiu of the zone outsid which the impact of pollut on the biota is at the sustain threshold for unperturb biota the pollut can be reduc at a local spot by us a close technolog cycl or by increas diffus or final by remov the pollut from the local todai the environment manag is base on permiss concentr limit or permiss emiss limit these limit ar not relat to the sustain threshold and repres strictli speak onli the extent of social or public concern in environment problem the zone where the sustain threshold ha been surpass is extend as perturb grow the sustain state of the global biospher can exist until the unperturb part of the biospher is abl to compens all the man made perturb i e until the sustain threshold is exceed on a global scale the environment chang observ at the present time definit show that the sustain threshold ha inde been exceed on a global scale the estim avail reveal that present the human consumpt of the primari biolog product on the land amount to 40 while variou kind of econom activ cover 63 million km sup 2 of land as ha been mention abov at the begin of the 19th centuri the terrestri biota absorb less carbon dioxid than it releas to the atmospher as a result of econom activ the direct of the net carbon dioxidflx as print chang sinc then the biospher ha becom an addit sourc of carbon dioxid increas it emiss to the atmospher in addit to industri emiss besid almost 6 gt of co sup 2 releas to the atmospher from fossil fuel burn a similar amount of co sup 2 is emit by degrad terrestri biota the ocean biota ha so far been disturb onli slightli and therefor it absorb g st of co sup 2 annual in accord with the le chateli principl about 2 gt of co sup 2 is absorb by the aquat biota in inorgan form due to physicochem process wherea approxim 4 gt of co sup 2 is ad annual to 700 gt of carbon dioxid which is present in the atmospher these figur character the global carbon cycl a consider man made impact ha been observ in the inland part of the global hydrolog cycl the global river runoff from the contin is equal to the water influx by the atmospher from the ocean in the absenc of terrestri biota the amount of precipit on the land should be determin mainli by the volum of water transport from the ocean and by the evapor from inland water bodi becaus bare rock would either suck water or let it run off biota with a high leaf area index drastic increas the return of water to the atmospher due to transpir thu sustain a close water cycl and provid two third of the precipit on land so biota is respons for 70 of precipit on land in an unperturb forest up to 90 of solar energi is absorb by the foliag surfac and is us for transpir while less than 40 of solar radiat is absorb by agroecosystem therefor dure the whole histori of human race the clear and replac of forestland by pastur cropland settlement road etc could have reduc transpir by almost on half for natur plant commun and agroecosystem over the ussr territori a water transfer index ha been determin it is a ratio between a variabl of precipit and a variabl of total evapor dure the veget period thi ratio for forest and wetland is 2 5 3 0 for meadow and stepp is 1 5 2 0 for agroecosystem in the area of volga river and in the northern caucasu thi ratio drop down to 0 8 1 1 i e the water control capac of the agroecosystem is low over the whole period of human histori thi ratio ha been reduc on the averag for land by a factor of 1 6 a result of perturb of the land biota is desertif which went on dure the entir period of human histori in summari on can conclud that the human activ includ the consumpt of energi 90 of which is obtain from nonrenew resourc ha result in such a sever impact on the biospher that the latter ha lost it capabl to sustain balanc biogem as print cycl within the necessari degre of accuraci the biospher ha lost it potenti to restor the properti of environ and to sustain it optim state requir for the susten of life the degrad biospher ha itself becom a sourc of pollut and destabil of the global environ we believ that the propos concept of global environment safeti provid answer to fundament problem which remain unsolv within the scope of the previou concept perspect for surviv as ha been suggest abov on ha everi reason to believ that onli the biospher which consist of the biota and the environ interact with it is capabl to sustain the environ provid that extern perturb do not exce a permiss threshold that is the biospher function accord to the le chateli principl that is why the conserv of natur commun and the exist speci in amount reassur the function of the le chateli principl with regard to perturb is the basic condit for the continu of life on the earth and the surviv of the human race the modern civil doe not ensur thi it ha also brought about a discrep between the genet programm of a human be and hi present ecolog nich which should lead to the degrad of the gemon of man thi last problem mean an extrem import of the popul genet research effort should be direct toward seek for new data and obtain more precis inform in support of the concept of the biolog control to sustain the environ for thi purpos global monitor of biolog cycl should be improv first of all that of the carbon cycl more reliabl assess of the biolog primari product should be made both on the global and region scale part of the land and ocean which ar subject to exception strong anthropogen impact should be identifi carbon dioxid emiss by the land biota should be calcul on the basi of observ and region of the most intens emiss should be singl out to solv these and other problem it is necessari to correct the relev nation and intern research programm all system of environment monitor and model should be reorient with due attent to the prioriti aspect of the global environment safeti the first and foremost object to be achiev is to reduc the man made perturb of the biospher thu guarante recoveri of the adequ function of the le chateli principl in the biospher on ha stop the expans of econom activ on a global scale in order to save those biospher region which have not degrad due to civil thei might becom the sourc for recoveri of the entir biospher sinc the biota possess a power mechan of self control it is particularli essenti to conserv forest and wetland as the most product system of the biospher among these commun the tropic forest ar of particularli vital import becaus thei ar concentr of the biodivers and their product exce that of the temper forest by a factor of 4 it is also extrem import to make a thorough inventori of the preserv part of the biospher make us of all avail observ mean includ satellit remot sens some region should be singl out as particularli protect natur reserv it is connect of special interest ar polar zone high mountain area and desert it would be veri reason to begin with proclaim the entir contin as a reserv among other major action ar the follow further transit to the resourc and energi save technolog creation of the wast treatment facil to reduc the zone of pollut load on the biota due to local man made effect these ar the task for the transit period and their accomplish would lessen the antropogen stress on the biospher a perspect object which would make it possibl to solv the biospher preserv problem radic is the reduct of energi consumpt by approxim a factor of 10 thi would decreas the man made perturb of the terrestri biota by an order of magnitud and enabl it

if under the term of a sustain develop on mean improv of the qualiti of human life while live within the carri capac of support ecosystem care 1991 p 10 the main question which ar necessari to answer befor ani strategi can be elabor ar as follow if on accept that the surviv and sustain develop of mankind is imposs without preserv natur commun of organ ecosystem landscap etc then it is necessari to understand the function mechan which ensur the life on the earth includ the life of human if it is accept that the biospher ha a limit carri capac then it is necessari to determin the limit of the

would depend on the answer to the abov question thi book ha made an attempt to answer these question to defin the strategi for the xxi centuri most import is the conclus that mankind in it develop ha alreadi some time ago exceed the carri capac of the biospher natur commun ar be destroi and under these condit social develop cannot be sustain have exceed the limit of consumpt permit by natur by on order of magnitud mankind ha disturb the stabil of the biospher thi led to the deform of the environ the sustain of which cannot be maintain by the deterior biota that is why on ha to rais the problem of mankind s surviv as it main goal for the long term histor perspect the sustain develop strategi can be accept for the present transit stage the problem of human surviv is connect to the need to decreas energi consumpt by on order of magnitud and therefor with the correspond reduct of the number of peopl live on the earth the object is not in slow down the increment and not in the stabil of popul in the futur but in it consider diminut as compar with the current number we talk about a veri peac well accept and understood process as oppos to the chao and suffer of veri mani peopl which ar inevit while passiv expect the stabil at the level of 10 12 billion the goal of consider reduct of the world popul as compar with it present rapid growth is incred complex to achiev and veri difficult

histori our peopl s current impoverish situat and deplor live condit which ar even wors in the indian zone of our dioces can be explain by the action of institut that have develop over 500 year of our histori 4 1 the conquest for the indian pueblo the conquest meant subjug and exploit by the colon such subjug and exploit took sever differ form depend on extern interest and local protest against the brutal that wa inflict on the indigen peopl and the trampl of their digniti slaveri gave wai to the encomienda land and inhabit grant to a conquistador which in turn gave wai to the parcel out of indian pueblo at the same time that the tax system wa stabil amid thi onslaught onli a few peopl were abl to keep possess of their land under normal condit even in the area of sanctuari 4 2 independ mexico the up and down of nation independ and later the first modern with the reform and industri promot by porfirio diaz led to the growth and develop of the mexican hacienda with it pattern of forc labor differ from region to region with the hacienda came the predomin of the system of perman resid rural estat peon uncultiv land and servant these trend led to a greater concentr of land in privat hand and to a declin in the land own and control by the indian pueblo these were the dai of the sinist stori about the oper to extract chicl and fanci wood from the tropic jungl or the factori that produc sugar and spirit in more humid region 4 3 the mexican revolut and the agrarian reform the faction that triumph in the mexican revolut sought to chang the institut of land tenur with it agrarian reform propos aim at quiet the demand and rebellion of the peasant thi wa the reason for the variou regul govern small scale properti wherebi commun asset were restor and deed and larg hacienda were redistribut in the form of the ejido and the new ejido popul center the uneven pace and scope of these measur ar well document asid from their complex stormi histori the agrarian reform had a shine moment in chiapa under lazaro cardena when the first ejido were establish and deed were issu for the first commun asset dure subsequ period thi process slow and fail to keep pace with the rest of the countri we saw peonag system in indian region of chiapa as late as the 1980 s in contrast product such as coffe cacao tobacco and banana were be export from modern plantat and area of forest and jungl were be open up and clear for extens ranch and graze 4 4 the neoliber agenda of modern we call it thi becaus start with the year of so call stabil develop in our countri the 1950 s and more emphat sinc the 1970 s chiapa began to be view as a strateg region in econom and nation secur term chiapa is a border state near central america possess of signific resourc that could bring in foreign exchang hydroelectr power oil deposit and the tourism appeal of natur beauti shot through with mayan histori the crisi of the industri countri and the fall in oil price in the first half of the 1980 s made the burden of the foreign debt intoler for the econom system the state then took it first neoliber macroeconom auster measur which carri a high price for the most vulner strata and class the govern of presid salina intensifi and hone these measur to modern and reform the structur of the economi and the state retain control of the more strictli polit concess and seek a new wai to incorpor the mexican economi into the intern system reli on the free trade agreement with the unit state and canada as the touchston of thi effort it manag the social problem aris from the expand area of poverti and extrem poverti by make discretionari us of it conting fund the result of a leaner public sector through pronasol nation solidar program the oper arm of so call social liber from thi perspect we ar now live in what we could call the second modern of the countrysid in chiapa it is take place amid a protract drop in world coffe price precis when agrarian conflict ar intensifi and spread in accord with the criteria of previou agrarian legisl chiapa account for 27 percent of the nation s backward agrarian sector the spearhead of thi agrarian modern movement is the reform of articl 27 of the constitut and the new agrarian law the goal is typic modern to remov obstacl so that land can be turn into merchandis and thu privat investor can bui it up or form joint invest ventur the consequ that ar actual in the of ar the destruct of the land s mean to the commun the concentr of ownership and migrat from the countrysid to the citi particularli as a result of the program to certifi ejido right proced a legal requir for the purchas and sale of ejido land 5 the burden of recent decad salient problem 5 1 high degre of unrest given thi wide rang panorama of asymmetri and inequ it is no surpris that recent decad in our dioces have been mark by an extrem high level of unrest in the indigen zone the most vulner group in thi structur framework have been establish their own organ and method of struggl to demand their right to land and better live condit it ha not been an easi road rather it ha been mark by violent respons from those who benefit from the statu quo nonetheless the difficulti themselv have forc the indian pueblo to mobil against hunger exploit and repress in variou wai march sit in demonstr hunger strike etc 5 2 guatemalan refuge moreov the sociopolit conflict in guatemala and the respons of the guatemalan state and militari have also forc the peopl and commun ravag by the militari s scorch earth polici to flee into our countri and seek refug in mexican commun along the border which have respond with solidar and like good christian along with other nation and intern organ todai more than a decad ha pass and there ar hope sign that thei will be abl to return for exampl in earli januari we and the believ peopl of the dioces watch as some 2 500 of our guatemalan refuge brother made an organ return to their countri 5 3 the expuls sinc the 1970 s we have also had to confront the pain problem of indian who have been expel as individu and in group from their municip and commun both our evangel and cathol brother have been victim thi develop ha forc us to spotlight freedom of religion and to expos the polit and econom interest of the caciqu govern structur which ar given to intoler and deal with the state thi situat ha also requir an ecumen dialogu at variou level and ha prompt our offer of humanitarian aid and counsel in defens of the human right of the affect group famili and individu what we find truli extraordinari is the testimoni of mani famili that have been expel cathol and evangel alik who have prefer to be strip of their home land and domest anim rather than renounc their faith those who have sign some document assert that thei have chang religion to avoid be expel can be count on the finger of on hand regardless of their religi differ the peopl who have been expel have organ movement to defend their right and have achiev signific result 5 4 discrimin and inequ although the state that emerg from the mexican revolut ha tend to present itself as the guarantor of a nationalist ident into which an indigen compon ha been incorpor racism and discrimin ar still rampant in these region although there have been offici and semioffici attempt to reduc all form of poverti when we examin their result we see that the structur of inequ of the socioeconom system itself have outweigh them discrimin can be seen in all form of poverti and in the predomin of polit control to counter organ express of protest or dissent that pose just demand but thi blight is most obviou in the administr of justic and respect for human right our dioces s record in recent year contain a frighten number of report of trump up charg unlaw arrest tortur impun unjust imprison mistreat in prison evict etc therefor it is not subject to argu that all human and social relationship in chiapa ar shot through with inequ and ting with oppress and domin which becom part of the collect conscious more than elsewher in the countri the ident of men and women from chiapa reflect thi situat in mani wai the clearest differ can be seen in the case of the indian not onli becaus of their race but also their econom and social statu strip of their land the indian ar stranger in their own land thi state of affair is repeat among the nativ who live on the fring of nation societi and whose land ar be settl with all of the consequ thereof expropri of their land the pillag of their natur habitat and the loss of their cultur in the citi the differ ar just as great albeit less appar the wai peopl deal with each other make these inequ clear and thei becom heighten in time of social conflict these differ have becom intern and ar reflect in the role that each is call upon to plai in societi the poor in chiapa ar the indian the peasant the worker the sick the mestizo the children the women those who do not have influenti friend the expel the jobless and the low incom earner 5 5 the 1994 polit transit in recent week our countri ha been engulf in a seri of veri worrisom violent event these develop have reveal that drug traffick is link to polic judici and polit institut regrett the offici version of the death of our brother cardin juan jesu posada ocampo ha succeed onli in underscor the peopl s widespread mistrust of govern institut in the midst of the 1994 polit transit thi ha been compound by the scant credibl of elector process and mechan which ar taint by the control that the state and it parti have over them in thi specif regard mani have point out that as long as thi situat persist the democrat of our polit system will remain an unfulfil wish there ar seriou fear that if thi barrier remain it will lead to confront and strain among polit player outsid the institut rule and accord the present moment is mark both by sign of a rel open and by the resurg of polit demand that have long gone unmet 5 6 injustic and the respons of the dioces as part of our christian commit to the indian and peasant of the southern pacif region we have been point out the grave situat and the subhuman condit in which our brother ar live thi situat ha been worsen becaus our system ha creat new form of polit exploit and legal injustic that legitim oppress and repress cultur ar under ideolog assault and be strip of their fundament valu the list of injustic done to the indigen peopl in our dioces over the past 500 year is a veri long on in light of the challeng pose by modern life and the harsh of neoliber both thei and we alongsid them have seen that poverti is in and of itself an evil that is total contrari to god s will the church ha been abl to fulfil it prophet mission at variou time through promin figur and work it cannot be deni howev that at other time it ha grown worldli whether by ideolog legitim the organ of coloni govern or the independ state or by enjoi privileg when it us the tool of the prevail system to gain properti and power thi local church which is mark mainli by frai bartolom de la casa s evangel loyalti ha chosen in recent decad to take it place on the fring of societi alongsid the veri poor in other word the former dioces of chiapa whose first bishop wa frai bartolom de la casa a steadfast defend of the indian and implac critic of the coloni system ha been character by it pastor line becaus the dread condit that he fought against ar still present particularli after the second vatican council the presenc of pastor agent from the dioces priest brother and commit laymen in a situat of unrest set us on a long path that ha also meant a long process of convers the indigen commun which make up the major of the popul and is the most disadvantag segment of societi requir that we make our presenc felt urgent if we want to remain faith to the gospel thi is why our dioces bear the characterist inher to pastor action among the indian by such pastor action we do not mean just concern for the nativ rather it is an embodi of our presenc in their world which is full of both shortcom and grand valu we see it as an experi that guid our reflect about our faith our pastor activ and our aspir as a church to move toward the emerg of an autochthon church that will be abl to tell of it salvif histori express itself in their cultur enrich itself with their valu embrac their suffer struggl and aspir and through the strength of the gospel transform and liber their cultur as on indian man said year ago to the apostol deleg at the time unless the church becom tzeltal with the tzeltal indian chol with the chol indian and tojolab with the tojolab indian i do not see how it can call itself the cathol church it would actual be an upstart church belong to a rule social class alien to the indian the religi schizophrenia that indian have experienc sinc the war of conquest will not disappear until thei ar accultur in the gospel in a wai that bear fruit in their own minist in a faith that is reflect in their own cultur wai and in the celebr of the sacrament with their own ethnic express ad gent 6 with thi pastor option our church through it children join with men of ani statu but especi the poor and the afflict and devot itself joyfulli to them it share in their joi and sorrow come to know the aspir and enigma of life and suffer with them in their death throe ad gent 12 cf ad gent 11 2 thi option ha brought harass and attack both by the state and by variou privileg group or sector in the econom and sociocultur sphere we have thu had to endur slander propaganda and li over the offici and semioffici mass media intimid the jail of pastor agent the murder of catech and even inter church denunci with guileless peopl manipul and deceiv in short the so call discoveri of america condit the life and integr of the new contin and chang the histori of our peopl it also chang the life of the peopl who look at us with ey of destruct domin greed and the life of those who look upon us with apostol zeal to convei to us their experi of faith and set us on a new path the full benefit of the call to christ s faith to form a church which summon peopl like a light rais on high ar better understood after 500 year and ought to be duli appreci therefor our roman pontiff pope john paul ii put forth the idea of nine year of renew evangel to commemor the 500th anniversari of the meet of the two world inasmuch as the birth of what we todai call latin america wa close link to the proclam of the gospel s messag in our land and although it is true that the evangel wa at time also us as a tool for subject peopl to an unjust colon and it result depred it must also be recogn that it ha been much more power than the shadow that regrett accompani it down through histori 6 the diocesan pastor process 1960 1993 6 1 1 interpret and confid of the peopl as interpret and confid of the peopl we realiz how difficult it is to open the door to hope when the condit under which most peopl live ar so distress and the structur of domin ar so persist that those who devot their live to chang see that all of creation is misus by the evil of the wick those who seek the path of justic becom so upset and frustrat at time that thei do not know what to do and not even what to ask for but we know that the spirit wail within us with indescrib sob that the father can howev understand as the spirit interced with him on our behalf roman 8 18 27 it is precis now that word of encourag ar most need word that ar both specif and that explain why christian have hope todai we wish to support all that we have done and said on it sole true foundat the resurrect the process of the diocesan church that began 33 year ago ha the lord s resurrect as it sourc becaus if christ did not rise again our pastor work and your faith ar in vain the messag of the resurrect is in fact the core that ha given us hope through the variou stage becaus the resurrect is the central mysteri of the faith and the faith ha given us the inspir for everyth that we have done 6 1 2 evangel to evangel is to do what jesu christ did when in the synagogu he show that he had come to evangel the poor luke 4 18 19 be rich he becam poor to enrich us with hi poverti 2 corinthian 8 9 he challeng us to bear genuin wit to evangel poverti in our lifestyl and church structur as he did thi is the foundat of our commit to an evangel and preferenti option for the poor an option that is steadfast and irrevoc but neither exclus nor exclusionari as solemnli affirm at the medellin and puebla confer santo domingo no 178 1 3 6 1 3 the suffer of our peopl is the start point the suffer of our peopl is the start point of a lengthi journei of a transform process of convers of a press appeal for us to serv as salvif mediat for the indigen world the poor among the poor an appeal that await an evangel repli without delai 6 2 sever stage in what we call the diocesan process can be distinguish 6 2 1 the stage of pastor renew the stage of pastor renew began after the second vatican council and wa support by the joint pastor of the uma union of mutual episcop aid in which 25 dioces took part thi stage sought to develop a joint pastor through plan with the aid of religi sociolog and with the encourag of the movement for a better world sever ecclesiast organ in mexico becam enthusiast about the idea and the earnest with which the movement wa set in motion in light of the back that padr lombardo sj and the father of religi sociolog himself canon boulard gave to thi movement mani commun leader who were call upon at the time remain activ to thi dai work in team divid up by homogen zone wa organ in the dioces of san cristob de la casa thi teamwork continu todai with some modif take part with us in thi undertak in the southern pacif coast region were guatemalan bishop from neighbor dioces who were unit in their desir to move forward togeth in the indigen pastor the disastr guatemalan earthquak interrupt the meet that we had been hold with them the process that uma had set in motion wa taken up by the bishop confer itself when it ask the servic team which had been set up to advis the mexican episcop 6 2 2 the stage of pastor reaffirm the stage of reaffirm the valu of indigen cultur in order to develop a pastor gear to the variou situat of these ethnic group began after the gather of indigen mission in mexico and the pastor gather of mission in melgar colombia which wa organ by the mission depart of celam latin american bishop confer in prepar for the medellin meet the share approach and experi that further an understand of missionari work date from my term as presid of the celam mission depart and of the episcop commiss for indian in mexico we thu move gradual from the pro indian pastor run by agent alien to the indian commun to an indigen pastor run by peopl in charg of the commun themselv 6 2 3 the stage of grasp the sociopolit dimens thi stage wa mark by the polit liber of the countri when polit movement could be acknowledg as partisan movement that were abl to run in elect we bishop of the southern pacif coast region provinc of antequera or oaxaca issu a joint pastor document to guid the faith in the region although it wa not our intent the document had a major domest and even intern impact polit parti that had theretofor not been regist or offici recogn went into everi corner of the republ to sign up the affili thei need to regist our region saw a heavi influx of polit movement and parti which made their presenc effect felt despit linguist ethnic and geograph barrier the aforement pastor letter had been both time and prophet and besid be veri us it still offer guidanc in most respect thi stage includ our dioces s inescap commit to join in the indian struggl to recov their land and in the critic of the euphoria surround the oil miracl that brutal indian creat tension and conflict prompt a campaign to discredit us and brought repress of indian leader and the pastor agent who stood by them in their effort and struggl to defend their cultur ident their patrimoni and their surviv 6 2 4 the stage of the econom and social process of neoliber modern neoliber modern with it econom and social process doe not take the divers of peopl into account it seem that modern would like to elimin them as if thei were a hindranc rather than a human resourc on of the urgent respons of the new evangel is to establish the autochthon church which ha emerg from the histor trend in societi cultur religion and the faith our great motiv in thi process is the appeal for love and servic that christ make to us from the suffer peopl with whom he identifi we acknowledg that our path is in our faith in the heart of our church the church that notwithstand it tension and limit and even the human fail of mani of it member is abl to respond to the spirit that guid it through histor crossroad such as the vatican council medellin puebla and santo domingo at no point have we laps into a spiritualist reduction which shun histori or a sociolog reduction that fail to affirm our transcend 6 3 three element that have accompani us on our journei in the begin we saw these three aspect as parallel over time howev our pastor activ brought them togeth until we view them as a basic unit that ha accompani us on our diocesan journei 6 3 1 incarn our church can be truli cathol onli to the extent that it becom whole for all and is abl to proclaim salvat from the veri essenc of mankind in it specif form our cultur it must invigor purifi and enlighten them place the gift that god ha given human in the context of the faith with an ey toward the build of the kingdom that will becom part of histori and seek eagerli to undertak the divin project which ha been plant in the heart of men and which will reach it full in the second come 6 3 2 liber we have discov that redempt through christ is a comprehens redempt accomplish inchoat in histori or with the involv of mankind thi discoveri wa not the result of abstract reflect it wa the result of live togeth with our peopl and see their poverti their suffer and the injustic of which thei ar victim we hear the urgent appeal for us to becom a credibl church that proclaim the good new to the poor 6 3 3 servic to the world we know that the church is not an end in itself nor is it built for itself we know that it ha been sent into the world as it servant and as a humbl but necessari leaven for the construct of the kingdom of god which is justic love and peac we also know that the kingdom begin here although it consumm is not of thi world thi spur us on in the here and now to perform our evangel task of learn how to talk with all those of good will to shed evangel light on the time and to walk with all our brother 6 4 the most import moment of the diocesan process 6 4 1 the indian congress in 1974 the dioces wa invit to take part in an

aristocraci is a tall tale by the press no that is not the case each person react to the world in which he live my dioces like other is made up of poor suffer peopl thi is why i and other bishop ar with them he also reject the adject progress my church is traditionalist progress he explain a boi who wa complet deaf taught me how to drive and us to sai to me look around you first otherwis don t drive off and that is the wai it is when i look around myself at realiti in latin america i see poor peopl that is why i am with them what samuel ruiz see around him in mexico is injustic abus and suffer thi state doe not have a justif in the peopl romero doe that mean that it is illegitim ruiz ye it doe not have credibl romero and what can you sai about pri ruiz i do not sai it i see it it is depend on the govern as i sai in the pastor letter in which i join my voic to that of the peopl peopl ar forc to vote for pri the elector system is taint at it sourc becaus the state control the process to benefit it parti until these practic chang there will be no democraci in mexico romero don samuel i see that some of your argument coincid with the basic argument of the left such as the regim s lack of credibl the lack of democraci especi with those of the prd parti of the democrat revolut ruiz i am with the peopl who ar on foot i am with the gospel besid i do not care what side i am on i do not accept caricatur as a rightist or leftist that is not for us christian but if you choos to see radic in what i am sai then it is the radic of the poor i feel that power must serv otherwis it domin like jesu i am for the poor even if it mean throw myself into an abyss end of answer by now it is close to midnight in a citi that is make the final prepar for welcom the pope onli samuel ruiz seem not to be tire he speak of the letter that he hope to hand person to peter s heir the burn word of the poor in hi dioces the same word of the poor all over mexico he is categor in hi view of mexican polit which ar the peopl s view not mine romero aren t your critic unusu especi now when there is so much support for the govern ruiz the problem is not on person the problem is not the driver it is the car which by now is a wreck romero isn t there room for optim here ruiz both thing exist more repress exploit and kill but also more awar that is alwai the case good and evil coexist at time it seem that evil triumph that it is stronger than good but god s heart is alwai insid just men thi is why there ar irrevers gain in the world as well there is alreadi a veri great awar of the gradual

object is paramount the scientist wa sai at least that s what she had been taught speak to the moral implic of your work and you risk leav the impress that you ar no longer neutral but then there is the notion of a good german she went on thei knew what wa happen but kept silent either out of fear of the consequ of speak out or out of misguid patriot i just didn t want to be a good german the

her profession perspect she ha observ the us public health system from abroad and track pattern of diseas and death among black and white through the prism of american social histori all of which ha brought hale to a chill and controversi hypothesi in the attempt to unravel on of the more troubl puzzl in public health why it is that black babi born in the unit state ar twice as like as white to die by ag 1 the racial gap hale and some other believ cannot entir be trace to racial differ in incom and social class even middl class black women it seem ar twice as like as white to give birth to danger underweight babi instead thei have begun to suspect that long term poverti mai have exact a deep physic toll subtl but signific damag to the reproduct health of black women which thei believ can be pass from on gener to the next precis how that might occur is unclear but hale and other suspect that women whose growth wa stunt in childhood or in the womb as a result of poverti mai suffer intern organ damag that year later can place their own babi at risk that theori still unproven is on of sever that have surfac recent as research have explor the racial differ in infant death a kei reason why the overal us infant death rate is among the worst in the industri world if proven hale believ the idea of an intergener health effect of poverti could serv as a power indict of the treatment of black in the unit state evid that the effect of racism extend beyond psycholog scar to long term physiolog damag other scientist ar cautiou about the theori some believ the racial gap in infant death can be trace entir to social and econom factor if some of the differ appear unaccount for thei sai it is becaus thei have not yet identifi certain subtl social variabl just becaus a white woman and a black woman have colleg degre doe not mean thei have the same socioeconom statu research note a middl class black woman mai have grown up poor and mai get wors health care than her white counterpart the racial dispar seem to impli biolog variat said dr woodi kessel of the nation institut of health but it s not clear to me that it realli isn t a reflect of other thing that ar more difficult to measur other research fear the notion of biolog factor in infant death could be taken as a racist on even if those biolog differ came from social rather than genet root thei fear the idea might seem to impli inferior similarli some worri that the concept could be willfulli misconstru to justifi neglect health and social welfar program if the racial gap in infant death is biolog peopl might argu why invest tax revenu in try to remedi social caus final biolog factor mai be rel insignific it s quit possibl that such factor exist said dr paul wise an assist professor of pediatr at

tradition live no group of poor white except perhap in appalachia experienc compar poverti and social isol hale contend and until the middl of thi centuri most black live in a hand of southern state with littl or no commit to the poor on of the reason we haven t done much about infant mortal i believ is that it is seen as a problem of the poor she said as a societi we have never been abl to decid whether the poor ar also deserv i see it as veri consist in a countri that includ among it found father the puritan on of their fundament belief wa that if god love you you aren t poor and if you re poor you have done someth wrong in the ey of god the theori that hale and other ar explor is just on of sever be offer to help explain the racial dispar in infant death much of the racial gap is clearli traceabl to incom and class black mother have less monei and less school than white incom and educ influenc diet behavior and access to health care which in turn can determin on s risk of have a babi die but some research like hale believ someth els mai be at work for even when thei take incom and class into account thei still find differ in the averag birth weight of black and white infant and in the rate at which thei die for that reason thei ar look for other possibl factor in atlanta research at the us center for diseas control and at sever black colleg ar investig whether subtl differ in the experi of middl class black and white might help account for differ in birth weight and infant death on factor be consid is psycholog stress stress ha been link directli or indirectli to

attitud and expect the new hypothes ar disturb not onli for what thei suggest about long term harm done by discrimin thei also call into question convent wisdom about what it might take to elimin the racial gap in infant death while most research stress unequivoc the import of prenat care thei sai even univers access to care cannot alon close the gap it will take much more for exampl a concert attack on poverti to eras the effect of decad of depriv thei sai the gap between ethnic group is go to be reduc or elimin by address the issu of poverti and how poverti affect child health said dr irvin emanuel a professor of epidemiolog and pediatr at the univers of washington if we want healthi babi we have to have healthi children who grow up to be healthi adult who will have healthi babi we have to take care of our peopl and in my view it will take more than just on gener the racial gap in infant mortal in the unit state is not new it ha exist as long as statist have been kept while the black and white rate declin steadili over much of thi centuri the gap between them persist and even gradual widen as a result a black babi born in 1987 the latest year for which nation statist exist had less chanc of surviv to ag 1 than a white babi born in 1970 well befor the spread of new technolog made it possibl to keep mani prematur babi aliv now some expert fear the black white gap will grow even wider in the 1990s thei cite the spread of illeg drug us among inner citi black women and the disproportion high rate at which black babi ar born infect with the aid viru as hale tell it she becam interest in infant death in the mid 1960s while work in the health care system of labrador canada it wa there that she recogn the infant mortal rate for what it wa a tell measur of a societi s well be return to the unit state in 1967 she move to montgomeri ala and began accumul degre in histori epidemiolog social psycholog and demographi dure the next 10 year she wade into statist an epidemiologist s stock in trade assign to calcul so call standard mortal ratio for an introductori epidemiolog cours hale chose to compar white and black rate of infant death what she found she recal were two radic differ set of number the white number were low the black number were high yet hale found it wa common practic in epidemiolog to blur the differ between the race by report on overal averag rate of infant death it s two differ rate and it s bad scienc to pool them hale said recent so let s just own up to the fact that the infant mortal rate in thi countri among black is slightli better than that of central and south american countri in the earli 1980s some research began to suspect that incom and class might not explain the entir racial gap a discoveri that hale believ wa made possibl in part by the evolut of the epidemiologist s tool for on thing the feder govern began link birth and death certif in case of infant death infant death research could now estim parent socioeconom statu us inform such as educ level record on birth certif at the same time statistician develop a method of analyz data that made it possibl to control for socioeconom factor control for educ and incom research still found that black babi were still more like than white to die in the mid 1980s feder research studi babi born in 1980 found that black at everi educ level were more like to have underweight babi even among colleg educ black women the rate wa twice as high as that of compar white when research then look for factor that might explain that differ the mother s marit statu medic care ag place of resid thei could not fulli explain the differ in the size of black and white colleg women s babi final thei compar the pregnanc of colleg educ black to those of high school educ white accord to carol jr hogu of the cdc divis of reproduct health the black women were 60 more like than the white to have an infant die in seattl meanwhil emanuel who is consid an expert on birth defect wa approach the issu from a differ angl he had been explor the relationship between a woman s statur and her abil to bear a healthi child emanuel found that smaller women ar more like to have underweight babi from studi throughout the world it seem women born underweight were more like to give birth to an underweight child emanuel came to suspect that women whose own growth wa stunt in the womb or in childhood perhap by poor nutrit bad matern health or inadequ care suffer long term damag to their reproduct health that could echo into the next gener if the overal size of a babi is compromis emanuel said then it s not hard to imagin that growth and develop of intern organ becom compromis hale and emanuel began run into each other at scientif meet in the earli 1980s emanuel explain hi find to hale she recal she describ the discoveri as just like a big light come on it just made so much sens to me in 1989 thei publish a paper on the subject fuse hale s histor and emanuel s biolog perspect the question thei pose wa what in the live of american black women is appar so hazard to fetal and infant health the answer li in the mother s childhood and in the environ in which her pregnanc occur thei suggest thei cite numer studi link an infant s birth weight to it mother s birth weight and statur and to her parent social class a reason interpret is that a mother s own childhood famili condit affect her reproduct outcom and the effect is greatest among famili in which few econom resourc have to be share by mani peopl thei wrote that theori and other like it have been receiv with interest and caution dr arthur kohrman professor of pediatr at the univers of chicago and director of la rabida children s hospit believ there is clearli a biolog factor in the racial differ in birth weight and infant death perhap in some women the uteru is unusu sensit to the earli onset of labor he specul perhap for some biolog reason hormon or neurolog thei advanc to full blown labor more easili than other women but scientist have been cautiou about discuss biolog factor kohrman contend i don t want some gui sai well if it s all biolog why ar we put all thi monei into these social and health program he said and in the current polit climat that s not such a far fetch thing more import said wise of harvard is the question of signific while biolog factor ar possibl their role would probabl pale by comparison to social and econom factor he said it seem more like that certain social factor like poverti educ and famili disloc ar echo from on gener into the next i can t tell you what proport of the racial gap is due to poverti what proport is due to medic care what proport to smoke or to gener effect said dr woodi kessel of the nation institut of child health and human develop thei re sort of mix in togeth he said the issu is not to explain the differ but to do someth about the differ in mai 1989 hale and emanuel were marri she took a sabbat and move to seattl to be with him there she work as a visit professor and as a consult to the counti health depart back in birmingham thi fall hale muse about what come next to test the intergener hypothesi hale would like to help set up a studi track the birth weight of black famili over gener to see whether those famili that have been in the middl class the longest inde have the better birth weight it would also be us to studi birth and infant death among appalachian white she said there too on might find addit evid for an intergener effect of poverti on reproduct health if it exist at the same time hale and emanuel have call for research into the biolog mechan by which poverti translat into poor health specif how experi in the womb and in childhood in on gener ar link to health hazard in the next if you
