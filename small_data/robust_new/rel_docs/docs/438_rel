FBIS3-10878: languag spanish articl type bfn straight talk program with host carlo santana ojeda and guest osvaldo rodriguez from weekli juventud rebeld live text santana osvaldo ar there indic of an econom recoveri and if so in which sector ar these indic emerg at thi moment rodriguez well first i want to tell you carlo that straight talk ha alreadi made some predict for thi year 1994 for the begin of the year to be exact on make those predict we said that thi year 1994 wa the year when some symptom of econom recoveri would be emerg thei would be modest symptom as you said but recoveri after all at thi moment we cannot yet talk about econom reactiv i think we can onli talk about symptom of econom reactiv becaus so far some area which have been declin word indistinct of the steelwork industri sime which in 1993 announc that it manag to stop it declin and even manag to pick up somewhat but thi show that compar to 1992 there is a recoveri let us consid tourism tourism is todai the most stabl sector of our economi it is a sector that ha been grow on a yearli basi with net and gross incom i also think that tourism is have a domino effect on the rest of the economi why well becaus the tourism industri demand a number of resourc that the countri itself can suppli todai these resourc ar sought abroad thi forc the cuban economi to divert it merchandis toward tourism i wa also talk about the steelwork industri thi industri ha strong invest dedic exclus to tourism but not onli the steelwork industri agricultur must also seek strong invest and suffici product in order to meet all the need of tourism and in addit to thi there must be other servic such as launder dry clean water suppli system electr line etc all these thing ensur that the gross tourism incom is redistribut among the rest of the economi santana doe thi mean that you see tourism as the sector that is show sign of reactiv rodriguez well tourism in itself is a sector where santana interrupt i am ask thi question osvaldo becaus i would not mention tourism as a sector of reactiv but as a fulli consolid branch rodriguez well both thing it is a branch that is consolid itself but in relat to the nation economi grow tourism is a sign of econom reactiv becaus it is onli a sector which togeth with petroleum ha been expand all these past year includ these recent crisi year i am happi to rememb the case of petroleum becaus i have almost forgotten the effort made by the petroleum worker the fact that our countri extract 100 000 ton of petroleum last year is anoth symptom of the economi s reactiv but thi year the work be carri out with some foreign compani name through the so call risk contract must also begin yield result noth ha been announc so far but thei have been work for a littl more than a year look for petroleum santana suppos we have to make an anlysi of those sector which do you think is most respons for that econom reactiv or at least which do you think is the most import rodriguez well unquestion the sugar industri is the most import of all but the most repres of econom reactiv as i said befor is tourism i have explain the reason for thi and i am now go to explain why the sugar industri is the most import the sugar industri is what ha alwai maintain the cuban economi what ha yield the most import fruit both for the current foreign trade structur and for the previou structur when the socialist bloc wa still in effect when our most import sale to the world market includ to the cema market had been by the sugar industri the sugar industri seen in it broadest sens produc not onli sugar but also alcohol molass other byproduct such as bagass now the medicin the cattl feed and mani other product result from the sugar industri but todai we ar face an energi crisi in addit to the great crisi energi or the lack of petroleum is what ha led us to thi profound crisi cane ha therefor also becom our petroleum i think therefor that we must be care when deal with the sugar industri becaus the futur of cuba must be the sugar industri futur cuba cannot dream of a futur that is not the sugar industri even though we might find a larg petroleum deposit sugar will alwai be the sourc of all the thing i have mention santana ye sugarcan is consid the econom activ that can help us most under the current circumst howev is thi hope justifi rodriguez of cours there is the sugarcan recoveri program we have to keep in mind that our field have been highli exploit which make the soil lose it fertil it is therefor necessari to fertil the land us for sugarcan the lack of fertil first and the lack of herbicid second have result in a signific drop in sugarcan product thi hope is justifi becaus we ar veri serious work in the recoveri program todai the main goal of the basic cooper product unit ubpc is to restor sugarcan product to former level whenev sugarcan product is restor the harvest will of cours regain it rate which had been stabil at the 8 ton mark we have to return to that level of harvest santana you also spoke of the steelwork industri i am still not clear you spoke about thi industri in light of the import of product of equip for other industri rodriguez for other industri paus the steelwork industri is capabl of build mill and also mani other type of equip it is capabl of manufactur pump signific invest ar be made thi industri put out a consider amount of electr and telephon cabl it is also a great provid of spare part it is a tremend produc of steel not onli carbon steel but also stainless steel which is now produc in cuba i believ that the potenti of thi industri which ha taken year to shape thi is not someth done overnight is mark by the special of it worker technician and engin thi allow us to us thi industri to develop the countri and also as a sourc of export santana onc again on tourism i understand that cuban tourism ha perform favor in term of intern market in recent month is thi true what do you know about it rodriguez ye i have read about thi issu i believ it is veri interest that cuba is alreadi be seen extens by tourist in the caribbean basin it is predict that by the end of the centuri the caribbean will be the world s top spot for tourism cuba is not compet with mani caribbean island todai there ar veri small caribbean island perhap slightli larger than the isl of youth that welcom 1 million tourist we ar begin to develop we began tourism late we must rememb that it is difficult to reduc that distanc of cours we must keep the us blockad in mind the greatest number of cruis ship in the caribbean and around cuba transport approxim 8 million tourist ar base in miami these ar american busi the blockad ban all those ship although thei skirt everi cuban coast without touch cuban port thi undoubtedli affect us serious i believ that despit thi tourism is arriv we have mani european particularli german and canadian as heard tourist latin american tourism is also begin to increas i believ that thi will fulfil those predict that cuba will welcom 1 million tourist santana in what measur is thi reactiv the result of the open to certain foreign capit invest on on hand and on the other the result of the increas in our product and qualiti in the econom effort base on effici and control rodriguez i believ it is a combin of all these thing the foreign capit invest ha allow us first of all to access market access technolog and capit thi is the case with tourism we said that tourism is on of the model industri of thi reactiv foreign capit not onli form part of the tourism industri it also plai a role in reactiv other import industri within cuba i believ thi ha plai a role undoubtedli the increas awar of cuban worker better yet the collect of the need to perform more effici work better and even come to believ that the product must be consum immedi and not be produc to be store awai and with poor qualiti becom awar of all these thing ha result in higher effici which todai cannot yet be seen in ani plan becaus the cuban economi ha just complet the process of declin santana how can we guarante the sound of that reactiv be experienc rodriguez first of all we have to consolid the cuban economi on the basi of our nation structur to defend what is our to advoc the best possibl us of our resourc and learn to work with high level of effici econom and us true econom control there is no need to think that a foreign is need to teach thi to us i believ we have foreign here teach us veri interest thing but we can also make our own contribut becaus when you speak with worker thei know quit well what need to be done santana we have discuss macroeconom issu when will the reactiv be felt at home rodriguez first of all in term of nutrit i believ thi is the first thing that the peopl ar expect we speak of symptom and even some comrad have smile and said symptom with the need we have todai i have had to explain that the econom reactiv ha to take place befor the domest part of the economi will feel the reactiv the first problem at home is food i believ we have to solv thi first in what measur can thi be solv well thi is perhap a subject for anoth program secondli we need to satisfi a varieti of primari need becaus thi crisi ha result in the lack of mani thing we could make an endless list of household item we need to provid these ar perhap not vital for tackl tomorrow but ar vital to the life of ani civil individu todai

800 km of maritim border between me and you thi meant that the unit arab emir wa includ then it becam clear that he had a huge nuclear forc and appar wa in need of the oil monei to develop it and becom the third power in the world the invas took place i wa shock and could not believ it i thought that he would stop at the disput area and the issu would be over but he had expansionist ambit and

of on of the bank in al jizah squar said thei did it to reveng those who di in the al ibrahimi mosqu the major of these peopl ar not muslim or anyth els thi is an insult to islam islam ha noth to do with these action thi is proof that thei ar far remov from islam thei ar a gang of crimin who get paid from abroad and have been sentenc sinc the dai of presid al sadat thei get paid from abroad and

start a dialogu with them mubarak we ar not oppos to a dialogu we have spent 11 year in a dialogu with them sinc the death of al sadat the dialogu gave them the opportun to establish themselv but we reject thi when thei start to us weapon our polic ar loath to us weapon against citizen regardless of their crime but thei start to shoot after becom the target of perfidi think of it a policeman

trade center but i wa onli give gener warn befor the incid be care the terrorist group will plai in your countri i would warn then after the attack against the center thei ask if we had prior inform the fact is that we did not have prior inform but our warn were base on our knowledg of those group and their method those who receiv these terrorist these fugit will deepli regret it al qaba mr presid each phenomenon ha it posit as well as it neg side what did egypt lose in it war against terror and what did it gain mubarak the main neg point wa the impact on tourism in luxor and aswan although tourism in luxor is better now but we won over the peopl thei ar against ani terrorist and thei ar activ in arrest them we won the public s solidar and thi is our biggest strength we lost some revenu from tourism but we gain in the fact that the peopl discov that thi terror is remov from islam thei claim thei were work for islam but thei ar onli a group of hire peopl on of them receiv 44 000 pound to assassin the prime minist al qaba where did the monei come from mubarak it doe not come directli from the sourc it move from on place to anoth and final come from afghanistan it is

apart he is a plumber who work and made monei but he wa tempt by 44 000 pound come in on instal without effort he paid 5 000 pound as marriag expens so he spent 41 000 pound altogeth he then put 2 000 pound in hi pocket and distribut the rest among the other he wa arrest the next dai after he bought the car regrett thi is an egyptian who doe not appreci what he is do he get a littl monei but he doe

FBIS4-10668: bfn straight talk program by host osvaldo rodriguez of juventud rebeld and guest eloi concepcion of the weekli newspap trabajador live or record text rodriguez over the past few dai cuba ha onc again experienc difficulti stem mostli from the energi problem we have especi been experienc the effect of new blackout an increas number of blackout thi could perhap creat the fals notion that the economi is regress again that we ar doom to a recess situat i think our listen deserv an explan of our econom situat that our economi is still go through the stage of a downward trend but which can now be consid over there ar sign that the recoveri process can begin at ani moment todai i invit eloi concepcion of the weekli nespap trabajado to discuss thi subject with me eloi take the floor pleas concepcion well you paint on situat i think the visibl face of an econom situat in a given countri is often reflect in those thing that affect us more directli unquestion the energi crisi is the essenti point here and can reflect the countri s situat whether we ar well or not econom becaus of the implic it might have on our technolog develop on our social and econom infrastructur et cetera now independ of some detail concern the blackout you mention we must insist on some idea that can somehow explain the current situat i am on of those who have alwai express and last year when the situat wa veri seriou and spiral especi in 1993 when the econom situat wa veri difficult i express a super optim and todai i want to ratifi thi optim base on some element and fact show that our economi is begin a slight and slow recoveri process as everyon know for instanc sugar is our main sourc of currenc the sugar harvest for a long time will be our main sourc of currenc and the current harvest osvaldo is be carri out under veri difficult circumst we ar all awar that there ar no spare part no rubber belt for tractor and harvest but that the worker have been veri creativ and have made tremend effort to fulfil our harvest goal a sugarcan recoveri plan wa also establish but wa not fulli conclud due to logic problem such as the lack of fertil that ar necessari for increas the product level fertil ar necessari and thei must be paid for in hard currenc we must also have fuel to run the pump to irrig the area equip with irrig system et cetera but i do have an idea that thi year s harvest will be a bit better than last year s thi give us anoth exampl of the resist of our peopl and of the countri under advers situat in the wake of the collaps of the socialist bloc name the ussr and especi becaus of the torricelli law which seek to torment and humili us thi is the first element we must consid rodriguez i think it is also import to consid the viewpoint of the common citizen who ha no access to the macroeconom data and who is not inform about econom issu the economi is improv or worsen to the extent that the situat also improv or worsen in hi hous in hi homelif societi will experi the same with those phenomena we encount on the street call servic transport and commerc the common citizen will consid that those thing ar improv or worsen in accord with the qualiti of those servic for thi reason mani believ that the increas number of blackout is a sign of a deterior economi eloi you also want to talk about sugarcan and the sugar harvest situat well everyon is awar of the materi difficulti we ar experienc becaus last year we had the same problem next year i do not think the situat will be the same but i think there ar other aspect to consid posit within the cuban economi we must mention for instanc the prospect in the sugar industri and without talk about triumphal without sai that we have solv the problem or that we have found the formula to solv thi problem we must first reach a consensu that we ar on a path that will lead us to an improv situat concepcion ye upon conclus of the harvest or even befor conclud the harvest throughout the countri more sugarcan is be plant in clean area and i would sai that in thi special period the effort be made ar yield veri encourag result osvaldo there is anoth element that is likewis import tobacco harvest thi year wa the best in year thi is a point to be consid becaus it will also give us the possibl of obtain currenc at level higher than last year when the harvest wa affect by the storm of the centuri and by other advers weather condit rodriguez we have to clarifi that the profit from thi tobacco which still need to be process will be seen by the end of 1995 or perhap the begin of 1996 due to tobacco s manufactur requir either made into cigar or sold in bulk thi crop s profit will be seen in 1995 or 1996 concepcion ye howev these ar realiti rather than prospect within these prospect we have tourism which as everyon know ha experienc an increas of more than 30 percent in hard currenc earn we can also mention the creation of the basic cooper product unit which ar quickli solv more than onli the food need of 4 or 5 million cuban link to them 1 million direct worker and 3 or 4 million rel we can also mention the issu of the decrimin of dollar as heard which howev creat the well known problem of privileg and inequit situat howev we cannot deni that the decrimin of the dollar ha also been an element that ha help reactiv certain element of the economi there ar also the joint enterpris there ar over 130 of these contract which ar reactiv our economi rodriguez allow me to interrupt i believ you have forgotten certain thing that repres signific develop on is oil extract in cuba last year we attain a record level of 1 1 million ton thi year oil worker began januari with a veri high level which might forecast the break of last year s product record also the price of nickel on the intern market ha improv we have to add that biotechnolog ha been consolid certain product and abov all ha been gain a space in the market recent there have been report about cuban vaccin in certain latin american countri and the welcom thei have receiv in certain countri eloi we alreadi discuss power outag as a symptom some peopl i believ mani peopl see as a new deterior of the nation econom situat i believ we have to discuss thi further concepcion my person opinion is that in the case of power outag there is a lack of inform or there is not enough inform rodriguez i agre concepcion those dry brief note from the electr enterpris regard a situat that affect and hurt the entir popul ar unaccept i believ our peopl ar capabl thei have proven so of undertak the greatest risk and difficulti so long as thei ar for independ the preserv of the fatherland and the accomplish of social i believ the peopl deserv everydai more better and more detail inform as far as i know there ar breakdown at electr plant due to the us of cuban oil our oil is rather heavi and load with sulfur and thi damag the entir nation electr system thi is on factor the other is that mani time the peopl complain that the power is turn off in some region and not in other yet no explan ar given there ar place where the power is maintain becaus there is a hospit or neurolog center which need the power to continu to oper and so their equip is not damag there ar also certain neighborhood where we find thi happen and thi irrit the peopl thi can veri well be solv by an explan of the problem to the peopl i do not believ the electr enterpris should be happi with a stark three line note onc a week sai the outag will occur here and there and there our peopl ar not sheep our peopl ar a revolutionari peopl who have proven themselv for year who ar capabl of resist and endur the worst limit so long as thei save the revolut and the fatherland howev the peopl have to be kept well inform thei need to receiv all the detail and inform so thei ar abl to understand and better resist rodriguez i believ that you have express the irrit of the peopl if he ha been excess it is becaus of that he is express the feel of the cuban peopl i agre with you i have discuss thi with comrad from the electr enterpris on of the excus given is the highli technic detail of the explan i believ that we ought to find a clear wai of explain to the peopl the difficulti at the electr plant which ar not alwai a lack of fuel there is also lack of mainten due to materi difficulti last year the electr plant should have receiv invest or undergon mainten that requir invest of approxim 60 million howev i believ that what wa invest wa minim therefor the problem accumul concepcion we also need to know that the outag ar go to continu to a greater or lesser degre the outag recent increas becaus of a known situat not suffici explain but known difficulti with fuel suppli from russia russia is now sai that the fuel accord might be fulfil we hope so i believ that thi situat will undoubtedli improv in the come month howev we need to clearli understand and i believ the peopl do that outag will continu perhap for four hour perhap five until the cuban economi becom stabil so that we can restructur the entir nation economi includ all technolog resourc which ar high consum of fuel thi will take year rodriguez to thi we must add that what ha been state about colombia s offer to sell oil to cuba is on the basi of world market trade on the basi of liquid payment or simpli a barter by which we sell to colombia and bui oil from colombia howev thi doe not mean that great amount of colombian oil ar go to be receiv nor will it arriv on credit we need to understand that in colombia we ar go to have the advantag of not have middlemen between the cuban govern and colombia s oil compani nowadai when purchas oil on the intern market on need otherwis to resort to middlemen

unidentifi speaker command i suggest that you answer some of their question castro thi is like arriv to take a test without have studi the subject unidentifi speaker professor do not have to studi the subject castro that is so for professor but i have been a student all my life and have alwai felt like a student whenev i have been befor an audienc unidentifi speaker command i am from argentina s tele c new castro interrupt ye but the question from argentina wa left unfinish laughter unidentifi speaker i am alwai on the wai command castro interrupt let me stand i cannot see who is speak applaus unidentifi speaker command i want to ask for the word indistinct of argentina what role do you believ tourism plai for cuba at thi histor junction castro i believ that for everyon word indistinct i hope it will plai a special role and must sai sincer that we ar priorit it while maintain other sector despit everyth bad and good tourism is said to bring i sai as some sai becaus we do not know anyth about it we ar now begin to learn in gener i must stress that i have seen good thing i do not know if tourism is categor as veri good outstand good regular fair or bad i have yet to see the bad tourism categori rather i have seen tourist fall into the outstand and good categori anyth that help the economi todai is enorm import to cuba thi is on of the most influenti sector thi sector ha maintain a growth rate of a littl over 30 percent annual our futur success will depend heavili on our abil to work and particularli on our abil to attain your cooper worldwid i believ we have the potenti i believ we have great tourism potenti and an educ peopl we have a highli develop spirit of hospit as well as the will to do thing right howev i will answer your question specif by sai that tourism occupi on of the topmost place at thi histor junction in the countri s life and financ unidentifi speaker thank you bbc correspond rose hai in english with passag by passag translat into spanish i have been at the varadero convent for a week now there have been mani debat on tourism industri profit it is said that right now it ha probabl reach a phase where tourism profit ar surpass sugar industri profit it ha been predict that the tourism industri will surpass sugar as cuba s main sourc of revenu do you agre castro ye at least that is our hope we hope the tourism industri will overcom the sugar industri i have been ponder thi the larg scale sugar industri and tourism seem to be two difficult thing to reconcil we have almost 11 million peopl and a littl over 110 000 squar kilomet of land i believ we can do both thing right we have hundr of kilomet of beach and thousand of kilomet of coast some of it nestl between the sea and the mountain in other word we have great tourism potenti howev we still have great sugar potenti other industri certainli tend to surpass the sugar industri in modern time for exampl puerto rico produc 1 million ton of sugar about 30 year ago yet doe not produc enough sugar todai to satisfi nation demand mani sugar field were us to grow other crop to meet urban growth demand or to establish industri park abov all the sugar industri is veri difficult and entail extrem hard work the introduct of slaveri in the caribbean wa follow by the develop of the sugar industri in the tropic heat it is such hard work that the nativ popul wa practic unabl to do it thi is what gave rise to the macabr idea of enslav african to make them work in the field here in the tropic becaus thei were better suit to that hard work in sugarcan as well coffe although coffe is not as hard sugarcan wa the hardest crop becaus the harvest and weed had to be done by hand howev the sugarcan harvest demand great effort even if you improv work and live condit also it ha a cyclic natur it doe not guarante year long job for everyon thi result in a larg emigr of the labor forc from the sugar field to other activ slaveri wa allegedli abolish at the turn of the centuri yet ten of thousand of caribbean peopl emigr from jamaica haiti and other caribbean island follow the great boom the sugar industri experienc after the us intervent when hundr of million of dollar which had a greater valu then were invest to develop the sugar industri a new form of slaveri ensu becaus the jamaican and haitian who came to cuba to work in the sugarcan live under similarli harsh condit it is veri hard work i have notic that sugar product declin as tourism develop in the caribbean island the work forc transfer to tourism there ar island of everi size from 400 squar kilomet to 1 000 squar kilomet and everi other size in between i have notic the incompat of these industri boost the tourism industri ha result in a declin of the sugar industri in those countri cuba should be abl to maintain a highli vital sugar industri through mechan and chemic resourc onc we ar again under normal condit and given the avail land area popul machineri herbicid and autom process at sugar mill thi is what we plan to do howev there is a sugar mill nearbi which is about empti of personnel almost everi worker is here in varadero tourism work is not as hard and is more appeal than agricultur and sugarcan yet i believ we have a larg enough popul to maintain both industri howev tourism s potenti keep in mind that we have thousand of kilomet of virgin beach is much higher than the sugar industri s potenti if we fulli develop our tourism potenti undoubtedli apart from other factor the tourism industri will render much higher revenu to cuba than the sugar industri even if thi incompat did not exist between both sector in addit the tourism market is grow much more than the sugar market i have yet to hear anyon sai that sunshin make you fat laughter unfortun peopl ar go around sai that sugar is fatten and all those kind of thing all those calumni against sugar laughter howev tourism is healthi and ha great prestig it seem that tourism is the faster grow industri in the world i have heard mani peopl sai thi unidentifi speaker onc again for argentina regard the us blockad is the clinton administr as sever as previou administr castro i would have to ask you to defin sever unidentifi speaker argentina is well awar of the us posit which is not fair to the cuban peopl thi is why i ask the question you rais thi issu last year when i had the opportun to meet you and the council of state i would like to know your thought on thi todai castro i could sai that clinton maintain the same sever becaus he maintain the blockad the torricelli law everyth howev he doe so in a softer manner and with less threaten and less bellicos word but the sever of us polici toward cuba ha not chang it remain the same rene capril correspond for brazil s eco rio magazin

biodivers biodivers plai an import role worldwid when it come to genet patent on which cuba ha broad experi what ar cuba s prospect in thi regard consid tourism island state and the creation of the caribbean common market in the futur castro the analysi of environment problem wa good at the barbado meet both the environ and sustain develop were discuss we notic in rio that island state ar highli anxiou about thi i notic that mani countri ar highli anxiou about the prospect that global paus chang in weather pattern and the greenhous effect chang in weather pattern mean more drought more intens hurrican and other climat phenomena which ar gener disastr for those small nation while a hurrican in florida damag a veri small portion of the territori a hurrican on st vincent or on ani other small caribbean island such as st lucia or jamaica cover 100 percent of the island s territori and can destroi everyth the rest of the nation can help florida repair the hurrican damag island face territori limit and seriou commun problem a man from santiago de cuba wa complain becaus there ar no direct flight between mexico and santiago de cuba yet there ar no flight between mani carribean island there ar no flight rout sea transport is also veri difficult these countri experi divers difficulti for their develop thei ar affect the most environment speak mani of those island particularli those in the pacif would disappear if the water were to rise four meter it would be a global disast becaus it would affect everi port s infrastructur howev certain countri would disappear altogeth certain countri such as bangladesh with a popul of over 100 million peopl would disappear almost complet despit be on of the most dens popul countri of cours thi explain the high anxieti experienc by these state and why it wa decid at the rio summit to hold an intern confer of small island state there wa an increas awar of the problem in barbado more of an awar than in rio howev the rio summit and the effort of the nongovernment organ were extrem signific in creat an awar of thi problem i dare affirm 90 percent of the govern of the world were not awar of ecolog problem thi wa the first time that dozen of head of state had a chanc to think about these problem and were compel to think about them the repres of the most industri nation also had to speak and explain thing in rio consumerist societi ar the main culprit of the destruct phenomena that ha ravish the environ in past decad thei consum an overwhelm major of energi and fossil fuel and have poison the river lake and sea the most thei have poison the air have creat acid rain and have increas carbon dioxid in the atmospher thei ar creat seriou real problem includ extrem seriou problem with weather pattern chang thi awar is somewhat late certain damag ar alreadi irrevers the amount of fluorocarbon releas have damag the ozon layer and will continu to do so for a long time we must ask ourselv if there is still time to revers thi trend howev sinc we cannot afford to be pessimist the least we can do is fight hard to increas awar so that measur ar adopt as soon as possibl to solv these problem you might rememb from rio that the us govern object and put up the most resist to the accord it wa practic isol i must add that thi is not the case with the current administr thi administr is more concern with environment issu the us vice presid ha a book out on the environ i believ he is quit commit to environment issu the unit state the number on consum of energi and natur resourc is call upon to plai a veri import role here thi is why ani chang in the us govern s posit must seen as posit thi had not taken place yet at the time of the rio summit but wa hint at in the us repres s address in rio and notic again dure the barbado confer we must fight harder and harder and harder if we want to avoid the catastroph of incalcul magnitud toward which we ar head right now thi is an issu that can be discuss at length a great mani variabl enter into plai becaus the develop of variou countri can differ so greatli i point out in barbado that bangladesh s per capita incom is 220 while switzerland s is 34 000 word indistinct 1 billion ton of carbon is consum how much more do the chines peopl need to attain a gross incom 10 time higher india ha similar problem these ar veri complex acut problem how will global resourc be distribut how will develop be apport will we just decid to leav develop nation as thei ar while develop nation continu to develop mankind must exert great effort and revis certain theori i hint at thi in my 15 minut address on the problem of inequit worldwid develop what doe the futur hold for a societi that can onli surviv by grow and can onli grow by deplet the world s natur resourc that question ha no answer thei ar condemn to grow thi is why when on speak of sustain develop no on know what on is talk about we ought to speak of societi that can sustain themselv or that can surviv as thei ar by recycl and reduc level of carbon dioxid and other pollut gase and not by continu to deplet natur resourc neoliber is in vogu todai howev we ar not talk polit here nor do we want to discuss polit yet it is in fashion neoliber is base on the concept of continu growth to prevent a disast howev continu growth will result in a bigger disast we must focu primarili on the growth of those countri further behind the poorest nation we must do a better job distribut the world s natur resourc we must distribut the world s wealth better and more equal otherwis the problem will not be solv yet we cannot discuss thi further here nor turn thi into a confer on extrem complex philosoph issu we risk miss the mark regard tourism faustino castilla director of spain s viaj y tourismo magazin how can capitalist and socialist view coexist in the tourism industri unfortun i rememb what the cuban tourism industri had to endur in the 50s that wa not like tourism todai but wa tourism nevertheless how can both doctrin coexist todai i would also like to present to you an exampl of habanera a typic cuban spanish form of music that symbol cuban spanish uniti applaus castro he ask how can the two view coexist that of tourism and what els within tourism you refer to joint invest right unfortun i do not have karl marx frederick engel or vladimir ilich lenin by my side to help me answer your question yet i believ refer even to the founder of social lenin for exampl at the time of the famou bolshevik revolut had even consid the idea of establish capit under the control of the proletariat lenin s origin idea wa to establish social in that countri which wa on of the most industri backward a countri besieg and blockad lenin final came up with the idea of develop capit in russia not under the control of capitalist but under the control of worker there were other idea among the polit leader of that era the imposs of establish social in onli on countri thi wa discuss extens we must add that among the cpsu found concept wa the idea that the revolut wa go to take place simultan in everi industri nation histori ha still not proven that that wa wrong although i will keep my opinion regard what ha happen in those countri there is no doubt that build social in on singl countri entir surround by industri capitalist countri word indistinct their accomplish were in my opinion truli extraordinari thei will be prais somedai onc thi contemporari period is over thei conceiv with a highli dialect sens and flexibl how to build social we have not relinquish the idea of build social we have not relinquish our goal we ar simpli adapt to our current realiti and acknowledg that under such except circumst follow the collaps of the socialist bloc and the disappear of the ussr our goal cannot be the build of social but the defens of the fatherland the revolut and accomplish of social the develop of ani countri requir capit technolog and market which we do not have at thi time these ar far from ideal condit we ar no longer deal with build social in a singl countri but on a tini island lost somewher in the caribbean lost geograph but not polit tourism provid the first opportun to creat joint associ and to introduc foreign capit in cuba we need all three thing capit technolog and market to develop tourism in cuba we did not hesit on the need to promot it develop we have been talk about tourism which is a veri typic exampl there ar mani other field where the same is happen or could be happen like the oil sector we will never exploit the oil beneath the varadero peninsula we do not want to paus a well had alreadi been drill nearbi but we close it estim have been made on the amount of fuel underground but varadero s tourism develop and oil extract ar incompat develop varadero s tourism will yield much more than the extract of the oil underneath it there ar divers posit indic regard the presenc of oil howev we need seismolog research with advanc technolog well drill and capit invest we do not have the capit or the technolog to exploit these resourc how could we do thi if not by associ with foreign compani and capit it would not be socialist but stupid to turn a blind ey to thi realiti noth would be accomplish if we did that we would be left strand would fail to fulfil the goal of defend the fatherland the revolut and the accomplish of social i have given two exampl as we set off down thi path free of dogma arm with flexibl and keep clearli in mind our goal and the mean to attain them we have been make thi overtur which continu to expand i believ our goal and the mean be us to attain them ar perfectli in keep with on anoth the goal we ar seek ar perfectli in keep with the mean we ar us to achiev them to tell the truth it is veri import that there be trust we have taken great pain to ensur that we have creat trust among those who invest in cuba and ar give investor advantag thei do not get in mani other part of the world so as to make invest here truli attract word indistinct show that those first experi were success we must calcul how much the capit yield in each european countri how much in itali how much in switzerland how much in franc how much must be paid in rent how much doe capit invest in costa brava spain yield how much in the canari island we must find wai to make capit yield more in cuba than it doe in costa brava the canari island or ani other countri all in all it is a competit i believ that we ar in a posit to compet and that cuba ha some advantag as the manag of thi hotel can attest cooper between the popul and the investor is high becaus we have persuad the popul of the need to take these step these measur and to make these invest i want to stress to you that our peopl ar socialist harbor no doubt our peopl cannot return to capit howev thei understand perfectli well all the measur we ar take in thi sphere and that the associ with capitalist compani ar in respons to the realiti of todai s world thu we have grow ti with multin we do thi is a realiti and a power in todai s world no on in todai s world can do without multin becaus their power continu to increas thei have more power even more than govern the power of govern is declin and that of multin increas we ar surround by capitalist in thi world we ar told in geographi class that an island is a piec of land surround by water on all side if someon were to ask us at present to defin social in cuba the answer would be a nobl courag heroic effort surround by capit on all side laughter we cannot ignor capit ani more than we can ignor the sea around us besid and thi wa point out by marx capit ha made signific contribut to mankind s econom develop such as technolog and scientif contribut and a great develop of the product forc we could add other thing that were unknown at marx s time manag capabl word indistinct us of comput in administr and manag we could add mani other contribut capit ha made to mankind also it would be stupid of me not to make us of ani us experi capit can contribut thi is how we see what we ar do without relinquish our principl goal or ideal i believ cuba is not the onli countri do thi the chines peopl ar do it and have been do it much longer than we the vietnames peopl ar do it and have had veri signific success howev histori will have the last word new path ar alwai strewn with obstacl problem and
