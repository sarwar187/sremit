FBIS3-61192: languag russian articl type cso articl by vladimir trofimov doctor of legal scienc under rubric posit the foreign polici legaci of the russian vs suprem soviet the deputi of the feder assembl will have to studi it for a long time text the elect is over and now the new deputi have to decid in which committe of the feder council of the state duma thei intend to work the overal direct of the deputi wish can probabl be predict in the previou parliament sever hundr peopl s choic want to link their fate with the foreign affair committe true fate smile on onli 20 of them we will probabl observ a similar situat now the futur expert on foreign affair will be met howev by an unpleas surpris thei will receiv from the former foreign affair committe of the rf suprem soviet an inherit that can consider damag their polit reput we ar talk in particular about certain treati that were submit to the suprem soviet for ratif but that have not yet pass through it in all instanc the reason for the postpon wa approxim the same doubt had arisen as to whether those treati conform fulli to the countri s nation interest therefor it would probabl be benefici to acquaint the broad public with a certain part of that inherit for exampl the suprem soviet did not have time to ratifi the bilater agreement with ukrain about the reciproc recognit of properti right or a similar multilater agreement with other ci countri the origin of both document wa rs goskomimushchestvo state committe on the administr of state properti the agreement stipul that each of the state recogn certain econom object and rest home on their territori as belong to anoth state also on of the chief criteria is that those object were creat prior to the collaps of the ussr at the expens of the republ budget of the appropri independ state everyth would seem to be all right ukrain russia and the other countri get back their sanitorium and young pioneer camp and at the same time on a just basi exchang certain second rate plant and factori especi sinc at first glanc there ar a lot of our sanitorium in crimea and onli a few ukrainian on on our territori definit doubt howev have arisen in the expert mind the agreement were not accompani by even a tent list of what we will receiv and what we will give back despit two request from the foreign affair committe that list ha not yet been submit but the expert have note the follow situat it is clear that ukrain construct a rather larg number of object outsid the confin of it border from it own budget but russia scarc did so here as a rule everyth wa financ from the union budget thu it is complet possibl that russia will exchang on young pioneer camp for ten plant moreov the agreement empow specif the goskomimushchestvo offici to decid on an individu and final basi whose right and whose properti to recogn the agreement were also not ideal with respect to resolv question of militari properti and also touch indirectli on certain potenti territori claim despit all these doubt on the part of the deputi and expert on of the suprem soviet committe submit the multilater agreement for ratif natur a discuss aros in the auditorium the oppos side began to appeal to yevgenii ambartsumov chairman of the foreign affair committe to give him hi due he displai firm adher to principl and essenti sharpen hi relat with the structur of execut power recommend postpon the ratif and clear up all the vagu area the consider of the question wa reschedul but goskomimushchestvo did not provid ani explan the suprem soviet also did not have suffici time to ratifi the agreement among the ci countri concern through shipment of humanitarian aid the text of that agreement also appear at first glanc to be rather good accord to the agreement if a shipment of humanitarian aid is be made across the countri s territori it should be given the green light at custom and on transport it would seem that it is imposs to act in a more human manner but definit doubt did aris in the deputi mind it turn out that the sender himself decid whether or not the shipment wa a humanitarian on object criteria for exampl quantit on were absent in thi instanc wouldn t the sender be tempt to declar all hi through shipment to be humanitarian aid attempt individu to come to an understand with custom and transport worker onc again the offici s arbitrari a rather confus situat develop with the agreement on the creation of an intern scientif technic center accord to that document a number of lead countri in the west alloc 70 million to construct that center in russia the center transfer those fund to our nuclear expert to develop the most interest project for peac purpos the agreement evok veri sharp discuss in the foreign affair committe and parliamentari hear were held concern it but the matter never got to the point of ratif there were a rather larg number of object here ar a few of them accord to the agreement the center is an intern organ with the particip both of russian specialist and of repres of the western countri but the western have the veto right no monei will be expend without their consent that mean that the center choos certain of our individu nuclear specialist with their project and make the proviso that either the fund ar alloc onli to them or to no on take into consider our impoverish situat there can scarc be ani doubt as to whether it will be possibl to refus for a long period of time but in thi instanc there aris the follow danger it is clear that in a larg collect the role of it variou scientist differ veri much there ar alwai clear head and frequent thei ar not among the manageri staff and those clear head gener an ideolog of investig all you have to do is to pull them out and a collect of mani thousand peopl will not be abl to creat anyth benefici for a long time thereaft the veto right ha obvious creat thi danger there were also object concern the fact that russia ha freed both the center itself and the repres of the western countri from ani respons for ani undesir consequ from their activ on our territori for which inde ratif wa requir meanwhil it is gener known that the compens for the damag incur by an individu in the west reach million of dollar so there is immedi discuss about nuclear technolog and about chelyabinsk 70 and arzama 16 consequ there is no desir in the west to pai in ani real manner even in the presenc of blame for our peopl who have perish or been maim thi is all veri similar to the attitud toward nativ so for the time be these agreement remain unratifi it is curiou to note that a number of diplomat in western countri have organ simpli a pilgrimag to the foreign affair committe propos the discuss of what ar by no mean gener problem of russian foreign polici or for exampl arm reduct or region secur but onli the question of ratifi specif thi agreement of cours the problem of ratifi the start ii in russian snv 2 treati continu to remain open here too there ar sever curiou but littl known detail for exampl unlik us the lead western countri take a somewhat differ approach to the problem of intern secur there littl is said about collect secur but instead wide us is made of variou modif of forc model of maintain intern secur which assum as the basic goal the guarante of an order rest upon a balanc of forc which should not be confus with pariti or equal of forc upon the divis of sphere of influenc and upon the concept of local war as a method of elimin that balanc proceed from that concept thei figur out variou altern for behavior if the region balanc ha been violat or an arm conflict ha arisen then it is stop specif by mean of the restor of the balanc a clear exampl of thi is the conflict in former yugoslavia where the serb obvious ar enjoi the militari advantag if it prove possibl to shift the global balanc of forc to their advantag then the attempt will be made to implement it by demand econom or polit concess and it is import here that in order to make a decis it is first necessari to comput the entir chain of the possibl escal of the conflict if the comput indic that it will be possibl to achiev victori at the kei stage then the politician begin boldli to demand concess if the other side prove to be slow wit or uncompromis then the west in respons frequent proce along the chain build up the conflict thei begin drop bomb on tripoli or baghdad and the peopl there see that thei ar lose quickli yield it is possibl to argu about the detail of thi scheme but on the whole thi is exactli what kind of scheme it is howev if thi is so and the quantiti and qualiti of weapon is necessari not onli to be victori in war but also in polit and in econom then there aris the question of how the start ii treati fit into thi scheme becaus it is clear that in the format of the balanc of forc a particip factor is not onli nuclear weapon but also super accur weapon the latest stealth materi and the qualiti of troop manag it is no secret that the unit state and nato as a whole ar strong specif with regard to these compon and all of them remain outsid the confin of the start ii treati moreov accord to the treati the unit state retain it main strike forc the navi while we reduc our most combat readi mean surfac missil so do we ourselv by violat the balanc of militari forc want to provok the west to an econom polit or territori repartit expert have also express the follow fear as is gener known the sdi in russian soi program prove to be insolv and incap of guarante the secur of the unit state in the event of the launch of thousand of missil by an enemi howev if the start ii treati is implement comput on evm electron comput indic that with the aid of super accur weapon and the us of other similar equip it will be possibl to prevent the launch of onli approxim 200 russian missil but it is alreadi possibl to intercept that number with the aid of sdi is it necessari for us in thi instanc by our own hand to resurrect that program in gener question with respect to that treati have arisen it is natur that the foreign affair committe in thi situat request the mid ministri of foreign affair and minoboroni ministri of defens to send the committe the american and nato concept of the balanc of forc the mainten of intern order and the make of foreign polici decis so that within their context it could decid the fate of the treati in half a year no repli at all have been receiv but unoffici it wa said you have the text of the treati so go studi it of cours most of the necessari american document and conceptu studi were on the bookshelf at the foreign affair committe it wa howev necessari to receiv an offici answer in order later to ask subsequ question it can be assum howev that no repli wa given to the committe not so much becaus there wa a strong desir to protect the treati as becaus there wa no complet understand of exactli what those rather poor deputi want from them in ani case on is led to thi conclus by the militari doctrin that wa recent adopt by the russian secur council there noth wa state serious about the need to us forc model although it is clear that as a result of that mention there would be a rather consider increas in the polit role of arm forc it is also necessari to talk about the unratifi open ski treati the essenc of that treati is in exchang for good monei the western countri have the right approxim onc everi ten dai to fly across russia along ani flight path carri out aerial photo reconnaiss correspondingli we in exchang for payment have the same right with respect to those countri it is understood that these aerial survei ar a mean of carri out a veri detail monitor of the situat in the countri but is it necessari for us to monitor the territori of the unit state in thi wai possibl the specialist ar make a mistak but in the opinion of sever of them it is scarc possibl by thi method to prevent an attack launch by a consider stronger oppon on would also scarc think that it will be possibl to obtain ani substanti econom benefici inform sinc in an industri countri all the basic secret ar locat most probabl in the laboratori and comput but with respect to russia on can speak onli about the econom valu of variou territori natur resourc trend in foreign invest expect harvest plant of narcot and local conflict in gener to put it mildli on can notic a definit asymmetri of interest of cours russia ha not been hide anyth for a long time so on could think a bit about at least earn monei on these flight there is howev no guarante that our militari men will not demand the earn monei to pai for the same kind of flight over the unit state which ar essenti speak complet useless and thei mai even ask for more monei the convent on the destruct of chemic weapon is also on the approach to consider in the vs suprem soviet as is gener known american chemic ammunit is most frequent thin wall and our convers is thick wall which our militari men alwai consid to be a shortcom but with the american the servic life date is shorter becaus of the thin wall our on the other hand can be stockpil for mani addit year

without certain ground were express by repres of bori yeltsin and andrei kozyrev thei point out that thi practic exist onli in a few countri in particular the kndr democrat peopl s republ of korea and that the russian parliament can in the heat of the moment and indiscrimin denounc treati with which in conform with intern law such action cannot be taken thei also point out that foreign partner in the face of a threat of sudden denounc will trust russia less it wa also mention that such step taken by the parliament place it in opposit to the presid there were also argument from the other side it wa mention that from the pure formal point of view there is noth illeg in parliament s have thi right for anoth state it is of no concern which agenc in russia sign or denounc treati so long as it act on behalf of the entir countri what is more substanti howev is not the formal possibl but the actual requir that the parliament ha in it pocket thi right to independ denounc the fact of the matter is that in our countri it ha becom a good tradit when on of the branch of author proceed from certain interest doe not want to observ ani reason rule of the game in practic life in the area of intern

vehicl driver and enlist men an almost diplomat statu factual speak allow them to ship whatev thei want out of the countri etc in gener it is a treati between a white colon and a black aborigin it is clear that even on the basi of pure formal featur that agreement should have been submit for ratif howev that agreement is in effect to thi dai and none of it origin despit all the forc of the rucku that wa rais even thought about stop it action in thi kind of situat what is parliament suppos to do anoth good exampl is the agreement with the unit state concern annex to the requir govern the nonprolifer of missil technolog incident it should be note that the ministri of foreign affair for a rather long period of time oppos the conclud of thi agreement and yield onli under the larg amount of pressur exert by both side parliamentari hear on thi problem indic to put it veri mildli the exist of the follow threat to our interest the destruct of advantag contract with india cryogen engin

order for the freedom station the destruct becaus of the loss of product order of an entir branch of rocket construct thi would make unemploi not the drunkard but sever ten of thousand of skill worker natur in thi situat the suprem soviet enact a decre concern the need to submit thi agreement for ratif the agreement howev went into effect on 1 novemb without ani ratif and of cours no on is plan now to question the opinion of parliament in thi regard in 1990 the ussr and the unit state sign an agreement concern the demarc of sea space in the bere sea in accord with the opinion of expert and on the basi of the result of hear that had alreadi been held in the ussr suprem soviet we gave the american as a result of that agreement no less than 30 000 squar kilomet it would still be possibl to return to the initi situat sinc the agreement ha not yet been ratifi nevertheless by the will of the respons statesmen the agreement ha been appli provision for more than three year the foreign affair committe ha repeatedli propos to the ministri of foreign affair that it submit thi agreement for ratif but it ha invari receiv a polit refus it would seem that we ar wait while the unit state becom perman establish in the disput sector and invest consider amount of monei in it and then the unit state will demand unbeliev compens from us in the mind of the origin of the agreement our parliament should not have ani formal right to rais thi question independ if the execut author doe not ask it to take such action on could give addit exampl the document that parliament ha never seen includ for exampl agreement concern the properti own by our troop in germani in accord with the first of them we were given sever billion dollar but soon anoth on wa conclud in accord with which we ourselv for some reason reject dollar and agre to the zero version it is clear that the recommend appeal to the court etc cannot help the onli thing that will help is the threat that the feder assembl will interact not with the other branch of author but directli with the foreign partner that is will be abl to forc us to take it own will into consider as soon as it becom clear to other state that the signatur at the bottom of a treati wa extort from us and thi is not yet everyth such attempt will end in practic parliament will hardli enjoi the right of independ denounc we ar speak most probabl about a threat by refer to which the ministri of foreign affair will be abl to prevent variou feebl impuls essenti speak in recent time it wa precis thi kind of silent understand that exist between the suprem soviet and the ministri of foreign affair from time to time the former rais a commot concern individu question and the latter threaten a brawl and as a result it prevent action that were not complet thought out it should also be mention that the committe ha not gone halfwai to meet the dynam attempt of the ministri of foreign affair to guarante the enact of legisl act involv the us of our troop abroad in peacekeep oper there wa basic on reason the fact of the matter is that the render of militari assist is a veri expens servic in exchang for which it is possibl to demand a lot and it is that in exchang for that ha not yet observ in our foreign polici action and most of the deputi do not want to destroi our troop aimlessli there ha also been opposit to peacekeep mission and also it would seem for the reason that peacekeep that stand abov the conflict and outsid of russian nation interest is a harm myth that is calcul to appeal onli to the man in the street appar the deputi of the futur foreign affair committe will also encount attempt by the ministri of foreign affair to guarante the take of secret action by the administr for the provid of servic to the diplomat corp which possess automobil servic facil hunt land base and thousand of apart in ani case the former committe agon about thi question for an entir year but did not receiv even a singl posit respons from the

endang by a toxic cloud should the booster rocket explod or catch fire dure launch the pentagon will evalu worst case accid scenario to determin over what area the cloud would land and be sure that that is an unpopul area dyer said we believ that we can safe util these fuel under air forc rule all launch at vandenberg ar conduct when wind ar blow out to sea air forc offici also plot a toxic hazard corridor befor each launch to defin the area that could be expos to fall debri or toxic vapor in a rocket explos base spokesman gari morei said a launch is postpon if the corridor includ popul inland area data provid by the nation aeronaut and space administr show that 5 to 10 of unman civilian and militari launch fail the four major rocket famili titan delta atla centaur and scout have a

scientif and environment group said the us of beryllium fuel on the scale contempl by the militari would be extrem danger given the probabl of a launch failur it s quit like that in the process of deploi space base interceptor you re go to have at least on launch vehicl failur that could result in the releas of signific amount of beryllium said john e pike associ director for space polici of the american feder of scientist given the probabl of a launch failur he said it s an unaccept risk ad jim werner an environment engin for the natur resourc defens council an environment group the benefit of thi program it seem to me ar dubiou at best but the risk ar veri real studi by the militari of the hazard pose by beryllium fuel to peopl locat on and off the base after a launch failur ar
