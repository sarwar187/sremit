to mention here that some habit ar so strong that thei go with on s funer the kashmir game might take the unit state in that direct we think that far ahead becaus a soothsay said 400 year ago that there will be a divin incarn in 1999 that will establish india s domin all over the world india is move toward that moment veri fast just like thi huge countri doe not have even on athlet who could win even on gold medal in the olymp we do not have even on goebbel with a power brain to have the abil to prove truth as lie and lie as truth if we had such a brilliant person born here the indian govern would not have to knock at the door of a privat firm there still is no idea how we will benefit from it it is possibl that thi firm might have contract with pakistan and the so call khalistani

thi articl is caus a major problem we cannot send new peopl to work in the posit vacat by the patriot who ar flee kashmir would not kashmir be replet with patriot brave peopl if we did not have thi

the unit state would not have been so eager to plai the kashmir game and pakistan had to worri about creat a new strategi and set off a new squib to the world if pakistan is eager for a nuclear war

debt for exampl howev we have also encourag thi govern to reach out to dissid group who ar not involv in terror who disavow terror we have had some veri low level contact with peopl who themselv have not been involv in terror we do not support peopl us violent mean anywher in the world we hope that the present algerian govern will be abl to broaden it base and reach out and be abl to work with those who have difficulti but who have commit themselv to a peac solut we ar veri concern about the rise of milit fundament in the islam state seventeen of the 22 islam state in the world as heard have declin incom seventi percent of the muslim in the world todai ar young peopl the potenti for explos is great we have a great stake in promot govern like the moroccan govern for exampl king hassan ha run a veri respons regim and been help in peac in the middl east and in mani other wai we share the concern of word indistinct for the potenti of the situat in algeria get out of hand but what the unit state want to do is to stand up against terror and against the structur of fundament and to stand with the peopl of islam who wish to be full member of the world commun accord to the rule that all civil peopl should follow poivr d arvor let us continu with africa the american were involv in great number in somalia todai the somali ar no longer dy of hunger thei ar well fed further south in rwanda todai hundr of thousand of peopl ar butcher each other ar the american readi to interven clinton no but we ar will to help we have alreadi offer sever million dollar we have discuss with our african friend the prospect of an african forc which we will help to financ and support with equip and transport system we can help and we should help but mani african countri ar interest in provid troop i think thi is the onli thing we can do at the moment we have troop in korea and europ we will perhap have new commit in bosnia if we manag to establish peac we ar try hard to put the un agreement on haiti back on track we want to help in rwanda we ar readi to financ and provid the necessari aid if african countri provid troop i don t think so mani ar need to stop the fight if sever african countri get togeth ockrent and franc mr presid there ha been a lot of talk about the support provid by franc over a long period of time to the rwandan govern whose situat we ar awar of todai could franc mitterrand interrupt franc gave assist to rwanda to the legitim govern of the dai rebel rose up against thi govern and thei had their valid argument thei ar win some victori it seem todai that the rwandan govern whose presid wa assassin ha practic been defeat it wa us the french who organ a dialogu between the belliger and it wa us who manag to broker an agreement which is no longer valid todai we were thank by the rwandan patriot front ockrent what could be done todai mitterrand i would like to sai to mr clinton that i am veri happi to receiv him at the elyse i think that the countri chosen by the unit nation that is ghana seneg and other should be encourag to provid the 5 500 men request we have alreadi said that franc wa readi to provid logist aid and ani necessari support so these african forc repres the oau will be abl to interven clinton if i might make on point about that on of the thing we learn in somalia where we were abl to save hundr of thousand of live and we lost some of our peopl mostli in on unfortun incid wa that even a humanitarian mission will inevit be caught up in the polit of the countri unless peopl ar starv and dy becaus of a natur disast but if there is polit behind it and in thi case it is even more obviou what the polit and militari problem ar i think the unit nation wa absolut right to ask african countri to interven becaus thei ar the on who will be there in the long term and it is their frontier that have to be respect franc and the unit state must support them but i think it is an import test and if we succe then that will be much more import for africa in the long term poivr d arvor sinc we ar talk about the role of the unit nation in an interview on foreign polici two and half year ago befor you were presid you said you were in favor of japan and germani have a perman seat in the un secur council do you still agre with thi principl clinton ye poivr d arvor doesn t thi worri you mr mitterrand mitterrand it doe not worri me that the japanes and the german should join the secur council as perman member i simpli think that thi membership of the highest bodi of the unit nation cannot be reserv for the japanes and german alon becaus there is a whole area of the world the most heavili popul part which is not repres so thi requir a littl more gener negoti but as for the aim of japan and germani there is no reason to refus these countri which ar great power and veri activ on which plai an import role the right to be there with us we will not feel ourselv diminish if instead of be five we ar seven eight nine or 10 but we will have to have slightli differ procedur ockrent what do you think of the idea put forward todai by jacqu delor the presid of the european commiss of have an econom secur council that would help to coordin polici in particular on the financi market we ar see at the moment the difficulti in short term interest rate polici do you think it is a good idea mr mitterrand perhap mr clinton could react straight awai mitterrand i would sai it is an interest idea becaus it is new and it come from a man who ha had a lot of experi and is highli compet jacqu delor i have my reserv becaus we have to be care lest the few richest countri in the world includ franc exercis a sort of control over multin and transform themselv into a sort of global council or els the makeup of thi new bodi would have to be veri carefulli studi so as to maintain a balanc clinton i think thi recommend is the result of the work mr delor ha alreadi done includ problem of growth in europ and job creation and thi is an issu we will tackl when the g 7 meet in napl i think that mani peopl believ that there is a discrep between everydai life and what happen on financi market the latter mai react too much befor there is even an inflat risk thi is someth that must be discuss as for the idea of an econom secur council don t forget that the un secur council aim to solv all the main problem on after the other what would be the jurisdict of such an econom council i think that what mr delor is do is the follow he is ask us to tackl a problem for which no solut ha as yet been suggest but i am not sure i endors thi idea poivr d arvor on an econom level you american have spent a lot of energi and a lot of monei on the fight against commun ar you readi to make the same kind of effort to help the former communist countri recov from their econom slump clinton we ar prepar to invest quit a lot in it we have alreadi cut down on defens quit a lot as much as we can i think i am discuss thi with my congress and i am ask them not to make further cut in the militari budget but to increas aid name to the former soviet union includ russia ukrain and other newli freed countri a signific part of what we must do is to get more invest and more exchang with all these new countri but it is necessari for all western countri to be concern that what replac commun succe now that commun is gone we do not want someth that would be reminisc of the past a market economi must succe and we hope that it will succe ockrent in your speech to the nation assembl earlier you highlight the need to help democraci through their access to the market economi the oecd said todai that our countri our develop countri ar far too rigid and that thi mai be on of the reason for unemploy which is an obsess in franc and the unit state mr presid do you think that our societi ar now readi to make sacrific for more flexibl which mai enabl us to open our market wider to develop countri which in their turn would bui from us do you think that thi is an idea that the french public as well as the us public is readi to listen to mitterrand i would answer you easili if i wa sure that i understood your question properli after all what doe flexibl mean i hear mani peopl sai that flexibl is need what is flexibl if it onli mean ask for cut in wage get rid of the arsen of social law protect worker then it should not be done thi is why i do not think it is wise to want to solv the crisi by make worker and those earn low or medium wage poorer than thei were their situat is not that good to begin with i would like to understand what you mean by flexibl ockrent mr clinton is perhap abl to tell us someth about that clinton first of all let me sai that there is no simpl answer to your question the unit state mai have a more flexibl labor market than most european countri becaus for instanc unemploy benefit is lower and incom supplement is not as high we mai have a more open economi and perhap less unemploy but we pai the price for thi our unemploy rate is quit low but the growth or our wage ha been veri low over the last 20 year and inequ the gap between the poorest and the middl class is get wider thi is not a good thing for a democraci what i hope we can do through g 7 and perhap the oecd paus is to see what all of us can do to solv thi problem and see how we can make the best of employ while respect the right of the middl class it will be necessari for these issu as well as the issu about the environ to be dealt with togeth thi is not onli about invest by our countri and the bui of our product but thi is also about the increas of payment in their countri mitterrand on cannot alwai talk about the econom aspect of thing and omit the social aspect of cours i agre with all the measur that mai make it possibl for the economi to grow but at the same time it is necessari to take social measur i am veri happi to see that we ar current make progress with the unit state of america the discuss that ha taken place which should enabl us in the framework of gatt for instanc to have a social claus and which could alreadi lead to a ban on child labor a ban on prison labor the author the encourag even to organ union so that it is not harass or ban all thi mean progress it is onli a start a timid on at an intern level within gatt but it is alreadi veri good and curious it is the unit state mr bill clinton and the franc of todai that ar at the forefront of thi struggl ockrent unfortun you have not set an exampl mitterrand no we ar current hold talk no you should not sai that not at all i am fight within the european commun which ha becom the european union and i am not the onli on for thi union these 12 countri to adopt social legisl it wa unbear to think that we ar

geoffrei how chancellor of the exchequ as maggi relat in her memoir passag omit last year brittan won the post for foreign econom relat of the european union eu he came into the limelight as the eu chief negoti in the uruguai round of the gatt now the hour ha arriv to run as successor to delor in an interview with expresso brittan conduct hi campaign but doe not proclaim it attempt to overcom resist to the fact that he is british he tri to dispel the imag of a faith thatcherit and to distanc himself from the posit of the major govern for now he succe in be seen as london s most european mind possibl otherwis he would not be defend the role of the commiss the criteria for converg and the singl currenc tiberio so you ar campaign for the presid of the european commiss brittan laugh no i am not campaign the truth is that my name wa mention in the context of the presid and i believ in open and clariti for thi reason for those who would like to know my opinion i am more than pleas to explain them tiberio if you ar not campaign what bring you to portug brittan the uruguai round of the gatt is of enorm import to portug i wa with the portugues prime minist in octob henc befor i had complet the negoti of the uruguai round now i want to inform him of the result there is no mysteri i am awar that peopl will ask me question about the presid and i am prepar to answer them but thi is not an elect campaign tiberio i do not sai it is an elect campaign becaus there ha never been a formal campaign for the presid of the commiss but no on believ that it would be a sacrific for you brittan a sacrific clearli not i mean it is a difficult job but i have been on the commiss for five year first in the post for competit and now that of foreign econom relat of the eu so either we feel bore and tire and i do not feel thi wai or we ar readi for new task that peopl wish us to perform henc it is natur that we explain our point of view tiberio but thi mean compet for a post that in your countri is categor as a civil servant brittan thei mai call it what thei like the fact is that it is necessari to have a commiss that will guarante a fair balanc between the interest of the commun as a whole particularli of the small member state becaus the commiss is the guardian of the right of the small countri and the vanguard of the polici of cohes and excess bureaucraci we have to achiev a balanc between move forward too far and too fast and not move forward at all tiberio then the commiss is an alli of the small countri brittan without the commiss there would be no cohes polici and there would be too mani conflict of interest when i wa respons for competit i had to seek limit to govern subsidi in the richer countri for the benefit of countri like portug it is a tremend mistak to think that an effici commiss is a danger to small countri like portug but at the same time the lesson of maastricht that we must learn is that peopl ar concern about too much bureaucraci we must explain and explain clearli what we ar do as it happen i wa the on on the commiss who suggest the principl of subsid which wa accept and which is now in the treati we must give guarante to peopl for them to accept what we ar do but thi is why we must offer explan tiberio it appear to be a statement of principl or a program and it is precis thi week when you have almost finish your tour of the capit of the twelv onli the pari bonn axi wa left for later that your book europ the europ we need is come out doe what ha alreadi been said constitut your concept of the europ we need brittan well if it were a simpl messag it would not have been necessari to write 320 page my messag is that we must address the problem of maastricht with more clariti more democrat and with more subsid except that at the same time we must go forward with what the twelv have undertaken such as the econom and monetari union emu in which i hope portug will particip and your prime minist is quit interest in thi we have to find a wai to do thi within the framework of chang result from the alter to the exchang rate mechan erm of the european monetari system em but we must also develop a polici that benefit the europ of the citizen a concept that i call stewardship we have to make our industri more competit and i have a program to do thi and we must be open to the outsid world both in foreign polici and commerci term and at the same time be strong enough to protect our interest and we have to have a balanc we will not turn onli toward the north and east but we will have an effect polici in relat to the south tiberio let us return to the emu you have alreadi publicli advoc converg for the emu but without the need to go back to the narrow band of the erm would the criteria for converg be alter brittan no no the criteria must be maintain becaus i feel thei exercis a salutari pressur for econom chang in all the countri of europ and thi will be to the benefit of these countri for exampl portug benefit from the criteria for converg it wa not easi it requir courag on the govern s part but the portugues economi would be wors off without the criteria it is clear howev that these ar not mathemat criteria to be appli in the strictest sens when the time come we will have to look not onli at the grid and the posit on the grid but also at the trajectori in ani event i feel that for the time be the criteria should not be chang thei mai be extrem unpopular but thei ar veri benefici to chang them would be prematur danger and ill advis tiberio even though you ar presum in favor of free exchang you also support a singl currenc brittan ye i have been in favor of a singl currenc for mani year there ar at least two disadvantag to not have a singl currenc the exchang ar costli for privat individu and in intern negoti bilater or multilater compani ar too vulner and depend on the exchang rate tiberio but do you go along with the intransig posit of the unit kingdom and spain in the guerrilla action regard the number of vote necessari for a group of countri to form the so call minor blockad brittan the posit ar not the same i think that we ar make great progress in the negoti for expans to the scandinavian and to austria and now there is a persist problem with the right to vote for which a compromis ha been present i myself on mondai 28 march morn publicli on the bbc urg my countri to accept thi compromis passag omit tiberio you call the gatt agreement the greatest liber ever carri out but on the verg of the formal sign of the accord there ar those such as franc itali canada and greec who ar advoc the introduct of a social claus to restrict child labor and forc labor by prison as chief negoti of the eu ar you in agreement brittan thi will not be includ in the gatt accord but will be discuss onli on the next round of trade negoti everyon accept that it is not an issu of includ the matter in the accord but of put it on the agenda for the futur and the eu will fight for thi two week from now in marrakech tiberio you state that to have left the audiovisu categori out of the gatt accord made the twelv more vulner to retaliatori measur by the unit state do you in fact fear the most notori of the us retaliatori measur the super 301 claus or is it the case that as someon ha alreadi said the super 301 is 20 percent econom and 80 percent polit brittan no i am not afraid of it as a result of the gatt agreement we have limit it possibl effect and mickei kantor the us chief negoti ha person assur me that he accept that the super 301 mai not be appli in ani wai contrari to the present or futur rule of the gatt and sinc the futur rule of the gatt will be quit restrict the american will not be abl to us it against europ in ani danger wai tiberio but thei continu to us it against other gatt signatori as wa the case now with japan brittan well the japanes must look out for themselv but even in relat to japan thei the american ar limit by the new gatt rule tiberio the gatt negoti earn you harsh attack within europ especi from the french mari franc garaud former advis to the french govern for the gatt accus you of behav like a trojan hors and alain jupp french minist of foreign affair went so far as to call you a traitor brittan laughter if you were to ask mr jupp what he think of me i do not think he would speak thi wai ani longer tiberio on 13 decemb portug stress it reserv regard the gatt accord and minist durao barroso state as it stand the accord is unaccept your respons wa i would prefer not to comment brittan by 15 decemb it wa alreadi accept well there is no mysteri portug had a problem and we were abl to solv it an agreement wa reach and portug wa a parti to the unanim vote tiberio precis becaus it wa unaccept on 13 decemb and accept on 15 decemb mani peopl said that portug had sold out it textil sector for 400 million ecu brittan the accus is extrem unjust portug fought hard in defens of it textil industri and incident as a result of portugues pressur we manag to achiev a chang in the uruguai round abov all we succeed in win more concess from the north american becaus i repeatedli insist on portug s need in the second place on the veri last dai in geneva we manag to arriv at a statement affirm that we will not go ahead with the dismantl of the multifib accord if the develop countri do not meet their oblig both regard the rule and regard the open of their market moreov portug brought up the problem in it industri and the union respond veri posit with a new financi instrument to assist the industri in short i think portug fought hard and quit successfulli for the textil industri and the commiss and the council respond veri posit the final result wa a victori for the portugues govern tiberio the eu repres to the gatt ha chang paul tran van tinh wa replac by jean pierr leng who ha been in tokyo until now brittan both men ar highli profession civil servant truli public servant in thi case i think jean pierr leng will do excel work incident we chose him becaus of hi perform in japan and he will be i am certain an effect defend of eu interest in geneva tiberio there wa anoth chang earlier arthur dunkel wa reliev by peter sutherland as director gener of the gatt brittan i would not like to make comparison but dunkel struggl hard for mani year bring the uruguai round to near conclus sutherland provid the final impetu now that we have an accord no more need be said tiberio when clinton chose him mickei kantor wa denigr by trade expert thei accus him of not have a trade background and of be simpli a skill lawyer connect with the film industri in lo angel what is your imag now of your great adversari in the gatt brittan i found him an energet counterpart who fought hard for the interest of the unit state but who wa concern with reach an accord and he wa capabl of make the necessari compromis we fought hard but we achiev an accord tiberio you two have someth in common besid be jurist you ar both of lithuanian descent brittan ye but i don t believ that it wa a great help in both case the lineag is so remot as to be much more a part of famili histori than an import factor in the negoti tiberio curious you share the same root with yehudi menuhin who had extravag prais for your music learn brittan it wa extrem kind of him and i must sai it is alwai more flatter to be prais by someon from the world of art than by a politician passag omit tiberio let us move to the european commiss jacqu delor brittan there is no doubt jacqu delor greatli advanc the develop of europ and he also greatli strengthen the statu of the commiss without a doubt tiberio and potenti successor such as ruud lubber brittan he is prime minist of the netherland and highli success tiberio ye but can he be as success as presid of the commiss brittan thi question is entir up to the chief of state and govern to decid tiberio felip gonzalez brittan it is the same question i am not go to give grade to all the chief of govern but it is obviou that gonzalez is a prime minist who is highli respect in spain tiberio you will end by sai precis the same thing about all the chief of govern brittan not all of them i would not sai the same for exampl about colonel al qadhdhafi laughter obvious it is not the place of a member of the commiss to sai on prime minist is good and anoth on is bad tiberio but
