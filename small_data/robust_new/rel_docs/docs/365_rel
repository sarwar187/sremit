FBIS3-21242: languag english articl type cso text the begin of earth observ the histori of earth observ with satellit began with mankind s first satellit sputnik 1 launch by the former ussr in 1957 follow on from thi the unit state and the former ussr sent up satellit on after anoth amongst these earli satellit explor 6 launch by the unit state in 1959 wa a breakthrough for earth observ it wa the first satellit to photograph the earth from space in the same year the former ussr us a satellit to photograph the dark side of the moon for the first time the next big leap wa to be in 1961 when vostok 1 the first man space ship wa launch by the former ussr cosmonaut yuri gagarin on board thi primit space ship wa the first man in space a tremend step in man s histori score of astronaut have sinc that time had the opportun to realiz the beauti of the earth and the frail thin of the layer of earth s life support atmospher man satellit gave us a new viewpoint of our planet the first earth observ satellit landsat 1 wa launch by the unit state in 1972 thi wa follow by anoth five landsat out of these two landsat 4 and landsat 5 ar still in oper in the latter half of the 1970 s the two superpow were join by a new face japan start earth observ in earnest at thi time japan s earth observ five year after landsat 1 in 1977 japan launch a geostationari meteorolog satellit call himawari 1 thi satellit wa put in oper and run by the meteorolog agenc the follow year in 1978 the earth observ center of the nation space develop agenc wa establish in saitama prefectur north of tokyo initi the center wa set up to receiv and record data from landsat 2 and landsat 3 thi function still continu to the present dai the data were us to make composit photograph of the japanes landmass and sale of photograph to user start the earth observ center continu to expand develop it initi function until it becam the kei organ for earth observ that it is todai meanwhil four satellit in the himawari seri have been launch so far the data from the himawari satellit ar util mainli by the meteorolog agenc for the predict of advers weather condit such as typhoon and heavi rain and snowfal in addit to normal weather forecast the imag taken by himawari appear in tv weather forecast and weather column in newspap tv station also compos the imag and us comput graphic to superimpos cloud movement when typhoon approach and so on such weather inform is now a vital part of everydai life the first marin observ satellit momo 1 wa launch in 1987 ten year after the himawari 1 thi wa follow by momo 1b which wa mount with the same observ equip as that of momo 1 in 1990 the 1b unit ha the same orbit as momo 1 and is set at an angl of 180 degre the purpos of develop the marin observ satellit no 1 wa to establish the basic technolog need to make earth observ satellit thi task includ develop of observ equip to be mount on the momo 1 confirm of the function of the equip and us of the equip to make experiment observ of the earth momo 1 carri three kind of equip to observ the follow distribut of plant situat of land util geolog featur distribut of snow on land disast prevent etc water temperatur on sea surfac condit of ocean current red tide condit of water contamin etc volumeof vapor in atmospher ic floe snow on ground etc in addit momo 1 ha a function to collect data from buoi float on the ocean and a basic experi wa also carri out us thi system after complet it initi schedul two year servic with no malfunct momo 1 is still in oper the satellit momo 1b as a successor to the momo 1 is continu to observ the ocean in particular and the whole earth the most recent in the seri is the earth resourc satellit fuyo 1 which wa launch last year fuyo 1 wa develop in order to evolv observ equip includ a high perform radar to confirm the function of the equip and establish a comprehens system for earth resourc observ fuyo 1 s main purpos is to probe resourc but the satellit also serv to survei nation land and observ the condit of agricultur forestri and fisheri and environment preserv to prevent disast and to keep a watch on coastal water the observ equip on board the momo 1 is capabl of check the undul and inclin of land surfac even under raini condit and at night it is also abl to observ land shape in three dimens and distinguish rock miner etc japan s earth observ technolog is thu shift from an experiment stage to a stage of new develop in which the technolog is wide recogn as effect it will soon becom import for japan to show what she can offer to intern societi futur plan under develop now ar the advanc earth observ satellit adeo and tropic rainfal measur mission trmm adeo is design to succe the marin observ satellit and the earth resourc satellit to continu collect of data in earth observ the develop of adeo is also aim at develop new technolog that will be requir in order to develop futur earth observ satellit a total of eight kind of observ equip of which two will be suppli by the nation space develop agenc and six will be select from among those offer gener will be mount on adeo the function of thi equip is to observ the marin climat the ozon layer etc the follow ar the mission for nasda two observ apparatus frequent acquisit of data on water color and water temperatur of ocean and detect of chlorophyl densiti float materi and dissolv substanc these mission will give data on the volum of substanc produc by marin activ the mechan of the circul of carbon dioxid ga and condit for fish oper observ of land and coastal water and survei of the destruct of tropic forest desertif and water contamin the equip will also be abl to serv in survei of land us and to probe resourc trmm will make observ on global scale climat chang such as the el nino phenomenon and desertif to solv the mysteri of climat chang it is necessari to make comprehens observ of the atmospher ocean and land over a long period of time it is particularli import to observ the circul of water and energi heat for thi reason trmm will observ rainfal and radiat of heat from the ground surfac these observ should be conduct on a global scale but special emphasi will be place on the tropic region becaus two third of the rainfal on the earth occur there the trmm project is be jointli promot by japan and the unit state on thi side nasda of japan is to launch the satellit with an h ii rocket and to develop radar apparatu for rainfal observ while nasa in the unit state is to develop the main bodi of the satellit and the remain observ equip the unit state is also in charg of oper trmm after it launch us a data relai satellit two further satellit adeo ii and high resolut observ satellit hiro ar under develop thei will be launch to succe the abov satellit in oper and continu to collect data and to improv observ function adeo ii will be launch in 1999 mainli to conduct global scale earth observ as a successor to adeo hiro will be util for map draw and disast prevent as it is capabl of gather detail inform it launch is schedul for the year 2000 postscript the technolog for earth observ is thu about to enter a matur stage the import issu from now will be how to make us of it us the given mean the follow ar some of the expect applic i us of satellit for weather forecast and other activ which directli affect peopl daili live ii to serv in nation land develop cover agricultur fisheri urban develop etc and to probe resourc iii to watch for disast and enabl effect countermeasur iv to understand what is happen on the earth and to enrich man s fund of us knowledg v to balanc the develop and preserv of environ to us satellit to find the most effect method to solv earth environment problem by warn the need to curb human activ etc it is import todai to widen the field in which satellit data ar effect us and to expand the data util volum it is necessari to gain a solid recognit of japan s earth observ effort from not onli japanes
