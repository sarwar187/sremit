a conclus about a statu that ha alreadi been extens studi but ha continu to present puzzl question to scholar at thi point anyth is possibl we just don t know what we will find said podani who studi the sculptur befor the museum bought it in 1985 and conduct further examin befor the statu went on displai in 1986 the museum reportedli purchas the piec for more than 6 million from a swiss dealer act on behalf of a privat collector in the new investig curat conserv and scientist will weigh everi scrap of evid on both side of the question and form an opinion base on the weightiest end of the two column he said it wa disappoint to see the kouro come down but beyond that there s real excit in the opportun to get close to a more firm truth we don t have the luxuri to want it to be resolv on wai or the other podani said the 1 100 pound marbl statu that onc stood tall in a distinguish collect ha been struck down at least temporarili by an imit archaic greek torso sinc bui the piec the getti ha learn that it wa probabl made in the earli 1980s in rome and that it wa craft as an intent forgeri it is said to have been unsuccessfulli offer to sever collector befor the getti got wind of it the getti ha also discov that the torso is onli the central fragment of a larger sculptur and probabl a last ditch effort to pass the piec off as the real thing in earlier incarn the torso is known to have had a head but appar that wa lop off when it wa thought to be too obviou a forgeri now that the getti ha gone public with it investig true and podani said that thei wouldn t be surpris if other part of the forgeri were brought to their attent the torso might never have found a respect home if an anonym friend of the museum hadn t seen it and told true about it exist the call came late in april just as she wa leav for athen to give a lectur true said so she quickli made arrang to see the piec in switzerland dure her trip she wasn t allow to photograph the sculptur and light wa poor in the basel port facil where the torso wa store but she wa suffici concern about appar similar to send for podani i felt like someon had kick me when i first saw it i wasn t prepar for it even though the person who told me about it is someon i respect true said most casual viewer would not understand why true wa troubl the torso is roughli two third the scale of the getti s complet figur and the workmanship is compar crude a nasti brown surfac the result of an attempt to artifici ag the piec by boil it in acid contrast sharpli with the glow off white surfac of the kouro what true saw beneath the grime were stylist qualiti similar to those of the kouro these characterist were all the more disturb becaus thei seem to correspond to anomali in the kouro that have subject it to scholarli debat over the year look over the torso shortli after it wa unpack in malibu true point out narrow slope shoulder that differ from other kouro figur both sculptur have insensit carv hand with straight cut separ the finger thei lack a feel of intern structur in the wrist area and the carv appear soft in the upper arm she said while in athen true re examin familiar kouro figur to see if these featur turn up in piec that have long been accept as authent but she observ that the getti figur and the torso seem to have more in common with each other than with the statu in greec after their initi trip to see the torso true and podani return to malibu and present their find to the board of director in mid june thei went back to basel with small plaster cast of part of the kouro that includ stylist detail and evid of tool work thei compar cast of the hand collar bone abdomen and navel groin area and groov between the arm and the chest with similar part of the the torso podani also took a tini sampl of marbl from the torso and found that the two sculptur were made of the same kind of stone possibl from the same quarri on the island of thaso true s inform had indic that the two statu might have been creat in the same studio and possibl from the same block of stone though the antiqu trade is notori subject to implaus rumor true and podani said that no possibl could be overlook in thi case the sampl of stone lent credenc to the theori that the two sculptur were close connect persuad that the museum need to own the torso to conduct a seriou in hous studi podani and true got the

as mani differ as similar between the two piec true said her concern were onli visual reaction that might be disprov or mitig by scientif find perhap the most persuas evid in favor of authent is that test conduct five year ago on the kouro indic that the surfac crust had been creat natur over a long period of time scientist know of no wai to duplic that surfac artifici but even that conclus will be reconsid podani said we don t think a forger could creat that surfac intention but we have to look into the possibl that it wa done accident we have tri a lot of thing but so far noth ha come close he said the getti is just begin to plan it strategi for examin the sculptur podani said among first step he and other scientist will determin the element composit of the torso s marbl includ trace element and measur the size and orient of the grain to do thi he will take tini sampl from both sculptur as in past studi data will be analyz at the getti and at two or more independ lab for the sake

LA102689-0011: book review the unforgiv sin of plagiar stolen word forai into the origin and ravag of plagiar by thoma mallon ticknor field 18 95 283 page back when there were half a dozen democrat vy for the 1988 presidenti nomin sen joseph f biden wa the first to come unstuck the unstick wa accomplish by the revel that a particularli fine campaign speech of hi had plagiar an even finer speech by the leader of britain s labor parti neil kinnock biden who is head of the senat judiciari committe seem to have suffer no long term ill effect he wa even abl to present kinnock some time later with a copi of hi own speech and an invit to the labor leader to feel free to borrow anyth he want but then thoma mallon reflect in stolen word polit is not so seriou and dirti a busi as literatur mallon is a writer who possess grace and wit a delight in incongru and a quick to love hard and grow furiou the grace the wit the incongru spotter and the love were all evid in a book of on s own hi marvel beguil account of literari diari all these qualiti ar present in mallon s book on literari plagiar except that the love is pretti much replac by the furi he thought of call it not a book of on s own but chang hi mind which seem a piti instead he call it stolen word as if to signal that he wa feel angri and not play mallon i expect will never not be play but hi rage is us plagiar is the vacuum that natur abhor it is a quiet chilli excav vice like pick on s nose when nobodi is look it take mallon s fieri even if it sometim seem excess to get us to pai attent on of the characterist of plagiar in fact is that there is a certain tendenc to excus it writer began to complain serious about it or defend themselv against it around the time of shakespear nobodi mind virgil borrow from homer but almost immedi mallon find the denounc denounc as petti mind in two of the three case he studi in detail he us each of these chapter to weav in other exampl along with gener reflect he discov a reluct to confront a fact and a tendenc to minim it like rape he write it is a crime with the odd abil to make other feel guilti there is a detail and absorb studi of a professor at texa tech who repeatedli us other materi and who wa allow quietli to resign even though some of hi colleagu want some more energet action the man involv mallon name him as jaym sokolov eventu publish hi disput version in a somewhat revis version and when complaint of plagiar persist wrote note of apolog in the american histor assn journal and insert errata slip in the remain volum mallon s point is the lack of public denunci by the professor s peer then there wa wild oat by jacob epstein a comic novel about the enthusiasm and predica of an american colleg student which appear in 1980 it wa prais by sever promin writer perhap too snide mallon give the impress that some of the prais wa due to the fact that jacob s parent were influenti editor he doe not deni the author s talent a consider scandal result when the english novelist martin ami wrote an articl cite half a dozen highli distinct passag that were almost ident to passag in hi own well prais the rachel paper publish in 1974 mallon quot them there were 53 such passag in all ami complain the british author seem to have made hi disclosur reluctantli and mallon write that he still rather regret it ami own publish corli smith who on might have thought would have been outrag suggest that the affair had been overplai mallon suppli anger for both of them it is besid the point he write that the two book were differ in spirit and tone and that much of jacob s book wa origin that is like sai that although 50 stolen item ar found in a burglar s hous 2 000 item were not stolen and he add in wick deadpan the book don t feel overal veri much alik it s just that thei ar sometim exactli the same onc or twice i find mallon persnicketi in cite transgress and there is the borderlin case of tristram shandi whose author laurenc stern got a good mani of uncl tobi s sai from richard burton s anatomi of melancholi mallon grant that tristram is an extraordinari origin but he take issu with scholarli indulg and the argument that reader would recogn the burton adag stern he said got a free ride he ha a point but what is the altern could uncl tobi realli be expect to put footnot in hi mouth by and larg though hi distinct ar fair not cite the authorship of a well known phrase is legitim after all on could put an end to literari allus if on fear the footnot polic behind everi punctuat mark self plagiar is gener ok no writer want hi work to have just on temporari or inconspicu life and stylist influenc or osmosi is more than ok joan didion he is sure wa influenc earli on by hemingwai s sentenc he know that he himself wa influenc by didion no on will ever amount to anyth unless hi earli read leak into hi first write plagiar is not mainli or necessarili us plot or situat that other have us it is necessarili and alwai us their word
