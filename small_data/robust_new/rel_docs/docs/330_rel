in the azerbaijani armenian incid and in tajikistan the islam republ of iran show that it doe what it sai in the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia the islam republ of iran ha alwai tri to be a good mediat and to extinguish the flame of the war it ha never tri to exploit the situat in the sens that it ha never pursu it own interest the iraqi case is a clearer exampl thi wa a case of a countri that had fought against us for eight year a countri that had perpetr a seri of crime against our nation and a countri that confront kuwait which had commit so much treason against our peopl dure the iran iraq war but iran accept refuge from both countri with open arm we accept about 1 2 or 1 3 million iraqi and ten of thousand of kuwaiti when all border delin had been upset there were no border and we had a free hand to do what we want but we did not enter iraq i think that the incid and develop that took place around us make all those in the world who ar clever and calcul despit the propaganda that thei dissemin against us realiz the truth i think that in recent year the islam republ of iran ha fulli proven it islam and humanitarian natur to the world i consid the posit of the islam republ of iran in the world to be extrem good all the hue and cry start by the american cannot convinc their friend to sever their relat with iran or to stop help iran thi is import and more import still we see how under such condit when all thi commot is go on against the islam republ of iran europ japan and other have healthi polit and econom relat with the islam republ of iran it is onli natur for them not to want to leav a countri that want to live independ under the current world condit and a third world countri in such a sensit area of the world at that to be in peac but fortun dure the past 14 to 15 year we have shown that we ar complet resist and that we ar veri us to plot and to thwart and confront such plot other too have come to know us veri well of cours i think that thi is the first time in histori that the world is see iran as it is todai befor thi iran wa alwai known as a countri that wa outwardli independ but inwardli under the domin of other and it wa either the british the russian or the american who domin it but the fulli independ face of the islam republ of iran is a face that wa seen after the victori of the islam revolut and it wa the face of uniti in the religi and polit manag of the countri until the victori of the islam revolut and especi dure the pahlavi dynasti these two manag were alwai in confront dure the qajar and safavid dynasti the situat wa differ in other word at some junctur in histori there ha been a close between these two manag but dure the pahlavi dynasti the polit manag wa in total confront with the religi manag the revolut wa the first time that the countri had wit the uniti of these two and thi is extrem import sinc we see that the same person who is the polit head of the countri is also the religi head in other word the issu of the suprem leader is an extrem signific issu that ha been stabil in our countri and that our peopl have wholeheartedli and sincer accept the west think that iranian accept imam khomeyni but that thei do not accept the suprem leader howev thing were later clarifi and the world saw that the iranian accept both imam khomeyni and the suprem leader todai therefor a suprem leader will alwai exist imam khomeyni mai hi soul be sanctifi stood out at on time in histori and we benefit from the light that he shed of cours we will alwai make us of the moral light that the late leader shed on us but hi physic presenc wa onli for a while howev a suprem leader will alwai exist therefor the unit manag in the islam countri ha given the islam world the opportun for the ruler to stand next to the peopl passag omit whether the world want it or not the islam republ of iran rule the heart of the peopl throughout the world thi is not like the alleg world leadership of america which accept onli itself the american alleg leadership but thei ar the onli on who accept thi it ha been prove that thei ar not the leader of the world but that the islam republ of iran is undoubtedli the leader of million throughout the world and it doe not make ani differ if these countri ar near us or not our influenc in countri far from us is bigger than our influenc on our neighbor countri the influenc that we have in algeria over the heart of the peopl in egypt despit their distanc from us and the influenc that we have on muslim in the far east in africa and in the american contin mai be greater than the influenc that we have on muslim in our neighbor countri therefor thi is a moral and genuin influenc thi is in answer to the first part of your question on how we should view the islam republ of iran at thi junctur in histori i think that iran should be regard as a power as an independ countri as a countri where religion and polit and peopl and offici ar in full coordin as a countri that doe not intend to commit aggress as a peac seek countri as a countri that doe not intend to occupi anoth countri as a countri that is fulli faith to it aspir and slogan and as a countri whose word can be trust todai there is no other countri but iran in the world that portrai such a pictur in answer to the second part of your question on how we see the world and the new world order i think that we should expect mani develop in the come year it mai seem that differ stem from the exist of two superpow in the world mai have end and that it is the era of a new order where there will no longer be a threat of war and where peac and justic will reign but thi is not so in other word we have not onli not seen a reduct in region war and clash but we have also seen the occup of on countri by anoth dure thi era of the new order in other word it wa dure the era of the new order that iraq attack devour and annex anoth countri if thi new order did not exist such thing might never have happen we mai not have had the war that we see in europ todai a clear exampl of which is bosnia herzegovina as well as the ethnic war that we have wit it is not as though we can sai that what we see todai is a world of peac of tranquil and of a unipolar system none of these have been fulfil and i think that thei will never be fulfil the incid in the soviet union as publish show the western that thei cannot make a clear judgment of what will happen in that countri in the recent elect there we saw how those who put forth extrem ultranationalist slogan and spoke about the peopl s nation pride got a higher number of vote even though their slogan ar danger the major of the peopl vote in favor of them the elect in the soviet union as publish were not a simpl issu it wa someth that mai have complet shaken the west and made them realiz that thei cannot be veri confid that the issu of a soviet superpow ha end onc and for all i think that new pole ar be form in the world we see that the thought that in the new world order there would be onli on pole where the american would be abl to act as the world leader and do as thei pleas ha not materi i think that in the come year and especi in the begin of the new centuri that you refer to we will wit mani rapid and import develop as to what element will plai a role in these develop i can list technolog as on of the most import element of cours refer can also be made to economi but econom develop mai also be the result of modern technolog the issu of technolog is extrem import in other word technolog develop mai make countri superior to the current power and mai lead to a complet chang in the world situat the world s militari situat mai also chang becaus of technolog develop of cours there ar other import element in the world i think that the most import element that can influenc the futur of the world is economi in it gener sens which also includ technolog and scienc and cultur which includ ideolog and religion other develop such as militari polit and social aspect will all be offshoot of these in todai s world technolog and scientif develop ar extrem rapid and aw inspir the same appli to cultur develop thi veri issu of the reviv of religi thought throughout the world is an extrem import issu the forecast in the world wa that by the end of the current centuri there would be no such thing as religion but todai we see how at the end of thi centuri religi thought ha been reviv and how the situat now cannot be compar even with the situat at the begin of the current centuri we will definit wit the further expans of such develop in the next centuri i think that the basi of the world s futur develop will be economi and cultur and the american will not have the first sai in either of these two field possibl as far as japan germani and so on ar concern we can sai that thei will plai the number on role in the futur economi but as far as cultur is concern we think that islam will be consid an extrem import and great cultur power becaus we ar now wit the dawn of islam the rai of islam will undoubtedli spread in the next few year and at the begin of the new centuri we will wit new cultur develop under the aegi of these rai majl va pazhuhesh your excel s refer to technolog and econom develop call for discuss the fact that energi ha been gradual plai a stronger role in geopolit develop for the past decad how do you assess thi element and how long do you think thi develop will last rowhani energi will plai an extrem import role of cours a special period start in the world after 1973 thi period concentr on wai to replac oil with other energi much work ha been done on thi and now 20 year later with the advanc technolog that man ha at hi dispos we should have wit mani rapid and profound develop but we have not moreov oil is now consid the commod that is the sourc of mani extens develop in the variou field now we even see that aircraft manufactur with composit preced word in english ar stronger than aircraft manufactur with special steel therefor in the futur of industri and economi oil will maintain it special place i think that the situat that the west head by america ha creat for oil todai is not onli treason against the oil export countri but treason against all mankind in other word we ar offer the world s most valuabl commod which is also veri limit at extrem low price we ar burn and destroi thi commod and thi is treason against the futur of mankind it is the american and the rest of the big western power who should be answer to histori for thi treason it is within the context of the signific of energi or of black gold that iran and basic speak the persian gulf find it special role it is becaus of thi role that in the come centuri mani of the countri that ar not oil export will not onli not be export thei will also have to becom import in the come decad it is possibl that there will not be a commod known as north sea oil of cours some opinion ar that the north sea oil reserv will end much sooner possibl in the first year of the next centuri we will reach a situat in which not onli will the persian gulf be the sole export of oil in the world but saudi arabia too will be an oil superpow follow by other countri such as iran iraq kuwait and so on and will be abl to export oil and ga the largest ga resourc ar in thi area perhap the increas presenc of foreign power and their arm in thi region is becaus of the energi issu but we should also be wise in preserv thi valuabl energi resourc the majl and the govern should make plan and not allow thi major asset to be wast we should have correct program at home the majl research center should studi wai that we can econom in energi consumpt as far as the world is concern the energi problem and especi the problem of oil will undoubtedli not lose it import for year to come majl va pazhuhesh the esteem leader s emphasi on relat with america show that the system strongli reject polit relat with america from the point of view of slogan what polit and ideolog logic do you have to offer in justif of thi polici rowhani becaus of it histor ideolog and religi root the issu of america is of special import to our countri first of all when we look at histori we see that from it outset the islam revolut wa a struggl against foreign and specif american coloni in tandem with a struggl against domest coloni passag omit therefor we see that the struggl against america from the veri first year of thi movement wa the pivot and major slogan on the other hand the american too plai a major role in crush the revolut we see how at the peak of the revolut the american gener huyser person came to iran in a bid to crush and to destroi the revolut of cours we knew all these thing at that time and the fact that the shah had plan engin by the american and especi aim at confront the revolut and islam ha becom clearer now in hi famou speech at the feyziyeh school which spark off the 1342 1963 movement and the 5 june 1963 incid hi emin the imam mai hi soul be sanctifi told the shah don t do whatev the american dictat to you at least think and see what thei ar dictat to you therefor we see that thi movement which wa a struggl against america from the veri start led to the victori of the revolut after which the american embassi s plot start thi wa follow by the occup of the nest of espionag and the revel of document for the world to see how from the veri outset the american were work toward defeat the revolut and overthrow the system now too wherev there is a plot against iran against the system of the islam republ against the revolut and against the islam movement in the world be it in algeria egypt or anywher els where an islam movement is seen we see how the american plai the main role in suppress it thu the issu of the peopl s enmiti with america is both a matter of histori and revolut and of slogan and religion the american have alwai oppos islam thought and islam movement thi opposit and confront continu todai too the imam mai hi soul be sanctifi veri clearli specifi the pivot slogan of struggl against america of cours it is true that we did not sever our polit relat with america and that it wa the american who sever their relat with us but the imam state hi satisfact at thi what did we need these relat for in other word even though the american start everyth both the imam and the peopl welcom it throughout thi period the american have not decreas their enmiti even for on dai thei have frozen our asset but what we ow them compar with our frozen asset wa minim therefor the american have resort to variou mean to express their overt hostil toward us and when thei have enter a war against us with such hostil feel what reason is there for us to propound the issu of relat with america in such an atmospher basic it is not correct to propound thi issu at all at thi junctur in histori i think that the esteem leader s remark on 4 novemb thi year the anniversari of the occup of the us embassi were extrem sagaci he clearli state all the reason and logic behind hi view reason why we should not establish relat with america have alwai been list but it wa necessari to clarifi them and to give the reason why our activ should be base on our nation and islam interest what benefit will our approach the unit state or our establish relat with it have it is extrem simplemind to think that our problem exist becaus we have no relat with america and that if we establish relat these problem would be solv undoubtedli in our relat with america we would suffer much harm and it cannot be proven that such relat would reap even on of the benefit that it is said thei would yield especi with america s current foreign polici in the clinton era basic speak america s foreign polici is veri sick becaus of their mani blatant mistak and extrem childish behavior the secretari of state and the nation secur council of america ar in a shaki posit the american do mani ridicul and childish thing and sai that thei want to behav with iran in the same wai that thei behav with the iraqi and that just as thei exert pressur on iraq thei will put pressur on iran sai such thing is extrem childish and thoughtless and show that basic speak american foreign polici is sick and unabl to analyz world issu therefor at a time when america is our enemi and doe not hide it enmiti and at a time when our peopl have alwai been harm and harass by america rapproch with america will definit be to our detriment the american violent treatment of a coupl of our navi offic on board iran ajr the down of the iranair airbu the destruct of the salman oil platform the taba incid and so on all speak of america s violent and pitiless action for us the american enmiti ha been obviou from the taba incid to the down of our plane and to it action todai i think that the american ar pitiless and illog enemi and that rapproch with them will definit be to our detriment moreov basic it is up to the esteem leader to delin and to determin the major and principl polici of the countri and the system and he ha veri explicitli state that we have noth to gain from relat with america and that such relat ar harm to us i should also add that some peopl think that the entir world is friend with america and that the onli countri in the world that is america s enemi is the islam republ of iran or that all countri in the world ar in love with america and that it is onli the islam republ of iran that detest it and with thi type of assess thei ask how can america which is love by everyon be detest by you but i think that thi is not so america ha extrem strong militari econom ideolog and cultur enemi in the world and of cours at the top of the list of america s militari enemi despit everyth that is be said and despit the express of friendship is russia there ar also china and franc from the econom aspect america confront japan and germani and from the ideolog and cultur aspect it is confront the islam republ of iran and revolutionari islam therefor we can sai that the american have mani enemi all the nation in the world ar the enemi of america the third world is america s enemi actual there ar sever superpow that ar confront america the militari superpow in the form of russia china and franc the econom superpow in the form of japan and germani and so on and the cultur superpow in the form of the islam republ therefor it is not as though everyon els except us is america s friend the tone that the other us mai be differ from our thei mai speak in a diplomat manner or hide some of their intent but our posit is clear and explicit majl va pazhuhesh the truth is that the islam republ s foreign polici ha not fluctuat so much after the format of the suprem nation secur council snsc pleas tell us about the process that led to the creation and to the continu exist of thi council what role it plai in variou develop and what it ha been abl to achiev rowhani i think that an institut known as the snsc is among the bless that were bestow on us with the latest direct that were issu by hi emin the imam mai hi soul be sanctifi and which wa creat with the revis of the constitut actual mani countri feel the need for a nation secur council after a period of war or militari conflict dure the war we had a suprem nation defens council but we had to rapidli form anoth council known as the suprem war support council so that it could fill the vacuum that exist with the absenc of a nation secur council after the war the need for a central institut in which politician and militari offici could sit next to each other and adopt or coordin militari and polit decis wa tangibl felt on the other hand it wa necessari for the head of the three power to sit down togeth and to coordin decis in the constitut befor it revis the presid wa the coordin of these three power howev no mechan on how to coordin the three had been envisag in the constitut but in the current constitut thi coordin ha been creat with the emerg of a new institut in the form of the snsc in short we can sai that in the snsc defens or polit decis or in other word militari and state decis on the on hand and the decis by the three power on the other ar coordin and import issu that ar connect with our nation secur be thei polit militari law enforc intellig econom cultur or other issu ar discuss and decid upon in the snsc the head of the three power two repres of the esteem leader and three polit secur minist such as the interior foreign affair and inform minist ar present also the command in chief who is the highest rank militari offici as well as the head of the plan and budget organ who is actual the coordin of the countri s economi ar also present occasion other minist ar invit to particip when the topic to be discuss requir their presenc thi council wa effect in end the differ between iran and iraq at that junctur and in free the prison of war as well as in settl the issu of the part of our border still under iraqi occup the famou letter that were exchang between the iranian presid and saddam husayn were letter that had been discuss by the snsc these letter were extrem effect and import the decis that the snsc adopt dure iraq s war against kuwait were extrem import also the decis that the snsc adopt vi a vi the disintegr of the soviet union were also veri import i should point out that the snsc had foreseen the disintegr of the soviet union at least two year befor it took place and had actual conclud how mani countri the soviet union would be split into and what stanc we should adopt toward it it had even foreseen the plot that the western and especi the american want to hatch in thi region as mani as three year befor and had foreseen that world arrog would on dai provok some in the area to confront iran s territori integr of cours it is necessari to explain that the snsc discuss and deliber becom valuabl when thei ar also endors by the esteem leader in which case thei ar implement as a compulsori decis i think that thi institut ha been veri favor for the islam republ of iran

countri to search for a new altern foothold in case tehran and baghdad might reach an agreement that would mean the fall of their turban and head the sourc sai that damascu offer to plai host to al hakim but he appear hesit to accept the syrian invit at thi particular time after have accept it seven month ago when there had been talk of immin iranian iraqi normal the reason for al hakim s hesit and that of the opposit leader with him wa their secret promis to the us administr to support the arab isra peac agreement the leader of the execut council of the iraqi nation congress ahmad al shalabi convei thi promis via al hakim himself thi wa befor the surpris gaza jericho first agreement al hakim like syria and numer region and intern parti thought the peac negoti would drag on until after the iraqi problem wa solv with the fall of saddam husayn and hi parti and the come of the opposit which had agre in irbil salah al din on an agenda work out by american offici after the gaza jericho agreement howev and the silenc of the shiit iraqi opposit over manifest a public posit al hakim s variabl chang estim in the field chang when the harvest came in peopl close to al hakim said that he fear ask damascu to make public a posit base on on of two option the better of which wa still bitter to him and hi thesi which doe not differ veri much from arafat s and that of the plo to reli on the west particularli the unit state if the syrian track negoti make progress and result in syria s sign a peac accord with israel it will be up to al hakim if he is in damascu to support the accord he doe not want to do that befor hi own plan come to fruition with him hold power instead of saddam husayn but if the negoti on the syrian track stumbl or drag on too long for the unit state

it to him to write down what would in fact be my opinion and thought appar he had the same idea too although i cannot rememb the detail we realli ar like that and so far we have not had ani unresolv differ we sometim conduct negoti mozakereh and discuss mobaheseh but we alwai agre with on anoth i consid him at present to be the most suitabl person for the post of leadership of the countri and he too ha the same kind of trust in me in my present capac i think that some kind of jealousi exist about our friendship and that is why the foreign media sometim react the wai thei do all thi us to happen when he wa not the leader yet let alon now that he is the leader in our constitut the relationship between the presid and the leader is such that disput ar total meaningless the method of work is such that a number of decis and gener polici ar in the hand of the leader and everi on should obei him on the other hand execut affair ar with the presid who receiv the leader s approv and bless

that on of the presidenti candid had receiv a larger number of vote than expect is thi someth to do with the econom difficulti hashemi rafsanjani the extent to which iran s econom problem ar discuss in realiti it is not as such our fact and figur ar so obviou for all that judgment is easi in thi five year plan we had an averag growth of eight percent which is on of the better econom growth rate in the world not mani countri could have such a growth rate in five subsequ year we have fulli reduc the shortcom in our budget we have well strengthen our infrastructur we have pass well through the

industri anim husbandri fisheri etc meet the countri s demand to a larg extent we have reduc greatli our need for foreign currenc with our work on the infrastructur and in the second plan our need for foreign currenc might be approxim half that of the first plan you have seen how thi sort of readjust ha been implement in other countri such as russia and some other and how thi is be implement in iran we do not have a problem such as the on that ha been talk about off cours there ar shortcom in our countri as in mani other countri which is quit natur and is be remov natur the shortcom and the issu which ar the result of a period of readjust might increas or decreas the number of some vote thi is not a veri unnatur matter we have had vote fluctuat in previou gener elect as well the leader of the revolut wa elect for two term at that time the number of vote cast for him in hi second term wa reduc similar as in my second term thi is not an issu that we want to give it a seriou thought you can see that the number of vote in our countri ar much higher than in other countri that hold free elect we won around two third of the vote in our free elect and that is in thi situat of transform from the difficult polici of readjust and reconstruct a presid who carri out the polici of readjust who carri out the process of reconstruct after the war and the earthquak as well as carri

implement thi polici about karabakh we consid azerbaijan to be the aggriev parti and we ar strive to end thi conflict our effort have not succeed thu far but we have not given up in despond we ar prepar to mediat whenev we feel that the war can be termin we believ it will be in both armenia s and azerbaijan s interest as well as in the interest of the karabakh peopl to end thi war and to resolv the disput through polit mean we onc becam veri activ but it becam clear that the ground wa not ripe yet we current plan to prepar the ground to help again about egypt our signific disput with egypt began after camp david we believ the camp david accord led to a divis between the arab and other muslim israel exploit thi issu immens and the muslim and arab lost heavili the palestinian incur massiv loss we sever our ti with egypt for thi reason thei have not abandon the path that thei adopt dure sadat s presid thi is why our relat with egypt ar cool otherwis we regard egypt as a great islam countri and we would like to work with them when circumst permit we hope thei will pai attent to our remark jomhuri e eslami correspond pur eskandar in the name of god the merci the compassion we have heard that in the process of merg the three ministri involv with industri there is talk of sell to the privat sector the steel and other nation industri as well as the organ for promot of industri you have stress dure the cours of thi confer that all these process will take place in accord with the constitut my question howev is whether or not it will be the case that the ministri concern will be weaken as a result of the sale of import industri to the privat sector hashemi rafsanjani of cours thi merger ha been put forward by the majl and not by the govern what the majl ha vote for is the merger of the two ministri of industri and of heavi industri some peopl talk of the merger of the third ministri but we hope that thi doe not take place as far as the sale of the steel and other mother industri ar concern we do not agre with such a move and we have no plan to do such a thing appar the majl will not take thi step either it seem that a propos had been put forward in a certain majl committe pur eskandar passag indistinct hashemi rafsanjani well thi ha mere to do with individu and on should not attribut it to the majl or to the govern pur eskandar but the collect of these individu mai begin a process hashemi rafsanjani interrupt thi will probabl be contrari to the constitut if it prove to be so then the guardian council will reject it thi is suppos that such a move receiv the approv of the majl an approv that i consid to be veri remot the majl of cours is free and independ and the deputi have a free vote if thei vote in favor of such a move and if the guardian council doe not reject the bill then thi will becom a law and will have to be implement howev i do not think that such an outcom is like pur eskandar my second question concern the recent remark by the leader of the revolut when he state that we should not expect ani help from the satan power and should instead implement divin punish hodud even though the satan power accus us of violat human right as the head of the execut power what mean would you deploi to confront the plot of global arrog hashemi rafsanjani sometim the issu ha to do with propaganda in thi case it is clear that thei have more propaganda mean at their dispos than we do we should also convei our idea to the world as much as possibl compar with them we realli have much more to sai about these issu sinc the real violat of human right in it real sens is be carri out everi dai by those who point an accus finger at us the event in bosnia herzegovina todai ar a test case that can reveal their intent altern on can look at the incid in palestin and lebanon dure recent dai the american ar even prevent the un secur council from give a hear to lebanon s complaint why should it be that a govern that ha the right of veto in the secur council choos to prevent the complaint of an independ govern to be put forward it is therefor quit clear that thei ar not honest if the issu ha to do with propaganda then you media peopl should perform your duti howev if we ar talk about what is actual take place in realiti then we claim that the islam republ of iran observ human right more strictli than ani other countri within the framework of islam tenet and our constitut we ar prepar to state and argu thi anywher in the world pur eskandar i thank you for your repli to the peopl and to the reader of jomhuri e eslami hashemi rafsanjani thank you independ correspond charl richard i have two question doe the islam republ of iran share the aim of the marxist ira and seek the creation of a unit ireland the second question is mr arat the isra pilot in iran whether he is in iran or not what is iran prepar to do to help secur hi releas hashemi rafsanjani both issu in our view ar part of the fabric propaganda against the islam republ about the ira we have said befor and have deni that there is a connect between it and the islam republ author it is a matter concern britain and the irish i think due to their weak in protect themselv in britain thei need to sai that their opposit is receiv help from abroad to justifi their weak somehow there wa absolut no truth in it about the isra pilot we think probabl thei have rais the issu as a preemptiv measur becaus the isra ar accus of the kidnap of iranian in lebanon some year ago whenev anybodi ha said thi to us we have told them to bring ani document or evid that state that ani part of thi matter is connect to iran and we would start our investig from that point thei have not given us ani evid yet everydai thei go to a govern that is friendli with us and rais the issu to cover up the issu of the four iranian who were innoc abduct in lebanon and disappear no report ever come here to ask who is respons who should answer here is a pilot who ha gone and bomb a place and hi plane ha crash whatev hi fate and we see that thei ask about him no on ask about our miss person i do not know why the feel of you western ar on side what wa the next question richard do you deni that the isra pilot is in thi countri hashemi rafsanjani certainli he is not here it is a fabric by the isra as i said to cover up the fate of the four iranian you ask the isra about the fate of the four miss iranian abrar correspond khalili mr presid there have been question regard the british issu but thei have not been answer the anti iranian propaganda in the west and particularli in britain with accus of terror ar intend to put the islam republ on the defens here howev we see no seriou attempt by the govern it seem that the new wave of accus is an attempt to prepar the ground for greater pressur at the napl meet to compens for the failur of the tokyo meet britain fail to secur european cooper in pressur iran at that meet hashemi rafsanjani i do not refut your statement that our propaganda is not as strong as their khalili my refer is to govern action i think the govern ha no seriou action here hashemi rafsanjani thei have made accus and our respons is the same when there ar activ measur our reaction will also be activ measur what in your opinion could be an activ measur against such propaganda khalili well london ha recent violat diplomat and convent norm includ the place of a microphon at the embassi of the islam republ of iran in such case the western themselv sometim go as far as sever relat ha the govern thought about thi thi is my question hashemi rafsanjani we do not see the need to take the initi in sever relat relat were sever onc both countri understood that thei have certain cooper thei need us for some thing we need them for other well thing come togeth in mani place sever of relat will not chang anyth in principl we do not particularli benefit from a polici of sever relat except in particular case and for except reason as in the case of egypt i think the exist weak relat must exist for ordinari dialogu we have mani student in britain if we bring them all back it would caus damag if thei want to stai someon ha to look after their affair there ar mani iranian there there ar natur ordinari econom relat and the like we have to see our interest in it total ye of cours we have to reciproc their action in kind your view is that there should be an offens polici instead of a defens on at time khalili a polici of reciproc in kind as you said hashemi rafsanjani there is reciproc in kind at no place have we abandon reciproc in kind even in some place as thei sai in war offens is the best defens that is correct in polit affair too we must go on the offens at time khalili my second question is regard the polici of econom adjust doe the govern have a polici of support the salari class besid maintain some of the subsidi your excel recent said that manag of life for those on a fix incom ha becom somewhat difficult hashemi rafsanjani thi is inde the case i accept that wage should rise accord to price increas we rais wage at on stage thi year thei will natur increas accord to employ law we should plan to compens for the wage howev if there is a backlog we have done so with the worker khalili it ha not been implement for govern employe hashemi rafsanjani it ha been done for worker we have ad the 22 percent inflat to wage i think we should do someth for the employe and we ar prepar thi afp correspond millot in english mr presid i have two question the unit state have becom again the first trade partner of iran how long do you think iran will be abl to delai polit normal of it link millot the second question is foreign minist dr velayati is to go to baghdad soon how do you see the prospect of thi trip and what is the main condit for an improv in relat hashemi rafsanjani regard america where the report said we ar econom partner i have said that we never stop our econom relat with america we have weaken them we won t bui from america if we find good from other place we give prioriti to the non american good america doe the same with us regard polit relat we realli don t trust america to have good intent it oppos our movement and bother us prior to the revolut sinc the revolut it ha alwai been the enemi of the revolut you continu to see the exampl which we can present thei claim to have an interest in talk to resolv the issu but sinc we don t see good intent in america we don t think it wise to start negoti becaus probabl there ar wrong intent in these propos we have told them if you have good intent you should actual prove thi in at least on case for instanc with our claim we said for the past 15 16 year we have had larg amount of monei and valuabl good block in america there ar no condit the monei is in a certain account there america can as a sign of good faith releas our monei thi would be a sign of good faith if thei ar seriou when the issu of hostag in lebanon came up the mediat paus the un gener secretari who wa a mediat told us that if we help with the releas of western hostag in lebanon the us reaction would be to releas your asset well we did we help and the western hostag includ the american in lebanon were freed but we wit that the american fail to carri out the promis of the un gener secretari the most senior figur who had made promis to us is thi not an indic of enmiti thi is suffici reason for us to mistrust them from our point of view the american should first of all actual prove their good intent we ar yet to see thi passag omit the visit by dr velayati to iraq is aim at improv of ti certain provis of the resolut which we have both agre on have not yet been implement we still have problem to do with the issu of pow the exist mine

the intern strife in afghanistan it is said that the unit nation ha a new plan about bring najibollah back to power and toppl the forc current on the scene in that countri what is the posit of the govern of the islam republ of iran toward thi plan and in gener toward the intern strife in afghanistan hashemi rafsanjani these ar rumor i consid it as veri remot that the unit nation should think

incom rank it somewher between the rich and poor countri face with all these can we sai that islam instruct ar the best solut to islam countri problem hashemi rafsanjani when we sai we ar muslim it doe not mean all our problem will be solv we think we can solv our problem within islam s framework but it take time we must solv our problem gradual as you can see in iran todai condit ar better than the neighbor countri that ar not commit to islam we still do not believ that islam ha been fulli implement in iran we must implement it gradual the seri of problem you mention includ the econom

product secur and econom secur that you had in mind hashemi rafsanjani i believ not you see regul doe not mean that we do not set price if you refer to your own archiv you would be abl to find out that dure the first year that we open up to trade we mention at that time that when there is a shortag of good then price control will caus everyth to go underground and will creat hoard such as the black market and multipl price but under the condit when good ar in the market in a normal wai then it is the time for set price even if you go to the countri whose economi ar the most free in the world you still see price control when you go to ani store in ani countri you can see that there ar price tag on their good we do not intend to impos unrealist price on good there ar a seri of good that ar monopoli good we set the price of those monopoli good which ar chiefli control by the govern and we have no problem with them for exampl lump sugar sugar tea steel and so on passag omit we

effect on the low incom strata of societi dure the past few year do you not think that such effect have caus some problem for the success of the regul polici even if we sai for argument s sake that the regul polici is correct hashemi rafsanjani our plan wa to increas wage for the wage earner even somewhat more than inflat those work for themselv will natur set their own tariff accordingli for exampl like the newspap who themselv increas their price or increas charg for their advertis there ar also some who earn no wage and have no incom everi year s budget ha alloc a great deal of monei through the imam s relief committe and other foundat for them we have also help them a great deal that is the polici and the plan is a comprehens on but you mai even know of some case that have not

algeria vote for a group why should their vote be null and void none of those who claim support for democraci ha given an answer to that question those same peopl who support the algerian govern in our view the correct cours is to respect peopl s opinion if thei do not have elect thei should offici sai that it is a dictatorship but those who hold elect well thei should respect the peopl s vote

point that show the movement s polit activ befor the recent session the inact of the nam rais a number of question pertain to the surviv of the movement why did such activ take the form that it took velayati in the name of god the merci the compassion i greet the dear viewer and thank you for prepar thi program i should mention that your view is correct that is dure a period after the collaps of the former soviet union and the so call eastern camp the nam becam confus for a while as you mention some peopl were doubt about the continu of an activ life for the movement passag omit dure the recent cairo session as you mention we saw a reviv of the nam south africa is the most signific african countri with it revolut against apartheid have recent succeed and with a particular credibl throughout the world south africa s membership in the nam and the activ particip of it foreign minist in the cairo session is a good sign of the reviv of the nam the activ particip of the foreign minist of bosnia is the same also variou other activ which we will mention all indic that the movement is activ activ countri of the third world revolutionari countri that have problem with the west and the current system that rule the world all speak about the fact that peopl have regain their optim for the nam correspond numer intern issu were discuss by the movement includ a discuss on the zionist regim would you pleas give some explan on thi velayati the stanc of nam regard the zionist regim is a special stanc which ha been so from the begin it began in 1358 year begin 21 march 1979 when the islam republ of iran join the nam and ha continu up to the present i can tell you the movement s stanc regard the palestin issu ha remain virtual unchang the nam member have alwai laid emphasi on the implement of the un secur council resolut 242 and 338 those resolut do not mean the liber of all of the occupi territori but requir or rather guarante the liber of those territori that were occupi in the 1967 war natur we oppos that think but i can tell you that in the movement we have been almost alon in thi regard from the begin the decis make method in the movement is such that if 90 or more percent of the movement member agre on an issu and sever state oppos it then that issu is adopt and the state oppos it declar their reserv regard palestin in the past whether at the summit session where the honor presid mr hashemi rafsanjani engin musavi former islam republ of iran prime minist and the exalt leader khamen i when he held the presid took part or at the foreign minist gather the nam stanc concern palestin ha alwai been differ from that of the islam republ of iran therefor thei us to make a decis and we would declar our reserv not even onc did thei adopt a posit that would coincid with the posit we sought neither there nor at the islam confer organ session nor at the un correspond you refer to bosnia what action and what coordin wa undertaken in thi regard velayati it wa the first time that the nam unanim adopt a resolut prepar by the iri and malaysia it wa first propos by malaysia after consult with us the session decid that the iri and malaysia should consult with each other and prepar a text that is what we did and present to the movement and latter adopt it that is the first time that a decis stanc ha been taken in favor of bosnia and against the serb take into account the fact that the serb consid themselv the inheritor of the former yugoslavia yugoslavia wa on of the founder of nam and some of the older member of the movement had reserv regard a condemn of serbia and montenegro or as thei call it yugoslavia minor but in the resolut the stanc of the nam movement wa almost the same as that of the iri and that wa a posit develop correspond the final statement of the nam foreign minist session also consid issu such as disarma human right and the environ would you make a statement on that velayati i must sai that the issu you refer to that is disarma human right and the environ ar sever import issu at world level especi in recent year and the unit nation conven independ session in connect with those import intern issu or attach to other or other subject as heard if the state do not coordin with each other third world state or develop state the wish of the western state or the perman member state of the secur council will be impos on them among the iri polici whether in the islam confer organ ico or in nam on is to coordin these import intern issu in those two organ so that it can have the support of other state for those issu at commiss committe and forum where thei ar rais in the ico we pioneer the human right plan when it held a session in pakistan and follow that the foreign ministri deputi for intern affair becam the head of the asia oceania human right committe and the latter made decis despit the presenc of some state that support the west and that committe show a great deal of effici especi in the vienna session in the vienna session the situat wa such that mr carter the former us presid wa boo by those non government organ which had gather there for human right and thei fail to realiz their point of view which thei intend to impos becaus of the resist of iran and sever other state thi time round we propag that move into the nam movement and what wa adopt there wa almost what we had propos in the specif committe and that wa a veri good victori that mean that in intern forum those place where human right ar rais 109 member state of the nam movement have virtual the same stanc and the crucial point which is common for all of us that common view ha been achiev gradual some mai have been perhap under western pressur against human right in variou countri be defin accord to the tradit valu and belief of those countri and commun rather than be form on the basi of western belief which ar mainli secular belief and ar impos on the rest of the world that wa good progress regard human right and wa adopt there regard disarma the view of the movement is summar in thi sentenc which is the same as our view we ar for disarma but against discrimin it is not right that in the middl east or variou area countri should be prohibit from possess arm which ar effect for their defens while the arsen of some countri which ar the appl of their ey so to speak ar brim with nuclear chemic and convent arm that is not right we ar definit against weapon of mass destruct but we ask why there should be discrimin in favor of some israel is a case in point it is said that israel ha 800 nuclear weapon in it arsen that is the view of the nam movement which coincid with our point of view i wa the person who first moot that issu in the movement in my speech the rest follow suit and eventu it wa adopt in a proper form correspond also the issu of restructur the system of intern relat and the un system wa discuss which countri rais the issu and in principl what doe it entail velayati essenti the restructur of the unit nation is be rais in all state the intern arena and the un itself recent the us presid in hi visit to europ said that thei support japan and germani s perman membership in the secur council that in itself is in realiti a disclosur about a part of a plan to restructur the unit nation then that issu in it gener form is be rais in the whole of the intern arena and all the state and all have come to believ that after the pass of about 50 year sinc the format of the unit nation a restructur must be carri out but debat differ as to how that restructur should be as develop countri and member of the nam movement we believ that a special place must be alloc to us in the unit nation so that these state can put forward as well as implement their point of view there correspond i have anoth question to ask your excel and that concern the venu of the nam foreign ministeri session why did the nam choos egypt as the venu for it 11th session velayati the choic of the countri is base on a propos made by a countri that wish to host the session follow by the approv of the nam member countri it doe not work like thi that the nam decid to transfer the venu of the session to a certain countri usual a countri offer and the offer is discuss and approv by the nam egypt wa also on of those countri perhap it wa the onli countri that nearli the major of the nam member agre upon as the locat for the session correspond what wa the reason for the iranian deleg attend the recent session bear in mind that some peopl believ that perhap the issu of iran s relat with egypt wa also on the agenda velayati i should mention that attend intern session that ar held at a certain countri doe not necessarili mean endors that countri or it doe not mean that effort ar underwai to establish relat with that countri that is if no relat exist thi is the intern norm todai so mani intern session take place in variou part of the world that thi matter doe not appli ani more if a countri take part in a session somewher we cannot blame it for someth that doe not exist unless of cours other signal have been given we ar member of more than 400 intern organ everi dai the offici from the islam republ take part in meet in on or sever place in the world thi wa not the first time that we took part in an intern organ in cairo the best exampl that support thi polici and show that thi polici exist in the past in the islam republ whether at the time of the imam mai he be admit to god s paradis or whether at the time of the esteem leader khamen i that we take part in intern organ wherev thei ar held with the except of israel the best exampl for thi is america we go to new york to take part in the unit nation even more glare than that our econom and bank offici go to washington to take part in the meet of the world bank and the intern monetari fund our presenc in washington to take part in the world bank doe not necessarili mean that we wish to establish relat with america addition do the offici of the ministri of foreign affair not know that such sensit polit decis would especi requir the complet confirm of the system what polici do we wish to advanc by do thi or what ar we try to prevent so certainli there ha been no such intent these were some preliminari point in our discuss howev on whether we should or should not take part in the nonalign movement meet even if it is in egypt we certainli should take part todai everybodi admit that we ar on of the five or six most activ member of the nonalign movement our presenc in the nonalign movement is veri decis i have enumer some of the decis that were adopt there as the result of the effort of the islam republ and there ar more case in our absenc other will definit not adopt polici that ar in our interest whether we ar present or not the nonalign movement will hold it session there thei will reach their decis in our absenc but without take our view into consider how would it be possibl that we wast the result of our effort over mani year in the nonalign movement through nonparticip in these meet i should sai that we cannot be absent from these meet at the foreign minist level which ar held everi three year and which perform a veri basic role there have been these reason therefor the holi system of the islam republ of iran decid to take part in the nonalign movement at the level of foreign minist and we were author to take part of cours our own consult view wa also in support of thi decis but the final decis on these sensit issu regard foreign polici do not rest with the ministri of foreign affair there ar hardli ani other area in the decis make process of the islam republ of iran that so much attent is paid to the decis that ar adopt the sourc that adopt the basic line of the foreign polici of iran is definit the highest decis make sourc which ultim is approv by the esteem leader announc tri to interrupt but velayati continu therefor it wa the decis of the system that we should take part in the movement it is also the decis of the system that we should even have intern cooper with egypt thi decis had also been adopt in the past and it wa reaffirm and restat on the ev of the last session of the nonalign movement our presenc in egypt did not in ani wai mean the establish of diplomat relat we had no such intent our govern is sincer with it peopl and it inform the peopl about what it decid the decis of our govern of the system of the islam republ of iran wa not to establish relat with egypt by go there as hi excel the presid said in hi remark a few dai ago the decis wa that we should take part in the meet of the nonalign movement let me add thi and thi ha not been said befor that we have been both allow and inde task to work with egypt in the field of intern activ correspond on of the issu mention in the final communiqu wa the issu of iraq in the near futur you will be visit iraq will the decis taken by the nam be discuss dure thi visit or not velayati i should sai that it is not definit that my visit will take place in the near futur but it is highli probabl that it will be in the near futur the main aim behind the visit to iraq is to remov some of the difficulti which exist in our relat some of the paragraph of un resolut 598 have not yet been implement or have not been implement fulli we must continu our talk with iraq so that the paragraph which have either not been implement or which have been partli implement will be implement or will be fulli implement at the same time these visit and talk will definit result in improv relat between iran and iraq on of the area where we can cooper with iraq is definit on the intern stage and on the stage of the nam at the moment iraq s stanc regard the issu of palestin is close to the stanc of the islam republ base on what i heard and wit from their foreign minist in the recent session of the nam correspond there ar mani other question on lebanon on yemen and on the next nam summit meet and it venu but as time is short i will leav them for now if you wish to briefli sai someth in the form of sum up pleas do so velayati i should sai that todai the nation interest of the countri can be threaten from outsid their border much more than befor therefor it is the duti of govern includ our duti as those serv the holi order of the islam republ to reduc diminish or elimin these threat as much as we can through our effort todai the intern scene is the most import arena for reach decis for or against variou countri what is happen to iraq todai what ha happen to libya the pressur which is be exert over north korea what took place in bosnia what happen in somalia the decis on all of those were taken almost entir on the intern arena if thei wish to exert pressur on the islam republ of iran todai it is veri unlik that thi can be done on a bilater basi what will be done will be on the intern scene our peopl quit rightli expect the ministri of foreign affair to be present on the intern stage and to defend the right of the islam republ of iran if we sit in the islam republ and through variou excus refus to attend variou intern organ at time some of these excus which ar recommend to us by certain circl ar also veri childish and if we ar content with mere issu statement paus if our ministri of foreign affair doe not take part in for instanc the nonalign meet or the un session or the ico session each of them due to a differ reason the ico becaus it wa held in jeddah the nonalign meet becaus it wa held in cairo or such and such a un confer ha been held in some part of europ if we sai that due to thi we will not attend them if instead of go there make an effort accept some risk and fight against conspiraci we sit here and onli issu veri strongli word statement such statement will definit have no credibl on the intern stage definit our peopl would not be happi with that the peopl wish the ministri of foreign affair to be activ thei would like the ministri of foreign affair to find a wai through the maze of the complex problem and difficulti and through all the interrel and complic difficulti and obstacl which exist in the present world and which ar special impos on us by our enemi thei would like us to find a wai out of thi maze and to resolv the problem of cours it is much more difficult for us to be present in intern organ and to make effort to take on step in the interest of the islam republ rather than sit insid the ministri of foreign affair and issu statement issu statement and adopt harsh posit will not be veri difficult for us or for the employe of the ministri of foreign affair what is hard is to be present in intern arena it is to go to the center of danger we will certainli take risk to advanc our foreign polici see right now the deputi minist of foreign affair is in afghanistan at the moment there is no other ambassador in kabul except the ambassador of the islam republ our embassi ha been raze to the ground and our ambassador is live in a shelter at the height of the crisi in beirut our ambassador or charg d affair wa there the third embassi which wa open in sarajevo wa the embassi of the islam republ of iran to go to those place is to face danger nevertheless we will accept these danger with open arm if we can unti a knot from the problem of the peopl correspond mr

revolutionari guard depend on how mani ar particip through the baseej our late imam khomeini said we had to provid militari train for everybodi everi moslem should be readi to defend hi countri becaus of thi we can maintain a rel low number of expert in the armi these ar men who can oper state of the art veri sophist equip but when it is time to defend the revolut each and everi person would take up arm it is a religi duti which fall upon everyon on reduc the size of the armi to maintain a great armi in term of number you must have a veri prosper economi we ar in the middl of reconstruct our countri so we have to find a wai of remain strong while limit spend the solut to that is the baseej as a result the number of peopl with full time armi career can be cut but we will retain personnel with high technic abil the futur for conscript it ha to undergo certain chang we began the process three year ago those peopl who will be draft thi year were born in 1971 in that year 1 3m peopl were born in iran from that number there ar 600 000 young men avail to be draft if we were to take thi number of peopl into the armi it would mean that over two year we would have to cope with 1 2m men the capac of our base and garrison is not suffici neither do we have the monei to feed those peopl therefor a larg number ar set asid for other servic for exampl we have a servic call gi teacher there is anoth link to health care and a third involv with literaci soldier who have a diploma of educ would be set asid for teach other go to help with the reconstruct work in villag all have to undergo 45 dai of militari school befor be sent off militari expenditur i would veri much like the dollar 2bn a year talk about in the west but i do not get that thi year we have dollar 750m in actual dollar and rather less than the equival of dollar 1bn in rial we would like to receiv more the build up of arm in the region in the past three or four year most conflict in the world have come to an end the great war have conclud such as in cambodia and between iran and iraq but countri which produc armament need a market for them some of the countri around the persian gulf ar veri rich so the arm produc have to think of wai to get those petrodollar accordingli thei produc some phantom threat to try to scare those countri thei forc them to sign veri big arm deal thi doe not make us feel threaten around us we do not see ani countri which would be a threat we have the best of relat with pakistan afghanistan is a poor countri which for the next 20 year will have to spend whatev monei it ha on reconstruct we have veri good relat with turkei and equal the turk do not feel we ar a threat to them iraq is a countri which is try to avoid be dismemb the countri to the south of us ar veri small and weak and need us to help defend them so no on is threaten us our prioriti is to rebuild the countri us forc in the gulf the american would not attack us militarili peopl live in glass hous do not throw stone the us doe not have ani reason to attack us thei come to the region to get as much arab monei as thei can and even if the american did want to attack us thei would not do so in a classic militari movement can our air forc for exampl take on the american or our navi take on the american navi if we put all of our countri s budget into such a war we would have just burn our monei the wai to go about deal with such a threat requir a differ solut entir iraq the no fly zone and us intent even if iraq is cut into three part it doe not necessarili threaten our interest of cours we ar veri much against the disintegr of iraq but i do not subscrib to the view that the american ar look for troubl and want to attack us right now the american have mani problem throughout the world and have to deal with them first with mr clinton take power i think that america will scale back it adventur abroad and will start work on it own countri clinton for instanc ha announc that he is reduc the number of navi fleet from 12 to 10 and the number of us troop with the nato forc will be reduc to 75 000 the us budget for militari purpos is dollar 250bn it economi at the moment cannot sustain such a budget the american have to deal with these problem first it is not logic for a countri which is reduc it militari base around the world and want to reduc it militari budget to attack us at the same time we do not want to enter a war with the american either iran s militari shop list the first prioriti is spare part the second prioriti is spare part and the third prioriti is spare part our equip is mostli american f 4 f 5 f 14 fighter jet our transport aircraft ar also american c 130s boe 707s and 747s we have a veri good fleet 14 707s 12 747s and 53 c 130s thi should be enough to see us through the next 20 year the onli problem for us is to provid spare part in order to keep them fly for exampl we have 72 f 14s thi is the best air superior that monei can bui in the next 20 year noth will be it competitor therefor we should onli be think about bui spare part to maintain our present fleet for closer support we have f 5 fighter and for deep strike f 4 fighter thi is a veri good configur we still have 750 helicopt i person think that we still have the third largest fleet in the world unfortun becaus our fleet is mainli made up of american product provid spare is veri difficult of cours we also have some soviet made armament but veri few cheap soviet equip we have bought some tank from the russian but the dai of tank warfar ar number iraq in it conflict with the us show that tank ar not much us ani more sinc the advent of attack helicopt tank ar becom useless but anywai we have bought a number we have also bought f 7 fighter from china which compar to the mig 21 the main reason for bui those chines fighter is to fulfil the number of flight hour that our pilot must have missil purchas scud b missil cost dollar 2 5m each so it is a veri larg invest and the outcom of ani war would not be decid by such weapon but our technolog capabl is such that if we requir similar missil then we can manufactur them ourselv submarin and their impact on the strateg balanc the price tag mention in the western media recent of dollar 250m for a submarin is not correct befor the revolut a german compani sold us six submarin the american sold us two but thei did not deliv we have bought our russian submarin at a substanti lower price than wa mention all we ar do is to fill the gap in our militari plan a complet system is made up of differ compon most of the other compon had been bought befor the revolut submarin were the on compon that wa miss and we ar now bui them the develop of militari industri onli a veri few countri such as america russia china and franc can produc all their requir the rest produc onli a fraction it might be possibl for us to build tank submarin missil aircraft and such like but self suffici is rel we think of self suffici in term of those item which we us a lot especi the sort of equip we emploi most dure the war and in ani econom ventur the finish price is veri import for instanc if we follow a programm of self suffici and decid to produc someth local it might cost dollar 5 000 wherea we might be abl to bui the same thing abroad for dollar 1 000 thi would not make econom sens the aircraft flown to iran dure the gulf war we have hand back the civilian aircraft includ the kuwaiti aircraft unfortun the kuwaiti did not even pai us the mainten and park expens for their aircraft but we thought that if we kept those aircraft park in tehran much longer it would not reflect well on us internation of cours a number of iraqi fighter jet also intrud on iranian airspac the civilian aircraft ask permiss first which is why we hand them back but we still have not decid whether to hand over the fighter jet we have to wait for the un sanction committe to see what thei have to sai i am sure thei will do someth about the expens incur in have those iraqi plane in iran and will take appropri measur becaus the fighter jet ar of a make which we do not have in our air forc our ground personnel have been unabl to keep them flight readi none of those fighter can fly ani more an aircraft is like a live be you cannot just leav it in the desert and then push the starter button when you want to fly
