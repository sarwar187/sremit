more than meet the ey in the good new stori the absenc of ward closur for exampl can be attribut to a pound 200m slush fund held back by the govern to bail out importun hospit thi is no more than prudent plan given the upheav of the reform but it hardli fit in with the idea of an intern market where purchas and produc must behav like ration profit maximis as for the drop in wait list of longer

pursu hi artist instinct eventu he said he and hi audienc would reunit and true to hi word he ha rebound thi year with an album freedom that recal the grace and insight of the most prize 70s materi not surprisingli the repris record work is shape up as the most acclaim album of 1989 it hasn t caught on with the public yet it peak at no 35 on the billboard chart becaus radio plai ha been minim even on rock station that onc champion young on reason mai be that much of the pop rock commun ha becom so skeptic of young that even the glow review aren t enough to make them bui hi album radio is a touchi point with young i hate all thi nonsens about radio format he said sharpli if someth doesn t fit a station s imag or sound then it doesn t get plai and there ar certain station that won t plai me regardless of what the record is like thei don t want to plai music that their parent listen to becaus it doesn t fit their imag so i am box in with these classic rock artist which is realli sicken to have work all thi time and be box in like that and cut off of altern radio and colleg radio just becaus i ve last so long the radio outburst asid young seem especi comfort as the old cadillac pur along the wind road mayb even a tad amus that the pop world ha suddenli began herald him again a lot of peopl seem to think i made a lot of those record as a joke or someth just to be differ young said but the truth is you go where the music take you i never want to lose public favor or critic acclaim i alwai would like that but it s pure coincident when it come i live each album while i m do it i m kind of like a bad friend i guess becaus i m into on thing so much that you think oh thi gui is commit to thi for life but then i m gone and i m into someth els the same wai young s new album which offer mani of the classic young strain is the onli new studio releas thi year to get maximum five star rate from both roll stone and england s highli regard q magazin even the villag voic s stingi robert christgau gave the album an unqualifi a grade though frequent describ as a polit album freedom is about the search for fulfil and integr in both person and social set rockin in the free world which open and close the album look at the ironi between the promis of freedom and the casualti of human indiffer sampl lyric there s color on the street red white and blue peopl shufflin their feet peopl sleepin in their shoe but there s a warnin sign on the road ahead there s a lot of peopl sayin we d be better off dead don t feel like satan but i am to them so i try to forget it ani wai i can in hangin on a limb he look at the issu of commit in relationship when the melodi through the window call it echo in the courtyard and whisper in the hall he plai it through the night she knew he had to go there wa someth about freedom he thought he didn t know iron in view of the hail of applaus freedom wasn t the album that young had plan to releas he came within dai of releas anoth album a much harder edg collect titl eldorado which ha been releas in japan i had turn it into the record compani and it wa all readi to go when i realiz that the album wouldn t have had a chanc he said peopl were so us to get surpris from me that if i put out thi real heavi kind of speed metal album thei would just sai oh there s crazi neil just do someth strang again thei wouldn t see the album for what it wa thei d just stop at the style so he stop warner bro record from releas the album return instead to the studio to record some other tune he end up with 32 track repres both new song and a few that had been written year ago but left off earlier album becaus thei didn t fit the mood of the album the kei song in bring the freedom album s theme togeth he said wa rockin in the free world there s a lot to be discourag about in the world todai but it s hard not to be hope too becaus of all that is happen he said who ever believ all thi would happen in eastern europ i m go to do some acoust show in europ soon and i can t wait to get over there and see it up close the report had assum when young pick him up at a restaur just outsid of woodsid that thei were head to young s ranch but young just kept drive he did stop at a beach just south of half moon bai for the photograph to take some pictur but then he return to the mountain road stop onli for a sandwich at a rural market where he ha a run tab it wa clear young prefer talk in the comfort of hi car and the road the question dealt with the affect of outsid influenc on the creativ process gener you ignor posit critic becaus it s usual not construct he said matter of factli it tell you that you ar do a good job which you alreadi feel or you wouldn t be do it sometim a neg review will get you though certain thing stick with you especi nag littl thing turn to hi passeng he said i rememb someth you wrote at a concert i did in 1976 you thought the show wa too short and i wa go to send you a gold watch from me to you so that you could time my next appear if you thought time wa so import young smile at the admiss in defens the report said the point of the review wa that the concert wa young s first appear in lo angel sinc the tonight s the night album had been releas and that young didn t do ani song from the album the complaint wa that young could have extend the 95 minut show to includ some of the tonight s the night materi but time had noth to do with it he said without hesit i couldn t do those song that s the point peopl try to look at concert in all sort of wai how long it last why you didn t do that song or that on what thei don t understand is that you don t alwai have the freedom to do anyth and there s no reason why you should even if you can a perform should be awar of the audienc but he can t let the audienc dictat what he should do that 1976 show wa repres of me that night i couldn t have done the tonight s the night album then becaus it wa a group of song from a particular time a certain charact you don t alwai feel that charact look at the cover and you see that person that wasn t the same person you saw on after the gold rush or harvest you chang young is work on a mammoth 25th anniversari retrospect album that will contain hi best known number some person favorit and lot of the dozen of record that have never been releas it s due late next year how about the impact of sale on hi music direct i hope to win everi time out but if i don t it doesn t matter i ve had enough success i never realli kept track of it except gener but now i have a comput program and i can check it out see graph see progress see what s happen but it s mostli an excus to us the comput becaus i m interest in graph and comput the sale don t affect what i m go to do next young went through some person trial in the 80s he experienc post polio syndrom a few year ago that wa so sever he couldn t even pick up the guitar with hi hand he subsequ enter a vigor program of physic therapi to regain

initi an educ program in the bai area inspir larg by their experi in rais two children with cerebr palsi what about the effect of hi person life on hi work without go into specif he simpli note yeah well that s a big subject that s everyth critic sale that s noth compar to the thing in your life young and hi white caddi must be familiar to local resid becaus two men in the market nod and a young hitch hiker on the road later wave as the car pass by young honk in return at the hitch hiker the convers wander back to the dai when young wa in lo angel down from canada in hope of fulfil hi rock n roll dream young smile for a second at the imag of him all those year ago i think naivet and luck got him through he said there wa also the ambit and all the other stuff but a lot of peopl have that
