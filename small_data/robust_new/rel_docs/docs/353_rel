on ecolog safeti nezavisimaya gazeta 13 januari 1994 neither i nor anyon els in the environment protect system wa surpris at that reaction we have long sinc becom accustom to aleksei vladimirovich s incompet and emot outburst but i do feel compel to write to the newspap again becaus that incompet caus the distort of certain fact that ar quit obviou or els easili verifi as well as incorrect and subject interpret of other fact and such exagger that the likelihood of reader be misinform is simpli too great to ignor provision but onli provision on could divid yablokov s respons into three section firstli a descript of russia s terribl environment problem secondli a tale of how the ministri of environment protect and natur resourc depriv of mr yablokov s skill leadership either cannot or will not function and final a third section contain assert of a polit natur which clearli reek of denunci let us begin with the most simpl fact and the thing that evid enrag my oppon most of all my elect as deputi to the state duma i wa elect on a slate of candid from the russia s choic associ and i wa elect in nizhegorod elector district becaus the associ s slate wa divid up into geograph district in full complianc with the elect statut i did not lose anywher nor did i attempt to regist anywher except in nizhnii novgorod so why did yablokov not even bother to inquir of the central elect committe exactli how i got elect and along those same line what doe the word self appoint in the final paragraph of hi articl mean could it be that yablokov think i appoint myself minist on thing is clear that kind of mistak is impermiss not onli for a politician but for ani state offici even on who stand apart from polit though at on time yablokov wa activ in polit and serv as a ussr peopl s deputi now let us turn to ecolog and begin with organiz and administr matter unfortun at thi time it is by no mean just the russian feder ministri of environment protect and natur resourc that is respons for the environ the state of natur resourc and natur resourc us in russia in addit to it there ar at least 11 other feder agenc deal with those matter and six of those organ the russian feder committe on fish the ministri of agricultur s hunt depart russian feder oversight of nuclear and radiat safeti russian feder mine and industri oversight and the russian feder state committe for sanitari epidemiolog oversight have alwai been wholli independ of the ministri of environment protect and natur resourc yet yablokov hold me account for all of them when i talk about the result of our effort about our problem the mean of solv them and our capabl in the first approxim i am refer to a framework establish by current legisl act in addit on must also take into account the actual social and econom situat in the countri the thing that societi will agre to do and the thing that it plainli will not accept at thi time thing ar veri comfort when the gnp is rise and the central distribut portion thereof is increas in that case everyon can be alloc a littl bit more and high prioriti area environment protect for exampl can be given more than anyon els but if the amount of monei be distribut is not grow then on area can onli receiv someth at the expens of anoth for exampl the pension fund health care servic educ scienc cultur etc it is even wors when the gnp and the central distribut portion thereof ar decreas in that case the amount of fund receiv by each section of the state s budget also decreas and in order to increas alloc in on area it is necessari to impoverish other area even more add to that the fact that thei ar alreadi lose monei due to the worsen econom situat on must have exception high prioriti in the ey of societi to get addit fund under these condit but of cours yablokov is awar that the declin standard of live higher crime rate unemploy polit problem stem from the collaps of the soviet union and mani other thing have releg environment protect to a place of veri low prioriti in public opinion under these condit on must look at thing realist and ask for whatev societi is will to give even if that mean take a pure market orient posit and frame the issu like thi what is better in term of improv in the environ s prioriti rank constant perform of requiem or reason and inform base on the actual function of the environment protect system i am convinc that the latter is better yablokov write budgetari fund for the field is such that the entir russian ministri of environment protect system is on the verg of collaps as for collaps that is an outright lie and just show me anyon whose budgetari fund situat is ani better without the slightest effort i could name 15 ministri and agenc where thing ar wors if the environment situat were catastroph bad throughout the entir territori of russia that would be a death sentenc for all of human it is strang that yablokov ha somehow overlook the biospher as a whole and the role plai in it by our golden ecolog reserv the more than on third of russia s territori that remain virtual untouch by commerci activ 7 8 million squar kilomet fortun overal thi is not yet a catastroph it is a problem and on which can and should be solv on must not forget that 30 year ago an extrem sever environment situat wa observ in mani region of europ the unit state and japan the situat there often coincid exactli with what we ar current see primarili in metal manufactur citi in baykalsk and in industri center in the ural and the volga region the post industri countri have solv thi problem though on must admit that thei have done so larg at the expens of the third world and the world at larg i am convinc that we will also solv it and we will attempt to do so not at anyon els s expens us our own scientif and technic resourc instead of export environ intens type of product abroad i have written on mani occas about the fact that that process could begin in russia togeth with an econom upturn that solut to the problem of the economi and the environ must be implement simultan that introduct of the new technolog that will allow our economi to lower it overhead and improv it product qualiti and competit on the world market will at the same time make it possibl to achiev radic chang in the interact between the economi and natur no there is no wai to build a normal economi without a normal environ but equal pointless is the posit that sai first the environ then the economi what is need here is calm calcul persist dai to dai effort to assess and monitor complianc with decis environment inspect further develop of the econom mechan for environment protect and natur resourc us which even now is function just fine improv of the tax system and develop of environment protect legisl to mani peopl that seem pretti bore and most of these ar thing you would not talk about at a demonstr for exampl but the futur of our environ and the ecolog health of our countri will depend primarili on these effort i am surpris by the number of scientif error constantli made by yablokov in what scientif sourc did he read that there is an ozon hole over the northern hemispher and over russia in particular over the antarct ye there is or rather there is a hole that appear and disappear depend on season variat but the onli thing that ha been record over the northern hemispher is a deplet of the ozon layer fortun we still have a long wai to go befor we have a hole the caus of thi extrem unpleas phenomenon did not come about in just the past three to five year larg scale product of ozon layer destroi chlorofluorocarbon goe back sever decad and mani of them continu to live in the atmospher the effect of those that ar alreadi there will onli ceas sever decad from now yet read that particular passag in yablokov s articl the uninform reader could well think that the russian ministri of environment protect ha through it bungl creat an ozon hole in the past two year thing that can be forgiven an environmentalist speaker address a ralli ar unpardon come from a correspond member of the russian academi of scienc just as thei ar unpardon come from a high level govern offici or consid thi excerpt sinc the state of the environ is respons for roughli 30 percent of our health on year out of the three year of decreas in averag life expect in 1993 is due to the environ but just what is 30 percent of our health after declar rate of ill a health factor yablokov draw thi astound conclus sinc roughli a third of the report ill rate is attribut to the environment factor accord to him then consequ for everi three year of declin in life expect on year is due to that factor how can on respond to that doctor ar well awar that diseas rate ar not so simpli and directli connect with life expect especi if on consid onli report ill base on hospit record as is done in virtual everi studi yablokov seem veri prone to mistak hi claim for the final author on truth in hi opinion the minist delai for more than a year the develop of a system of measur stem from the decis by the un confer on sustain develop sign by russia in rio de janeiro it is a well known fact that those decis were sign by more than 150 countri of the world and i would like for yablokov to name me even five that have approv ani such system of measur at the government level the russian ministri of environment protect in conjunct with other affect ministri and agenc ha in fact submit a draft plan to the govern yablokov level the same charg at me at a meet of the govern s commiss on environment protect and natur resourc us but as is hi custom did not stai until the end and left the meet befor i wa abl to repli for that reason he remain ignor of the arbitrari natur of hi assess the russian ministri of environment protect compli with all legal standard law and subleg act and cannot as an organ of state execut author oper in ani other wai at the start of thi letter address the ministri s task function and right i wrote in the first approxim the second approxim clearli is to conscious and purposefulli chang guidelin that do not satisfi the environment protect system base on consider of principl and an overal scientif assess of our task and function not to violat the guidelin but rather to chang them act within the bound of the law we ar veri dissatisfi with the current statut on the russian ministri of environment protect and natur resourc and have prepar a new version we have gotten approv for it from all ministri and agenc and we ar now wait for govern approv but unfortun due to the govern s reorgan that approv ha been delai we ar in mani wai dissatisfi with the current law on environment protect but the we have prepar a draft of a new feder law to be entitl on environment protect and sustain develop and ar readi to submit it to the state duma in the near futur true if it were not for the parliamentari crisi we would have done so month earlier all of thi add up to not veri favor condit surround the ministri but i am not inclin to keep count of our defeat otherwis on would have to regard the entir histori of ani ministri as an unbroken seri of defeat these ar just difficulti the kind that ar quit normal for ani aspect of govern work and for ani ministri or agenc we do not overli dramat the situat we ar do our job incident a brief report on our work is includ in the state report i have alreadi mention and is submit to the govern on a monthli basi in addit to our annual report yablokov should be familiar with all these materi it just seem that he ha no interest in them now a word about the all russian congress on ecolog and environment protect thi is definit a us idea and the russian ministri of environment protect ha been an activ support of it from the start but conven a congress without ani preparatori work would be absolut pointless major organiz prepar ar requir nor will a program for russia s ecolog reviv come about by itself it will have to be develop all that take monei peopl to do the work and an appropri organ at a board meet of the russian ministri of environment protect thi matter wa consid in the presenc of yablokov who state that he want to be head of the organ committe that would organ the congress the embarrass board member said noth and no decis as to who should be assign to head the organiz committe wa made at that time firstli it is a well known fact that in other countri such event ar usual head by the presid the vice presid or the prime minist not by an advisor secondli yablokov doe not have ani substanti apparatu support him and that mean the whole organiz burden would fall on the russian ministri of environment protect we ar also veri familiar with yablokov s leadership style and we were simpli horrifi at the prospect the russian deleg to the rio confer wa head not too successfulli by a v rutskoi whose statu would be fulli appropri for the head of an organ committe as for the assert that i need polit close to rutskoi that statement could onli elicit laughter from anyon who ha the slightest familiar with the issu incident in term of the mourn tone of hi environment speech a v rutskoi ha alwai been veri close to a v yablokov there is a great deal of evid that i have never sought polit close to rutskoi and yablokov himself could call some to mind if he would try back in the fall of 1992 there wa no mention of polit battl in connect with the elect or anyth els of the kind as for me i have never betrai my democrat belief and my liber econom concept and there is no wai that i can regard rutskoi as an alli base either on psycholog makeup or ideolog consider as for the assert that he ha no us for me whatsoev i have never had ani doubt about that where is the environment program yablokov ask i have alreadi mention it it is the document that ha been submit for govern approv prepar in accord with the decis of the un confer in rio de janeiro and the followup confer on the environ for europ held in lucern a year later the document wa complet exactli on schedul as for why our govern ha avoid further develop and implement it that is a question that should be address to the head of govern not to me in a postscript to hi respons to me yablokov state that he intend to focu hi effort on the russian secur council s interag commiss on ecolog safeti of that commiss he write the commiss s decis ar subject to review by organ of state author it is obviou that it is precis author that attract a v yablokov the author to be irrespons and that ha alwai been hi posit he ha monitor and instruct the ministri and sent it almost 1 000 letter in a year and a half yet ha never been account for anyth but he ha a veri dim concept of how to us author the same is true now i look at hi commiss s plan and i can see that he will be lucki if on twentieth of them will ever actual come befor the secur council all the rest will be just static anoth sourc of annoy for those who have

tibet from the peruvian and and the ocean floor core taken in the mountain of tibet by lonni thompson of the univers of ohio cloud and ocean the data gap that truli bedevil the model maker howev ar not the vagari of climat histori but a lack of the inform need to fathom climat feedback process and the contribut of ocean and cloud to cool and warm process the no 1 prioriti scientist gener agre is to learn more about cloud thi is where the scarciti of inform is most profound the broader question beg to be answer said gordon j macdonald a former chairman of the us council on environment qualiti who began studi global warm nearli 20 year ago concern the balanc of cloud type and the effect of climat warm on their format and distribut although it is establish that cloud have an overal cool effect by reflect sunlight thei have not becom a part of global climat model becaus so mani cloud of all type ar so small and so wide scatter scientist have yet to put togeth a coher pictur of their format their characterist and their dissip there is vast ignor about the reflect of small cloud the process that go on insid them and their local effect we ar just begin to understand the physic process and the relev of the altitud and type said gui brasseur an atmospher chemist at the nation center for atmospher research the role of the ocean is somewhat better understood although inform is also limit sea surfac data on a global scale is veri spotti said robert w correl vice chairman of the committe on earth scienc which coordin us global chang research there ar mani area of the world where we have no data at all zilch the most sophist ocean model is done at the geophys fluid dynam lab where scientist have been at it for 20 year in a studi there last year syukuro manab and hi

fear it would provid an excus for delai need action in that debat scientist for the most part remain on the sidelin mani of them counsel against try to overwhelm the problem with massiv infus of monei ted we ar data limit and we ar talent limit mahlman said but i have made myself unpopular with peopl who want to throw monei at the climat problem if somebodi told me thei want to doubl the geophys fluid dynam lab budget next year i would sai no the overal effort to produc reliabl model will be massiv expens nevertheless the cost of collect the crucial ocean and cloud data will dwarf the outlai

of thing to come on earth observ system platform will produc 10 trillion byte of data daili the plan is to have two of them in orbit at a time for 15 year onli by compil more and more data can scientist hope to achiev the necessari precis in their climatolog model the coars grid now in us have data point that ar about 500 kilomet apart if we ar to understand more specif the region respons

power increas by a factor of 10 we think the predict of region respons requir a resolut of 50 to 100 kilomet so we need two or three new gener of comput equal import to some scientist is understand what the model ar sai mahlman recent tri to run a high resolut model on the old comput at the geophys fluid dynam lab the on that is to be replac with the new crai ymp i have been abl to run it but i
