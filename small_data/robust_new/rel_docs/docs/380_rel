and drawback of engin food is left larg to the consum the fda regul food addit and food for special dietari us but it scrutini is limit larg to the product s safeti the agenc examin an addit s chemic structur and the level at which it is toxic in anim but it doe not address whether the product is nutrition benefici or desir sai gerad l mccowin who head the fda divis of food and color addit that there s a synthet fat substitut or an artifici sweeten avail in and of itself is neither good nor bad societ or nutrition he sai what s good or bad is how the individu combin those variou food a prime target of food engin is fat fat current make up 37 to 40 of the averag american adult s calor intak but expert in heart diseas and cancer have recommend that american lower that level to 30 or less most attempt to reduc fat in anim product have involv simpl physic step such as close trim of beef cut through select breed farmer have also been reduc the back fat in hog and abdomin fat in poultri so call restructur dismantl a piec of meat and put the part back togeth as a new product is be us to produc leaner meat although research sai that salt is ad to the meat in the process thei sai it is in quantiti too small to tast some new lite deli meat mai have a greater problem with salt accord to the institut of food technologist for that reason the group conclud that modifi conveni food mai offer littl nutrit advantag over carefulli select fresh meat but the most radic assault on fat is come from substitut sucros polyest is made by chemic link sever fatti acid molecul to a molecul of sucros or tabl sugar becaus of it structur it is not metabol by the bodi and therefor contribut no fat calori or cholesterol procter gambl which call the product olestra ha appli to the fda to us it in shorten and oil if us wide olestra theoret could replac up to 35 of the fat in retail shorten and up to 75 of the fat us for fry snack food and in deep fry at those level the compani figur that olestra consum could cut their daili fat consumpt by five gram out of an averag intak of 80 to 90 gram the percentag of fat calori in their diet would drop from 37 to 35 accord to the compani the other fat substitut befor the fda is simpless produc by the nutrasweet co it consist of milk and egg protein cook and blend in such a wai as to simul what food scientist like to call the mouth feel of fat unlik olestra simpless is digest but it ha less than half the calori of ordinari fat it would be us in product such as salad dress mayonnais and ic cream but not for cook nutrasweet predict it could reduc a person s fat calori to 32 the fat substitut offer excit opportun for us to have the satisfact we get out of product that contain fat without the extra weight gain sai fred caporaso chairman of food scienc and nutrit at chapman colleg in orang that s kind of neat i think as long as thei re safe the fda is studi the safeti of the fat substitut both compani sai their product ar harmless in the context of a balanc diet although nutrasweet note that simpless should not be eaten by peopl sensit or allerg to milk or egg as for olestra procter gambl sai it would not affect absorpt of dietari protein and carbohydr or of most fat solubl vitamin becaus it could reduc absorpt of vitamin e the compani intend to supplement olestra with that vitamin on consum group the center for scienc in the public interest ha challeng procter gambl s safeti claim and the anim studi on which it is base it ha ask the fda to requir more studi explor the long term effect of olestra us on professor of food scienc at the univers of arkansa rais a more philosoph object to the advent of food that ar not what thei seem it put an intellectu dimens in eat that i m person concern about sai harri e snyder i just don t want to ask everi time i sit down is thi real or fake and should i adjust accordingli i want to know it s all real food a second target of food engin is sugar three low calori and non nutrit sweeten ar be us wide despit question about their effect on health and despit the fact that consumpt of sugar ha continu to rise the oldest is saccharin a non nutrit sweeten that is not metabol and therefor non calor it remain in us under special congression dispens in spite of research data suggest it mai contribut to bladder cancer an fda move to ban saccharin ha been suspend until at least 1992 pend further research product contain saccharin bear a health warn but review by the american medic assn and food technologist have fail to establish a health risk a second sugar substitut is aspartam or nutrasweet a protein that carri with it four calori per gram becaus it is up to 220 time as sweet as tabl sugar aspartam can be us in such small amount that it is virtual non calor it appear to be safe in moder numer group have determin yet there have been anecdot report of vision problem seizur headach and dizzi aspartam account for four of everi five complaint to the fda concern advers reaction to food addit the third avail sweeten is acesulfam k also known as sunett approv in juli 1988 for us in dry mix for beverag instant coffe pud non dairi creamer and chew gum it is not metabol and therefor contribut no calori to the diet profession opinion about the benefit of artifici sweeten remain mix bidlack call aspartam probabl the most outstand thing that happen to the sweet market becaus of it safeti and sweeten power but other ar more skeptic i think health profession ar still wonder whether there s ani real valu in make a sweet product that doesn t have ani health benefit of ani kind snyder sai after all he sai there is no evid that sweeten have cut overal sugar consumpt the next frontier for food engin is cholesterol believ by mani research to be a prime culprit in cardiovascular diseas becaus more than a third of dietari cholesterol come from egg mani research have focus on egg first some farmer claim to have alreadi produc reduc cholesterol egg through select breed and control of chicken diet some chicken have been fed fish oil believ by some to lower cholesterol level but the egg have occasion end up smell of fish other research ar test more esoter techniqu donald beitz a professor of anim scienc and biochemistri at iowa state univers is work with an enzym produc by bacteria in the human gut accord to beitz the enzym break down cholesterol into an innocu product that is then excret beitz ha test extract contain the the enzym on milk ground pork and egg yolk and ha produc the expect breakdown product he is now attempt to develop more of the enzym which he hope some dai might be avail to be sprinkl on high cholesterol food on other area that ha attract food engin attent is fiber specif ad fiber to food epidemiolog studi have link reduc rate of some cancer and gastrointestin diseas to diet heavi in high fiber food for that reason food manufactur have begun supplement bake good with sugar beet fiber and appl and oat fiber so call light bread often contain ad fiber as do mani cereal and high fiber hamburg bun the us depart of agricultur ha develop someth call fluffi cellulos to serv as a non calor fiber replac for flour deriv from sugar beet pulp or other agricultur byproduct it can replac up to half the flour in cake or bread there appear to be no risk involv with such product accord to expert in the nutrit benefit of fiber although some note that excess fiber could limit absorpt of import dietari miner in a person with a margin diet yet mani nutritionist ar skeptic about fiber supplement

food you consum a whole rang of nutrient sai barbara schneeman a professor of nutrit at uc davi if you select some of these fiber supplement you mai not be get the whole packag of nutrient all kind of fiber ar be sold out there labuza sai we don t realli know whether some perform the function peopl think thei perform and if take them out of on food and put them in anoth thei would still have the same function on check on the prolifer of some engin food so far ha been the abil of manufactur to market their product outdat regul on food composit have made some compani reluct to manufactur
