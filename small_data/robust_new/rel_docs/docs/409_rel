airlin member that befor thei can begin discuss about bilater or multi later special contract to bypass compens limit anti trust immun is requir from the us competit author offici iata polici is that map3 the third protocol to the montreal agreement should be brought into forc map3 would rais the montreal limit from dollar 75 000 to dollar 130 000 and allow it sovereign signatori to set up supplement compens plan scp thi would give rise to a two tier system airlin would be respons for the first dollar 130 000 for each passeng and the scp would provid compens abov that amount for which passeng would pai an enforc levi the practic view howev is that map3 is a dead letter map3 cannot come into forc until it ha been ratifi by at least 30 state which is regard as unlik unless the us support the move washington s posit on compens is unclear but it is gener accept within the industri that the us will not now ratifi map3 there is some support for the japanes initi in the us but

manufactur mr martin sai it is astonish that airlin do not act individu or collect it is inconceiv that us anti trust author would take action against airlin discuss measur to benefit the travel public and he insist insur must be avail on the world market at a reason price perhap the biggest disappoint of the past 12 month is that the japanes initi appear to have left the travel public cold in theori the absenc of ani limit on liabil or higher limit ought to have a big impact on consum choic and could offer airlin that adopt it a competit advantag the problem is that airlin cannot easili advertis the concept that in the event of a death some airlin will pai more compens than their competitor survei of the factor influenc choic of airlin among busi travel show that the public is more interest in effici conveni schedul punctual and speed of check in than with secur liabil and insur until that chang world class airlin will be free to hide behind compens limit not avail to other
