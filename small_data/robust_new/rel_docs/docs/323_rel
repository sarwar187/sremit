will take effect when no fewer than 65 state ratifi it the convent ha now been sign by 154 state but ratifi by onli four countri which do not have chemic weapon and which actual do not have to assum ani oblig thi is a veri seriou problem for other countri that do have such weapon the condit and facil for the destruct of chemic weapon need to be creat the main proport of the world stockpil of such weapon ar concentr in the unit state and russia thi is why the issu of destroi chemic weapon is the most acut for these two state nezavisimaya gazeta what doe the russian chemic weapon complex amount to on find absolut contradictori inform in the press gorbovskii the russian chemic weapon complex mean first of all the stockpil kept at storag facil the total quantiti of the stockpil ha been declar and come to 40 000 tonn of toxic substanc ov russia also ha facil for the product of toxic substanc the princip facil ar in volgograd and novocheboksarsk chuvashia last year an interdepartment commiss whose task it wa to inspect all storag facil for toxic substanc verifi the reliabl of chemic weapon storag and provis for the safeti of the popul as chairman of the abov commiss i can confirm the number given 40 000 tonn nezavisimaya gazeta is it possibl to sai what the qualit composit of these 40 000 tonn is and in which region russian chemic weapon ar mostli locat gorbovskii the most up to date nerv substanc sarin soman and v ga vi gaz account for approxim 32 000 tonn the remaind consist of obsolet substanc mustard ga and lewisit which have been store sinc as earli as the 1950 s data on the geographi of the locat of such weapon ar no longer secret we have exchang inform with the american on the militari chemic facil the geograph coordin of their locat precis to the second have been provid all these facil ar locat in the european section of russia we have seven storag site toxic substanc mustard ga lewisit ar kept in contain at two site storag is within munit at five site two storag facil out of these five hold missil and artilleri munit and three storag site aircraft chemic munit the easternmost facil is in chelyabinsk oblast those in bryansk and penza oblast ar the closest to moscow the 40 000 tonn ar distribut among these storag facil approxim evenli at 5 000 7 000 tonn per storag site nezavisimaya gazeta what is the guarante shelf life of chemic munit gorbovskii more than 80 percent of toxic substanc ar found within munit whose bodi ensur their reliabl storag the inspect of arsen reveal that a case of leakag ha not been regist at ani of them recent american chemic munit have thinner shell thi is precis why their chemic munit have becom disabl sooner for exampl rocket artilleri munit leak by the mid 1970 s the american were forc to encas them in concret and dump them in the ocean nezavisimaya gazeta what is 40 000 tonn equal to in term of so to sai destruct coeffici gorbovskii a lethal dose of v ga the most up to date chemic toxic agent come to 10 milligram per person thi is a virtual invis aerosol particl it is easi to calcul the number of potenti victim by simpl divis if we know the total stockpil of chemic weapon howev thi would be an incompet calcul it doe not take into account actual condit for the us of all weapon for exampl if we compar how much explos wa us dure world war ii and the number of peopl who were destroi it will turn out that there were hundr of kilogram of trinitrotoluen per person kill the same is the case in the event of combat us of chemic weapon kilogram and ten of kilogram of toxic substanc per each casualti approxim the same casualti rate should also be reckon with dure accid nezavisimaya gazeta what ar the specif of russian problem associ with implement of the provis of the convent gorbovskii

copi of hi own speech and an invit to the labor leader to feel free to borrow anyth he want but then thoma mallon reflect in stolen word polit is not so seriou and dirti a busi as literatur mallon is a writer who possess grace and wit a delight in incongru and a quick to love hard and grow furiou the grace the wit the incongru spotter and the love were all evid in a book of on s own hi marvel beguil account of literari diari all these qualiti ar present in mallon s book on literari plagiar except that the love is pretti much replac by the furi he thought of call it not a book of on s own but chang hi mind which seem a piti instead he call it stolen word as if to signal that he wa feel angri and not play mallon i expect will never not be play but hi rage is us plagiar is the vacuum that natur abhor it is a quiet chilli excav vice like pick on s nose when nobodi is look it take mallon s fieri even if it sometim seem excess to get us to pai attent on of the characterist of plagiar in fact is that there is a certain tendenc to excus it writer began to complain serious about it or defend themselv against it around the time of shakespear nobodi mind virgil borrow from homer but almost immedi mallon find the denounc denounc as petti mind in two of the three case he studi in detail he us each of these chapter to weav in other exampl along with gener reflect he discov a reluct to confront a fact and a tendenc to minim it like rape he write it is a crime with the odd abil to make other feel guilti there is a detail and absorb studi of a professor at texa tech who repeatedli us other materi and who wa allow quietli to resign even though some of hi colleagu want some more energet action the man involv mallon name him as jaym sokolov eventu publish hi disput version in a somewhat revis version and when complaint of plagiar persist wrote note of apolog in the american histor assn journal and insert errata slip in the remain volum mallon s point is the lack of public denunci by the professor s peer then there wa wild oat by jacob epstein a comic novel about the enthusiasm and predica of an american colleg student which appear in 1980 it wa prais by sever promin writer perhap too snide mallon give the impress that some of the prais wa due to the fact that jacob s parent were influenti editor he doe not deni the author s talent a consider scandal result when the english novelist martin ami wrote an articl cite half a dozen highli distinct passag that were almost ident to passag in hi own well prais the rachel paper publish in 1974 mallon quot them there were 53 such passag in all ami complain the british author seem to have made hi disclosur reluctantli and mallon write that he still rather regret it ami own publish corli smith who on might have thought would have been outrag suggest that the affair had been overplai mallon suppli anger for both of them it is besid the point he write that the two book were differ in spirit and tone and that much of jacob s book wa origin that is like sai that although 50 stolen item ar found in a burglar s hous 2 000 item were not stolen and he add in wick deadpan the book don t feel overal veri much alik it s just that thei ar sometim exactli the same onc or twice i find mallon persnicketi in cite transgress and there is the borderlin case of tristram shandi whose author laurenc stern got a good mani of uncl tobi s sai from richard burton s anatomi of melancholi mallon grant that tristram is an extraordinari origin but he take issu with scholarli indulg and the argument that reader would recogn the burton adag stern he said got a free ride he ha a point but what is the altern could uncl tobi realli be expect to put footnot in hi mouth by and larg though hi distinct ar fair not cite the authorship of a well known phrase is legitim after all on could put an end to literari allus if on fear the footnot polic behind everi punctuat mark self plagiar is gener ok no writer want hi work to have just on temporari or inconspicu life and stylist influenc or osmosi is more than ok joan didion he is sure wa influenc earli on by hemingwai s sentenc he know that he himself wa influenc by didion no on will ever amount to anyth unless hi earli read leak into hi first write plagiar is not mainli or necessarili us plot or situat that other have us it is necessarili and alwai us their word unattribut word steal is the fuel to mallon s fire it is unforgiv writer write abov all more for ident than for monei he tell us you can bear your wallet be stolen so long as you keep the photograph lose on s word mean lose on s self respect if ego stop matter then veri like writer would stop write or at least stop write so frequent and so well
