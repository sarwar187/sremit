nuclear instal as well as the necessari equip and technolog to make it possibl to conduct experi with nuclear explos in ani case there is no doubt that the two side have agre in write with regard to their intent to make deal such as these abov and beyond that tehran hope to get someth by mean of smuggl materi and human expertis the curiou thing is that presid rafsanjani when pass through baku on hi wai back from kazakhstan issu a verbal threat on behalf of the muslim of the world against the armenian aggressor but these threat were littl more than an effort to flatter hi azerbaijani host the larg armenian commun in iran occupi an influenti posit in busi and trade in addit to the fact that there ar lot of armenian specialist most of whom have come to iran recent especi from armenia who work in iranian nuclear instal and the scientif research institut and plant that had the job of produc soviet nuclear weapon missil and space equip were locat in all of the soviet republ includ armenia right now armenian nuclear scientist and technician cannot find ani work in the field that thei work in becaus of the unemploy crisi that ha led to a paralysi of the entir armenian industri and becaus of the cut off of necessari suppli that us to come from plant scatter all over the former soviet union that thei us to deal with for thi reason thei ar look for work in other countri especi in iran and iraq where thei see great opportun to util their expertis and knowledg thu it is doubt that tehran would antagon the armenian commun which support the iranian regim econom and financi and produc it weapon thi is someth that baku appar also realiz and alma ata feel that the nuclear arsen it is be forc to destroi could bring lot of revenu to kazakhstan if it would do the smart thing with it rubbl alma ata could earn an estim hundr of million of dollar if it to some degre also oversaw thi unlicens busi trip to the plutonium burial site the activ of the iranian envoi in russia indic that tehran is take seriou practic step to get what it want after the talk in kazakhstan were over farsangadari and shariqi return to moscow from there the former went to dusseldorf while the latter took a plane to the russian citi of ekaterinburg on 5 novemb where he rode by automobil to the citi of verkhn isetsk a citi that wa not shown on map of the soviet union and to which entri wa deni even to soviet citizen unless thei had special permiss it is known now that thi citi is the locat of on of the center of the soviet nuclear industri shariqi stai in thi citi till 10 novemb and met with a number of peopl from the citi as well as some guest who came in from chelyabinsk and krasnoyarsk it is not difficult to figur out the topic dealt with by the iranian guest at these meet especi if we know that in chelyabinsk 40 and krasnoyarsk 26 thei have buri larg quantiti of us nuclear fuel which came from all of the soviet fleet soviet nuclear power plant and even from finnish nuclear instal also for exampl after the break up of the soviet union into independ republ no less than three ton of plutonium wa sent there from ukrain it is said that ukrain appar want to regain thi plutonium in order to sell it and for thi reason refus to pai the bill for buri it howev the nuclear weapon non prolifer treati forbid russia from return the plutonium to ukrain becaus it is offici at least not a nuclear power in such a case some of those in charg of buri the nuclear wast might embark upon sell these materi without permiss the reason be that thei would of cours want to serv both the public interest and privat interest russian circl do not doubt that those work at the nuclear test site in semipalatinsk steer the iranian toward the nuclear scrap burial site in chelyabinsk and krasnoyarsk and that those in charg of these burial site knew in advanc that a repres from the iranian militari industri complex wa come to verkhn isetsk so thei went there to meet him whatev the case might be the iranian buyer met the russian seller in verkhn isetsk and then thei made a deal their problem now is to figur out how to ship the materi to the iranian buyer the rout across the baltic republ is no longer a good on becaus it is now be strictli monitor and not even falsifi document will fool them so the onli thing left for the supplier to do is choos between a rout through the central asian republ which ar not separ from russia by border obstacl and a rout through the northern caucasu area and azerbaijan bear in mind that the caucasu area is full of highwai bandit led by field command who ar subject to no author and do not hesit to steal oil from pipelin and confisc truck load with powder milk and children s cloth but the most import question is what will the russian secur forc do sinc thei ar awar of these suspici deal the problem is that the secur apparatu ha to be content to mere monitor the buyer and seller becaus there ar no law that allow them to arrest them the most that the law allow is for them to arrest a move convoi but thi is someth that is hard to do as for the steal from the graveyard that is someth which in practic cannot be prove a thief can dump a ton of sand into the grave instead of the scrap that contain a high proport of plutonium and mix the sand with the radioact materi and it is imposs to tell the differ as for conduct analyt test of the whole burial site thi is someth that is veri expens to do and doe not serv the purpos consequ if the person who rais all the rucku concern dump liquid nuclear wast in the sea of japan on 17 octob had the goal of elimin the suppli channel of russian nuclear materi to place abroad via the pacif fleet in particular then most probabl he did not get what he want as long as there ar good for which there is a demand and those who possess the good wish to sell them thei will alwai find wai to market them illeg as for the nuclear materi and technolog those person in russia who possess them see no reason not to smuggl them to countri who ar rush to grab these commod as long as there is no obstacl that make do busi with nuclear materi either legal or illeg someth that is not profit either as far as russia or the other former soviet nuclear republ ar concern

attract of foreign middlemen to consumm the deal is also foreseen at the same time the compani ha the right to issu permit for export of militari product doesn t thi perpetu the possibl for public offici to financ privat middlemen under the tabl after all rv is a cumbersom organ and consequ it wouldn t be difficult at all for it worker to establish a firm for themselv somewher on the isl of man or in liberia and sell state own weapon through it depriv the countri of hard currenc profit in the exact same wai that the firm mig servi and remora ltd did strengthen statehood while dispens with

for exampl rv is endow with the right not onli to maintain a monopoli on trade in product of the militari industri complex but also to invest into it develop thi combin of function plu the absenc of supervis make it possibl for offici to siphon profit from the sale of public wealth into subsidiari especi foreign subsidiari and if the author do in fact wish to strengthen statehood and put thing in

by an entir differ state structur on not associ with rv separ of function creat an obstacl to embezzl of state properti who stand to gain from a monopoli in thi case rosvooruzheniy enjoi a complet monopoli over export of militari equip at the same time the procedur current effect in the usa is as follow after fill a state order a militari industri compani can then proce to work independ most importantli as long as it doe not violat the state concept of militari technic cooper the law and intern agreement sign by the govern and of cours the buyer must have an end user certif and a permit

perish from poverti the collect ar fall apart and citi in which defens industri is locat ar suffer but those in moscow who ar work to strengthen statehood have no wish to grant them thi right thi is not to mention the fact that we do not have a concept of militari technic cooper why is on need a monopoli on trade you see is a uniqu possibl for unconscienti plunder the manufactur for impos low purchas price on him or for rake in an ungodli percentag for intermediari servic and the manufactur can do noth about it he himself is prohibit from engag in trade you see an offici who market the good of some tank plant across the border ha to make some monei for himself and for hi subsidiari organ and for the western middleman what is left in thi case for the labor collect and it look like when the militari industri complex descend to abject poverti the middlemen will come to it as it privat savior with wallet bulg at the expens of the plant thi futur is a fulli possibl on in march 1992

highest bidder regardless of who it is if the nuclear materi and their technolog were sold with some caution and secreci the mass destruct weapon and the technolog of their product and even the chemic weapon were sold publicli here ar some exampl in novemb 1993 a medium size ship with 40 famili of russian refuge from the citi of krasnovodsk in turkmenistan on board arriv in the citi of astrakhan among these famili there were six famili whose breadwinn us to work at on of the secret workshop of the ammunit depot of the former soviet war fleet at thi workshop all the nuclear charg of the torpedo and sea mine were test and most of them were sent to the black sea fleet follow the disintegr of the ussr the new state of turkmenistan decid that it did not need these charg in the depot becaus it doe not have a fleet or naval air forc unit the entir depot wa sold in on year the sea mine workshop wa also sold the alreadi made product wa sold and the equip wa sold later the expert who return to russia said that iranian and pakistani were among the buyer the buyer offer the engin and the technician work at the workshop contract to work on the equip back in their countri for five year some of the former offic of the caspian sea fleet sign contract and left with the equip after work for more than a year and a half without salari arriv in astrakhan said that the famili of other offic lead a veri miser life in the open and that thei cannot return to russia in the same wai the gunpowd factori in the town of shusta place name as publish in the suburb of namangan in uzbekistan wa sold when it wa built in 1910 thi factori us to produc gunpowd later it becam a huge war institut special in produc air drop bomb it wa on of the three soviet factori where cluster bomb and vacuum

stop in the factori and the russian fear nationalist clash began to leav uzbekistan for russia ukrain and belaru the local central govern in tashkent began to sell the veri expens equip and technolog that wa in us at that time the same thing happen at the design offic which can be compar to a small research institut in thi field the string of buyer again includ iran and pakistan follow by india indonesia and iraq we can give dozen of exampl of thi kind the weapon of mass destruct spread all over the third world from all the republ of the former soviet union becaus of the lack of control and
