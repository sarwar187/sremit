FBIS3-54806: languag english articl type bfn exclus report no 1 51 of 30 decemb text thi parliament will be difficult to work with sai anatolii sobchak the mayor of st petersburg and a member of russia s new parliament anatolii sobchak is a lead polit figur in hi countri he mai be expect to run for presid in three year from now at least he ha said noth to rule out the possibl a petersburg base report for interfax ha approach sobchak with a few question on the outcom of the decemb 12 parliamentari elect anatolii sobchak i believ both russian and european polit leader must draw lesson from the result of the elect nation coupl with militar alwai equal fascism and nation root in the complic problem odf the russian arm forc and militari industri complex is rais head in russia todai thi come as no surpris now that nationalist tendenc ar grow in all the post communist countri the west ha even support and hail the bloom of nation in the baltic republ and ukrain becaus it produc the breakup of the soviet union now that the russian have respond with a nation of their own mani ar feel flabbergast i am convinc howev that the democrat forc will meet the outcom of the elect with seriou polit action that all the democrat forc will join hand becaus let me make it clear onc again russian nation in it present guis translat into fascism if do you feel the result of the parliamentari elect will move the russian govern to make seriou chang in it econom and foreign polici anatolii sobchak that wa a question you d better address to the presid and govern although i feel the govern can t help amend it polici it must among other thing concentr on a thought out foreign strategi which would take into consider the russian nation interest especi in relat with the former soviet republ prioriti must be chang in domest polici a new approach must be taken to relat with the constitu part of the feder and more attent must be paid to the russian interest although not at the expens of the right and interest of other peopl on the feder s territori if be a lawyer how do you feel about the possibl of opposit to the major in parliament anatolii sobchak the feder assembl ha neither major nor minor forc as yet the parliament is divid more or less accur into the democrat and those who mai eventu emerg as the opposit those who ar customarili describ as the independ make up approxim on third of the lawmak and have yet to defin their polit view besid all the parti and bloc have yet to matur into full size polit unit mani of them were found the last moment befor the elect and who can tell whether part of their repres won t decid to join other parti or bloc russia s new parliament is so far unpredicatbl it would be a mistak to sai out of hand that antidemocrat forc ar command a major in the new legislatur if on made that mistak those who have yet to defin their posit would be prompt to join that major so i see the need for seriou and veri flexibl tactic real parliamentar transit to normal profession parliamentari work will rid russian parliamentar of the infantil disord of the defunct suprem soviet the transit howev will take a lot of effort becaus most member of the feder assembl have no experi of law make thi will be sure to influenc veri serious the effect of their perform and their divis into parliamentari faction as well as the format of ad hoc coalit in other word i feel thi parliament will be veri difficult to work with it mai be expect to confront both the presid and govern with mani problem especi if neither bori yeltsin nor the nation cabinet draw lesson from the outcom of the recent held elect if russia s partner in europ have voic seriou concern about the outcom of the elect anatolii sobchak everyon is concern about the outcom of the russian elect europ even more so that russia the parti win the elect on parti ticket whose leader sai he is not go to think twice about put to us a few dozen nuclear devic just to make germani or ukrain or kazakhstan submit to russia vladimir zhirinovskii of the liber democrat parti if the european can t help take such statement close to heart now that thei especi germani have alreadi met with thi kind of leader mani rememb that no on in germani gave seriou thought to hitler s first call for expand eastward hitler wa made fun of he wa a laugh stock in germani with the result that europ and somewhat later the world as a whole were plung into the bloodiest of all war so the western concern about what is happen in russia is understand if the commiss of big europ could in all likelihood emerg as a mechan for fight thi threat anatolii sobchak there is no doubt of that as a veri strong mechan i would sai the commiss must plai a role in the effort to achiev polit uniti in europ and map out on blueprint and concert strategi for foght nation and fascism in russia and other countri of europ the problem of nation is press on everyon includ the untroubl belgium britain and spain it is

there ar draft quota if how mani boi appear unabl to meet your requir and drop out of your unit arkadii baskayev practic none these dai which doe not mean everyon cope those who fail to cope ar transfer to our logist unit if what about the offic or those who have come to serv under a contract arkadii baskayev unfortun we ar face even more problem with the offic than with the men under their command we ar lose a grow number of career servicemen ow to the shortag of hous facil and low payment what a commiss offic earn todai an averag of 120 000 roubl a month is no monei commerci structur

but ar begin to yield to pressur under the exist legal regul i have no right to reject a serviceman s request for the sever of hi contract as a result there s a shortag of compani and platoon command in the intern troop we ar serious worri about thi draft ar a success onli in the provinc unit of the intern troop in the provinc ar work under regular organiz chart those who have sign up to serv under a contract make up 96 percent of our regiment in the citi of briansk in moscow howev and other citi veri few men ar sign up to serv under a contract hous present a veri difficult problem if a short while ago the media accus you of resort to forc in the attempt to resolv thi problem a residenti project wa seiz arkadii baskayev the hous problem is on of the most press onli in moscow more

by veteran of the war in afghanistan the famili of offic who move into those flat us to live in emerg condit without heat and ga we had to posit our men around the hous becaus peopl who describ themselv as refuge start move in without ani legal reason for it we were allow in onli those who could prove their right to live in that hous i wa surpris and veri angri when sever mediaa edit start twist fact to accus the intern troop of the arbitrari arm seizur of hous facil repeat in full keep with law and in line with an appropri formal agreement we bought and ar protect hous facil for our homeless offic if you ar a career offic with a lengthi servic record even though the intern troop will not be act directli under the recent adopt militari doctrin what is your view of the doctrin arkadii baskayev in my view it leav much room for controversi on the on hand the russian arm forc ar adopt a total new strategi and on the other the troop ar unabl to meet their new object i think thought must be given to thi incident there is a clear cut strategi for the intern troop and prospect ar clear for their advanc instead of guard penitentiari the intern troop will be enegag primarili in oper assign onli polic forc will from now on be us as prison guard there will be no more soldier atop the penitentiari observ tower the intern troop ar to help the polic to enforc law and order especi in the area under a state of emerg sai ossetia and ingushetia russian republ where inter ethnic tension is run extrem high in the northern caucasu if and to act hand in hand with the polic to fight crime the elit brigad quarter in sofrino near moscow ha alreadi been commit to action in thi kind of oper in moscow i see the result as good if what exactli is the sofrino brigad arkadii baskayev it wa form in octob or novemb of 1988 it took part in the enforc of law and order in tbilisi and baku in 1989 by 1991 it had been engag in the effort to disengag the conflict parti in nagorni

plai in the octob develop in moscow as of date all it men ar stai in sofrino thei ar undergo combat and special train as well as men of ani other unit thei ar expect to know how to us differ kind of arm and thei mai be engag in street fight and will be expect to know how to us plastic shield and polic truncheon and thei mai be commit to action under emerg condit if back to the octob develop in moscow what lesson did you a command with a combat record draw from them arkadii baskayev the main lesson i am draw from them is thi all polit problem must be resolv by polit mean by wai of negoti without drag the militari includ the intern troop into attempt to settl differ as soon as the militari come to plai a role blood is shed on the other hand i am sure a civil war wa avert in octob if the confront had continu the countri woul ve split into two camp thank god that wa avert if wa there an altern to the militari action arkadii baskayev i don t think there wa procrastin would ve led to a civil war law and order forc were act without hesit as well as the intern troop thei abid by the law and in full recognit of realiti there wa no altern to what thei did on octob 3 and 4 if wa the us of tank fulli justifi arkadii baskayev in my view their experi and technic mean at their dispos enabl the intern troop to seiz control of build without the us of tank aleksandr rutskoi did not vote yurii ivanov the legal counsel of former russian vice presid aleksandr rutskoi relat to interfax exclus what hi client had to sai about the result of recent elect abov all rutskoi did not vote becaus he believ that a coup wa stage in the countri and the legal basi decre by yeltsin for the constitut reform wa a sham the report of hi vote were untru he also understand that the disband and shell of the countri s top legislatur and it defend brought about a hopeless situat which could onli be aggrav if there wa no parliament at all in rutskoi s view the elect result ar signific and instruct in hi view construct patriot forc must make certain conclus becaus the nearli 50 percent of the elig voter who did not go to the poll station lost faith in the abil of the present leader to chang the situat in the countri for the better seriou work is need with these russian and those who ar still naiv optimist about pseudo democrat and radic reform rutskoi appreci the posit of the voter who reject the bankrupt presidenti polici and those who grab power for the sole purpos of dismantl the countri and plung the russian peopl into mud the peopl saw through defend of the peopl such as russia s choic

FBIS3-61179: languag russian articl type cso articl by nikolai kishkin what to think about in the duma the first post soviet parliament will begin it work next week text the central elector commiss of russia ha final publish the final result of the elect behind us ar the tension and confus of the preelect week and the disson of the first frequent excess emot postelect assess it is alreadi possibl to take a calmer look at what ha happen and to think about what to expect from the new parliament and how it activ will be reflect in our life the first conclus to be drawn from look at the list of elect deputi is perhap simpl there were no winner in these elect no singl bloc and no singl parti receiv a major in parliament or even an appreci preponder the preelect predict of almost all of them were two to five time greater than what thei actual receiv perhap onli zhirinovskii s ldpr liber democrat parti of russia with all of it ambit wa not count on such an impress number of vote so the zhirinovskii phenomenon consist not in hi victori as it turn out in term of gener result he did not have on but in the unexpected of hi success right after the fact thi success wa explain by a multitud of factor includ extrem on from an affin for neo nazi slogan on the part of a low life and young supermen to mass hypnosi by the kashpirovskii method but the essenc probabl consist in the fact that while there wa no singl reason for the success of the ldpr final what wa decis wa the dissatisfact of a consider part of the popul with the current situat and their standard of live of cours question immedi aris why did thi voter give hi vote to zhirinovskii and not for exampl to travkin who with govorukhin s help wa critic the govern almost down to hi last word and in spite of thi bare pass the 5 percent mark why did thi voter not see the danger of the neo nazi slogan and recoil from their author why did he bui these promis which he knew could not be kept and the answer is simpl and obviou becaus sever gener of our peopl have been educ in a belief in simpl and clear solut and these ar what zhirinovskii offer after all did we not believ at the begin of almost ani five year plan that at the end of it there would be a burst of prosper were there not mani peopl who believ nikita sergeyevich when he said that commun would arriv in 20 year so why not believ vladimir volfovich now thank to the parti and the govern thi is not simpli a slogan of those year it is a level of belief in the idea that someon will give us someth it is the wai of think of the mass of peopl of cours on can sai that a certain part of the voter did not have enough polit sophist to figur all thi out ye on could sai that but it is wrong to blame the voter for thi for decad thei had no polit choic when thei went to vote and if now without get into the intricaci of polit a person ha made hi choic at the level of a naiv everydai awar it is hi choic and now the politician will have to deal with it the paradox of the recent elect consist in that while there ar no winner there ar still loser and unfortun thei ar the reform bloc if after count on a major in parliament thei do not receiv it you cannot call it anyth but a defeat and now all parliamentari tactic will have to be arrang in a new wai base on exist realiti how will the breakdown of polit forc in the duma look and how will the bloc behav let us stipul at the outset that a final conclus about the align of forc will not be possibl until after there have been two or three vote on fundament issu in the first place a consider share of the deputi were elect as independ thei ar not bound to ani bloc and therefor their propens mai be reveal onli dure the process of the parliament s work in the second place even those who ran under the banner of a specif bloc will certainli not necessarili vote on on question or anoth in line with thi bloc s program it is now possibl to construct supposit about the tactic of these bloc as a whole with a greater or lesser degre of probabl russia s choic accord to initi estim will be the largest faction includ more than 100 deputi which howev is clearli not enough to confid defend the cours of reform therefor thi cours can be maintain without special fluctuat onli with cooper with the yavlinskii shakhrai and women of russia bloc along with independ deputi the leader of the russia s choic bloc have alreadi announc their readi to interact in parliament with all polit forc but even then a major is not guarante in search of thi major the bloc will obvious be prepar to make partial concess except for those that would mean a reject of the reform that have been start and thi present a major difficulti for even the bloc of yavlinskii and shakhrai which ar kindr in spirit diverg from gaydar s bloc fundament with respect to a number of econom problem particularli concern the speed of the reform and social prioriti an extrem impress forc is repres by the team of the agrarian parti and the communist parti of the russian feder which togeth receiv more than 110 on can obvious argu about thi but i lump them togeth becaus to be honest i see no special differ in their polit posit their orient toward socialist valu bind them firmli togeth in their vote it is from thi team retain reformist phraseolog that there mai come propos that essenti exacerb inflat such as price regul support for fail enterpris in the citi and countri that is the veri propos that could mean an end to the reform and ukrainian of the russian economi the danger of such propos is fairli great if on consid that on the surfac thei appear to be concern for the public good and can attract a certain part of the deputi strang as it mai be with respect to a number of issu thi team might be join by the democrat parti of russia which is head by anticommunist travkin and govorukhin have assum dure the elect campaign a tone that wa not simpli critic but abus to the reform the govern and the presid these leader sharpli reduc the plai field in gener judg from the elect battl the impress wa creat that travkin s parti is not go to parliament to work but to fight unmask and brand peopl if thi tone is assum by the communist as well noth good await our parliament we will simpli get anoth copi of the suprem soviet and further heighten of the confront in societi and what about zhirinovskii s parti i shall allow myself to make the suggest that vladimir volfovich ha kept all hi ultranationalist slogan that shock russia and the world in reserv and will not us them in parliament he will save them for better time hope to gain all the power he will quit probabl regard the next two year as a campaign stretch over the time until the 1996 presidenti elect he will try to creat for himself the imag of the pike that live in the lake to keep the small fish alert from hi standpoint it is a win win situat if thing get better in the economi he will take credit for it he will sai look my parti came to offic and thing were straighten out if it becom harder to live again he ha a readi explan you did not allow me to creat a govern and thi is what you get although in hi heart i think that the last thing zhirinovskii would like would be to end up in govern becaus then he would have to be respons for everyth he promis incident he is not be offer a posit in the govern of cours that would be too much of a price to pai to see how a soap bubbl fill with empti promis might burst anoth scenario look surpris but it is worth mention the ldpr could end up as the least stabl parliamentari format dure the elect campaign zhirinovskii made on tactic error in respons to the question of how the deputi of hi parti would vote in the duma he said the wai their leader tell them to as long as vladimir volfovich wa plai the role of a steamship and pull sever dozen complet unknown politician into parliament he wa forgiven everyth but now look at the list of deputi of the ldpr you would think that thei would not be will to plai the role of extra while their leader is buck for presid a split in the parti ha alreadi been note zhirinovskii s former close alli and hi candid for vice presid a zavidii announc that he wa go to break with the boss stop financ him and lead hi peopl awai from him so the ldpr faction and it includ about 70 peopl with variou vote could have the most unexpect version of form a bloc and so the new parliament will begin it work in a coupl of dai what ar our hope and concern in thi connect we have but on hope and it is that from the first dai all the polit forc will reject confront and polit accus against on anoth and will understand that thi path ha alreadi been follow to the end and ha led to noth but troubl it ha led to bloodsh our hope is that the deputi have come to the duma to work and that mean abov all not to seek that which separ them but place where thei come togeth decis that ar mutual accept even if thei involv concess if thei approach thing reason thei must understand that there simpli is no other path with the current align of forc not onli no singl faction but not even ani conceiv combin of them can produc a major and thi mean that with ani other approach the parliament might not be abl to decid anyth at all and we ar alarm by the still remain possibl albeit theoret of reject the cours of reform with a subsequ collaps of the entir economi parliament could adopt some antireform law but it would be extrem difficult to do so in the first place ani draft law that in on wai or anoth affect expenditur from the feder budget mai be submit onli with a recommend from the govern so ani populist resolut to increas expenditur without actual cover them will be practic imposs to pass in the second place ani law adopt by the duma will have to be monitor by the council of the feder whose disapprov will have to be overcom not by a simpl major of duma vote but by two third in the third place the presid who even after the elect confirm the unchang cours of the reform still ha the right to a veto which also can be overridden onli by two third and propon of reform and those who support them do have a third of the vote in the duma true further advanc of the reform will requir new law that work in their direct which the deputi ar quit capabl of block propon of reform have onli on wai of prevent thi work constantli with the deputi especi the centrist part of them convinc them that thei ar right and with all the difficulti of the situat show unwav concern for the social direct of the reform it is assum that the feder assembl will begin it work with a joint session of the two chamber at which thei will hear the messag from the presid then thei will have to adopt their regul a draft of which ha been drawn up by the commiss on legisl propos and elect speaker and their deputi we ar no longer threaten by the return of a chief of all deputi like khasbulatov there will simpli be no such posit each chamber will have it own chairman whose role will be to conduct the meet and take charg of the daili routin and he will have no power over the parliamentari committe the speaker of the duma hi two deputi all three from differ faction and deleg from the faction and group with vote power in proport to their number will make up a confer for pure organiz busi determin the agenda conven extra session send draft law to committe etc the confer will make none of the decis the presidium of the suprem soviet essenti allow itself the question of the speaker of the duma ha alreadi been hotli discuss in the press even in spite of thi figur s obviou weak as compar to the recent past there ar mani in the run each faction would like to see it own repres mani well known politician would be will to occupi thi posit even if the speaker ha basic repres function thei allow him to be constantli in view which is of no small import for politician who ar work out far reach plan at variou time interest in thi post ha been express by s shakhrai and v zhirinovskii v lukin would not reject it and russia s choic would not be against recommend s kovalev it will not be possibl of cours to decid on a mutual accept candidaci at the session itself thi will be done through preliminari consult which ar proceed with difficulti so far it seem that none of the influenti faction will achiev success it will be necessari to agre on some neutral figur who ha not plainli announc hi polit sympathi we will not guess there is not long left to wait now the main thing is to get readi for product work so that parliamentar in russia will final acquir featur that ar attract to societi and will actual becom a real mean of creat a new russia

about keep peopl in order but hopefulli if you set up the right cooper atmospher you don t need to do too much of that but eventu you might have to do that you also in a wai give leadership to parliament in term of the staff the support all of that fall within the offic of the speaker but i don t know what els becaus i ve just it s not even a few hour i m learn what els is involv mashokw we re told you ar the first ladi to be speaker in the world ginwala no in south africa there ar speaker in the british parliament i think austria a number of other countri not mani but there ar some mashokw okai for south africa it s an import occas though what exactli do you think will be your problem presid over thi parliament of differ background anc nation parti np and anybodi els ginwala i think that paus let me put it as a challeng rather than a problem becaus i hope it s not go to be a problem i think the challeng is go to be to bring into parliament a democrat tradit now peopl sai but sure that s automat it s not parliament can be in mani posit it is simpli a rubber stamp the cabinet decid and parliamentarian debat and approv legisl i think we need to bring into parliament it must own becaus it is the and thi is what i said when i accept that it is the repositori of the principl and the valu for which peopl have struggl which have actual driven the kind of chang we ve got sentenc as heard the natur home for that is in a parliament so if we see parliament in that wai then member of parliament have got to be creativ thei ve got to drive the chang that still lie ahead it doesn t mean that thei re act contrari to cabinet but it doe mean a more equal relationship move in tandem each contribut so that we speed up the process of chang but even after that it ha to be the repositori of democraci mashokw look at a polit background ar you go to be fair with the ifp inkatha freedom parti and the np with the anc background that we know you re from ginwala i don t think my problem is fair to be veri honest at a person level i ve been involv in polit becaus you re involv in polit it doesn t mean you re involv in adversari polit it doesn t mean my belief in what the anc stand for have chang but it doe mean that a speaker believ in democraci parliament ha got to hear everi voic thi is again what i said todai it s veri veri import becaus you don t serv democraci by stifl debat so you have to encourag debat then the composit of the hous is not determin by the speaker it s determin by the peopl of thi countri and then thei can make the decis of what is the outcom of the debat but while the debat prevail everi voic must be allow it fullest sai mashokw i m try to understand that allow it fullest sai is there no temptat would there be no temptat on your part to stifl other voic that ar not in your camp as it were ginwala well in term of my person record that would not be a problem i think like everybodi you sometim get annoi with someon and sai oh what ar thei go on about i think obvious as speaker you can t show that but that is on thing but to stifl and to prevent it goe contrari to everyth i person have want so it s veri difficult to sai what the futur hold and i ve been in thi job just a few hour but it would be veri wrong to stifl ani debat the hous itself regul itself in mani wai it set rule it set time schedul as speaker my job will be to make sure that there s a fair that peopl who want to speak out ask but within rule within procedur that everybodi ha agre sentenc as heard that s the process we have to take forward mashokw i have to ask you thi question now you re go to be presid over a predominantli male ginwala interrupt much less so lesli than it wa two dai ago mashokw ha it chang ginwala significantli look at it i don t know the number of women but when you look at the composit of thi parliament and it s not just women sentenc as heard i wa sit where i could see them as thei were be sworn in and thi parliament repres south africa there ar men and women there ar peopl of all religion polit persuas there ar worker there ar capitalist you ve got them all that is what it s all about and it s realli marvel mashokw doe it make it more easi for you if you have more women in it as oppos to presid over a male domin parliament ginwala it make me feel more comfort it make me feel we re reach the point we need to reach becaus it will be more democrat becaus women s experi will feed into the debat so that when we ar talk about law we will not paus the live of half the popul in the previou parliament were probabl more becaus black were also exclud sentenc as heard but in term of the male domin the experi of women will feed into the debat so that mashokw interrupt but don t domin parliament we re have all thi liber of women ginwala interrupt why should that be suddenli domin i mean after all women ar the major in thi countri and we re not nowher near the major in thi parliament but you might argu i mean that by their own contribut thei might domin i think everi member s own contribut will determin the extent to which thei ar abl to shape thing mashokw you have a background of media work in the media how is thi go to chang now that you ar ladi speaker ginwala well i don t know whether the background is go to have anyth to do with it but my polit background lead me to believ that parliament ha to be open peopl have got to see what goe on in parliament and i hope therefor that the media will actual cover parliament but i hope also that the media will explain parliament becaus there is a lot of ritual in parliament which you won t alwai get rid of what is the differ between a bill and an act media in mani wai ha to explain that we will be talk of select committe what ar those so the media have a vital role to plai in explain parliament but from parliament s point of view from the need of democraci we need peopl to feel thi is their hous we need member of parliament to be awar that all of south africa know what thei ar do and thei ar sai and we need the public to know that thei have a right to make an input into that parliament we ve got to find wai of do that mashokw were you surpris at your appoint and ar you readi for it ginwala no i m not readi for it i wa surpris i wa honor i felt veri proud rather intimid i m afraid regret that i will not be that activ in polit a certain

career of ani kind politkovskaya but you ar alreadi on top lakhova where is on top i wa in the suprem soviet and now i am in the duma both of them in my opinion ar at the same level i wa an advis to the presid i enter the last elect so that the experi i had gain as an advis to bori nikolayevich regard question of famili matern and childhood could be appli in the new polit women s movement of cours when i came to the suprem soviet my polit life wa no longer develop randomli when i gave my consent to becom an advis to the presid that wa a thoroughli consid decis to me it wa import for the

opposit could work more construct and not be in opposit all the time it seem to me that it is veri import that we women have appear in parliament and ar try to provid a peac make buffer and we think that we have succeed in do thi to a certain degre dure the past three month politkovskaya do you think that perhap a woman will becom presid of russia in the next few year someon like you for exampl lakhova in the next few year i do not think so we must see how prepar our societi is although we were well support in the last elect thi wa larg an advanc perhap everyon would like to be a napoleon

the peopl give the correspond assess then it would be possibl at on time thei gave bori nikolayevich the benefit of the doubt after all he did not start at the top moreov while in the scandinavian countri there ar women presid and in turkei and pakistan there ar women prime minist i do not think our russian women ar ani wors perhap our first woman presid of russia is grow up somewher right now politkovskaya could such a woman as irina khakamada be presid or prime minist lakhova while i have sympathi for irina i do not think that she could aspir to thi role in my opinion she is afraid of women and is not awar of pure women s problem i see that she is even commun with men more and more in parliament the idea she is put forth now is a veri danger on that greatli disturb women s organ thi is the idea of adopt a law that would allow women with children under six year of ag to stai at home and receiv wage for thi i am convinc that thi would lead to dire consequ the network of preschool institut would fall apart and women s employ to which european women ar strive so hard would declin and not everi woman todai can sit at home 14 percent of us ar singl women with children how would thei manag thi on the small wage that would be given for a child that is simpli absurd it is imposs not to think that to sit at home for six hour a dai would automat mean to lose your skill i have spoken about thi with irina and she understand everyth and even the fact that the duma might veri well not adopt such a law but even the failur to adopt it would be advantag for irina and it seem to me that it is wrong to creat your own imag thi wai we must realli understand women s problem todai politkovskaya in your view what ar russian women suffer from most todai lakhova how can i answer thi ye everyth is absolut a burden on them todai regardless of which problem you take thei ar suffer everywher there is obviou discrimin against women even in polit there when decis ar made we women ar practic not repres thi is shown by the composit of todai s govern which includ onli ella pamfilova and she is no longer there at recent parliamentari hear on the budget professor of econom oksana dmitriyeva from moscow a deputi from the yabloko faction spoke simpli a geniu to put it crude she is head and shoulder abov all of our men how she understand the budget how remark she think i said even though she is not in our faction we will nomin oksana dmitriyeva as a candid to the post of minist of financ of the russian feder if we had manag to get women in the place where decis ar made even 30 percent these decis would probabl be more harmoni as for parliament were it not for our women s movement women of russia onli five percent would be women and we immedi made it 11 3 percent if you take the local level the situat is altogeth differ we were just recent in novosibirsk omsk and tomsk where elect to oblast duma were held and there is simpli not a singl woman in them everyon know that 75 percent of the unemploi in russia ar women but thi doe not chang anyth women and men have complet differ right when it come to hire and fire if a woman is hire the first thing thei ask is her ag and the second thing how mani children and how old thei ar men ar never ask these question thei ar evalu onli accord to their profession qualiti the union of woman of russia went with legal expert to the judici chamber for control of the mass media under the presid and thi is the first presid to have them reprimand mani newspap for the fact that their advertis of work is discriminatori toward women for exampl we invit everyon except women to work or we invit women without children to work take for exampl even the function to which thei like to assign us women famili childbirth and educ todai a woman cannot even normal exercis her ag old reproduct right becaus the death rate of children and mother is veri high and in term of abort we occupi second place in the world after romania for everi birth we have 2 5 abort is thi not a problem but our men todai do not think there is ani need to do anyth about the abort problem at all thei continu to think that thi is pure a woman s problem and not a state problem politkovskaya in what countri would you person like to be a woman lakhova i have not visit mani of them but from all the document we receiv from the un women ar in the best posit in the scandinavian countri their social statu is veri high there in the parliament of finland about 40 percent ar women ar thei realli ani wors off in finland becaus of thi but i person like live in russia i would like veri much for our women to be awar that we too can do someth to understand that even what we did befor the elect we creat a preced for the polit movement

given a modern social democraci a normal parliamentari life excerpt human right an end of centuri religion pavelescu mr presid do you believ that the world should know more about on of the most import peopl in the leadership of thi countri nastas to tell you the truth for quit some time now i have not been approach with such question as what have you done in the past four year still if you wish to know more about me i am readi to tell you i wa born in bucharest on 22 june 1950 under the sign of cancer a terribl sign for those who choos polit for their field of activ passag omit pavelescu now i will approach you in your capac as presid of the pdsr social democraci parti of romania recent you have embark fulli on the activ of organ thi polit format you have paid visit in provinc and attend symposium all thi lead to the impend question peopl said of your parti that it wa establish instantan around the presid of romania ion iliescu whose immens prestig permit the parti to achiev stabil veri quickli on a somehow sentiment basi what is left of the initi feel and what ar the current goal nastas certainli there is still immens sympathi for mr ion iliescu who ha assum the respons to pull romania out of the crisi and certain peopl not abl to discredit him resort to the uncivil mean of insult onli a person who possess such qualiti as the head of our state democrat through hi entir structur toler and conciliatori can continu untouch by these ignobl attack but sinc you have refer to the parti and it destini i will give you a frank answer no polit format can surviv if it doe not construct it structur and activ on modern base after the decemb 1989 revolut some associ were set up that were mostli against rather than in favor of someth the fsn nation salvat front itself wa against the past super central dictatorship in the economi suffoc in polit like a hous that ha not been air for a long time and which the rejuven flow of life ha not penetr the civic allianc wa establish in the same wai thi is to give you just two exampl all these structur can no longer resist the new condit as far as we ar concern the chang of name that took place at our parti s last congress from fdsn democrat nation salvat front into pdsr social democraci parti of romania wa not onli a formal modif but it wa conceiv as a fundament chang in our wai of think and in our action we wish to establish an intellig parti that ha it own messag to promot we have an econom concept that is capabl of inspir dynam and effici in our societi pavelescu now we ar go to talk about a sensit area name about idea on what doctrin do you base your activ nastas it is definit the modern social democrat doctrin that so mani social democrat parti in europ and in the world follow it ha been emphat state that social democraci doe not have it own concept in the econom area thi is a complet fals idea in europ at least social democraci ha form it own school of manag and ha expert capabl of confer dynam to econom life and inspir the motiv forc that is necessari in our centuri on should not assign a pure social compon to social democraci thi would look as if in the same societi there were two model of societi on for product and anoth on for distribut of product thi could be compar to a car with two engin and two steer wheel thi is absurd we have on singl concept which we could call an integr on which is capabl of incorpor the econom manageri and social human progress in on and the same vision in fact we defin more precis the relationship between individu and the product sphere likewis we have an individu concept about econom area or sector and about the area of product and servic the wai in which we regard thing allow us to introduc new individu element in our social econom life and not element borrow from abroad passag omit pavelescu thu could we assum that the pdsr view itself as a parti which through it program and it activ constantli wish to ensur the econom and social modern of the countri in order to elimin the remnant of the excess central of the past and to creat new sourc of dynam in both area nastas thi could be a good definit for a continu chang realiti pavelescu but what ar we go to do about those who disput all thi thei continu to accus you of everi possibl sin or charg you with the most extravag intent nastas we have live too long in the atmospher of clash between social and capit thu we got us to answer question about the futur onli with term creat in thi confront but thi seem to me to be a simplist and incorrect attitud social ha an emot impact on fewer and fewer peopl on the other hand capit still seem to us permeat with too mani neg connot at the polit and social level for it to repres the miracul kei or the magic word with a strong magnet forc through our ideolog we have found solut for the better organ of relat between individu and societi thi is the essenc of our concept how do we regard thi relationship we cannot formul it correctli without also refer to the role of the state we believ that at least for the transit period the state ha an import role to plai we cannot pretend that all that is happen in the area of product relat doe not concern us pavelescu at a symposium organ at poiana brasov mr mircea cosea chairman of the council for coordin strategi and econom reform made a speech in which he drew attent to the fact that the concept of the market economi must be appli in such a wai that the ordinari individu should regard it as a necess wa he speak on behalf of the pdsr nastas thi is a rhetor question certainli mr cosea includ in hi idea the parti whose member he is at the same time refer to the market economi as if we had a choic is wrong the market economi ha been implement all around us we cannot stai isol it would be as if we were to choos anoth rail gaug for our engin thi is inconceiv the problem howev is that we should work in a wai that could make peopl perceiv other effect not onli the neg effect of thi economi such as the increas of price inflat and unemploy optim condit for competit for contest pavelescu do you have a solut nastas there ar solut i wa not the on who invent them optim condit must be creat for econom competit we should elimin monopoli that gener high and disproportion price bureaucraci and corrupt howev we can see a viciou circl here we need restructur and financi sourc to permit the develop of industri and thei in turn can establish the framework for the oper of the law of competit thi is our understand of the wai in which we can emerg from the current impass and we have to do it alon nobodi will work for us passag omit pavelescu mr presid how do you explain that while you remain a parti that is close connect with the 1989 decemb revolut thu not mark by the defect of the past your influenc in univers is still poor nastas there is a veri simpl explan for thi certain univers teacher who were also part of the old structur have repaint their past have bluf and continu to bluff and attract student thi situat is anomal student all over the world ar basic left orient onli in our countri have the student opinion deviat pavelescu and god forbid that a basic right wing concept should penetr the student world nastas you ar right we ar try to get closer to thi section basic their interest ar close connect with those that we ar fight for we ar go to establish a youth forum the univers group will plai an import role in thi forum pavelescu consid that your is such a young parti you have not had time to take care of other import social strata of the elector why for exampl should so mani women vote for the pd fsn democrat parti nation salvat front when as a matter of fact that parti ha brought them onli disappoint nastas i believ that in principl our viewpoint come quit close we intend to organ a pdsr women s associ in gener term due to past frustrat and due to our neglig i have to be frank here the proport of women in the structur of our leadership is insignific by all mean we will correct thi mistak and you will see that the number of women readi to join us will increas the dai when peopl vote on the basi of feel ar gone thi is certain pavelescu what type of organiz formula have you adopt nastas those that ar includ in our statut local organ coordin council the execut bureau and the stand deleg we continu follow aspect that ar gradual becom our distinct featur represent and democraci the pdsr ha becom and will remain a polit forc pavelescu therefor can on sai that the pdsr ha becom a power forc nastas on can sai that why not and it will continu to grow stronger we need a few month to organ our strategi we will increas our activ in the provinc in the come period mr oliviu gherman pdsr presid and other member of the parti leadership will particip in activ that ar aim at enhanc the organ of our branch in the provinc will hold theoret debat with a practic charact and will dissemin our precis messag pavelescu thu those who consid the pdsr a parti of pedant ar mistaken nastas thei ar utterli mistaken we ar a milit parti if thi characterist doe not take concret shape in what mihai eminescu romanian poet call ugli street scene it is becaus we detest the idea of turn the street into a place where polit disput ar solv howev those who mistak our good manner for weak ar wrong what is new and noteworthi in our activ is the combin of joint action with the particip of parti cadr and consid that we ar the rule parti with the member of the execut thi fact is benefici for two reason the fsn made a mistak in leav the govern in charg of dialogu on all issu after the mai 1990 elect the parti felt in a wai neglect we wish to make good thi error therefor we approach the local parti organ with group of peopl that includ both member of the parti and of the execut the govern member can onli gain from see everyth on the spot the member of the parti leadership can also onli gain when thei take over a part of the respons pavelescu a modern parti with a clear messag and with viabl structur thu a parti that is constantli increas it mobil forc is thi the wai you want to appear in the ey of the public nastas thi is more or less what we ar and thi is definit what we want to becom we try to find wai for cooper with all polit forc in the parliament pavelescu i am go to approach you now in your capac as presid of the chamber of deputi of the romanian parliament is it onli our impress or ar you realli annoi with the chamber nastas annoi might be a littl too strong an express dissatisfi ye and i have reason to be an atmospher that is at varianc with the rule for a proper function of such an institut ha been establish in the chamber of deputi there ar deputi who ar absent without ani reason other ask their friend to sign the attend book for them therefor often we do not have the necessari number of deputi to adopt certain law howev i have to tell you someth els if you ask ani presid of a chamber of deputi you will see that thei have the same reason for discont a parliament often look like an undisciplin structur a machin that is work to no avail howev a veri import aspect can be overlook we at the level of parliament absorb a great amount of tension which would otherwis overflow the street with consequ that would be difficult to estim pavelescu i am not conceal the impress that a part of the public perceiv thing a littl differ the impress exist that we ar wit two type of blockag an econom and a legisl blockag which fuel each other what is your view on thi issu nastas thi is an exagger you should not forget that the parliament is also a sort of mirror of the nation s wish it symbol if the nation had want a parliament in which the pdsr held 51 percent of the deputi and senat the nation would have act accordingli but the nation chose the current situat and we have to respect it will passag omit pavelescu you have initi a dialogu in which willingli or unwillingli virtual all polit forc repres the parliamentari spectrum particip ar you pleas with it nastas do you want a sincer answer we believ that it wa a good idea as a matter of fact dialogu should becom a regular compon of the public life in romania it is sad that some peopl consid it as an except case we tri to carri out a certain inter parti exercis of democraci becaus apart from our option we ar also duti bound to cooper in order to reach our well defin goal and stop what us to be call the cold war after the elect pavelescu have you had ani result so far nastas i believ so for exampl we succe in chang at least our wai of approach other therefor when mr dinu patriciu promin leader of the liber parti 93 so rude attack the entir pdsr it wa easi for us to isol him to turn it into an exampl and not a rule and pleas note that we have not identifi for a moment the whole liber parti 93 with the respect deputi in ani event we will not hold talk with him befor he apolog howev the dialogu had except result from anoth aspect it chang the imag of the pdsr the parti that ha been label in everi possibl wai ha prove that it ha been accept inde thu the effort wa worthwhil pavelescu the democrat convent of romania cdr accus you of prepar for earli elect to what extent is thi affirm true or fals nastas certain parti for exampl the pd fsn have publicli announc their intent to induc earli elect other parti includ the cdr ar prepar for those elect although thei ar apprehens about the futur in these condit we would be naiv just to stand asid and wait as we have declar we consid thi solut of earli elect as the worst and the most uninspir on it would block us for a while without offer anyth to anybodi in exchang howev if we ar face with such an altern we will act accordingli nevertheless i believ that the posit we express publicli wa not properli understood pavelescu what ar you refer to nastas i am refer to the need that befor earli gener elect earli local elect should be organ i am sai thi becaus a somewhat paradox situat ha been creat at the last local elect we were not a parti therefor among the leader of counti and of bucharest sector mani peopl who ar member of the democrat convent or member of the pd fsn were elect it is clear that earli gener elect will be organ with the same compet idea thu the result can alreadi be anticip therefor we ar go to propos a modif of the law on public administr and the elector law so that our represent correspond to the proport of the elector that vote for us ani form of action aim at undermin thi procedur will be interpret onli as a measur of arrog egoism just to quot roman pd fsn leader pavelescu mr presid sinc you have been so patient with us we cannot resist the temptat to ask you a question that will probabl seem to you inappropri do you believ that the udmr democrat union of hungarian in romania ha commit itself to obstruct the leadership forev nastas i am go to answer you truthfulli recent in cluj i address thi format and ask them to show a more reason attitud well let me tell you that i receiv a number of posit sign thi mean that your question wa not exactli inappropri

not prove easi to take the issu beyond the point of token good intent by themselv ar fail to produc result and women in senior manag job remain a rariti on occas a mirag of equal appear partli becaus

district also follow citi limit close anoth requir of the initi although speier and eastin have district that cross counti line the other district brown mention which is held by gwen moor of lo angel follow citi boundari but probabl doe not meet the compact test but with onli minor chang it could meet both standard the problem for the democrat is that mani of those district alreadi ar in jeopardi

francisco district ha lost popul rel to the rest of the state sinc everi district must contain roughli the same number of peopl after redistrict the boundari for brown s district probabl will be forc

huen and other sai that partisanship is the real motiv behind brown s opposit proposit 119 might threaten the democrat hold on the assembl where thei control 47 of 80 seat and in the senat where thei have 25 of 40 seat inde on of the more controversi provis contain in both initi is a requir that as mani district as possibl be competit defin as contain democrat and republican in proport that ar within 2 of the parti statewid share of regist voter sinc democrat current have the edg 50 to 39 thi requir might appear harmless but republican histor have been abl to win almost ani district in which democrat account for fewer than 50 of the regist voter thi is becaus democrat tend to be poorer and thei move more often than republican and so each district actual ha fewer democrat voter than the registr roll suggest if you want to penal the democrat for repres poor peopl thi is the wai to do it bruce cain a univers of california professor and democrat consult said of the criteria in
