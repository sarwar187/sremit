patriot text die zeit mr rau mani year ago you talk about conduct an elect campaign under the slogan reconcili instead of divis in the meantim germani ha been reunifi but intern it is more divid than befor how can thi divid between east and west be overcom rau the situat is the same as it wa in 1949 when we place materi reconstruct ahead of deal with the past we ar now in danger of view unif as noth more than the rebuild of the eastern laender by wai of introduc free market econom while too littl is be done to enabl us to understand on anoth peopl have to talk to each other we have an oblig to tell each other about our differ live we also need to forg a whole seri of relat die zeit for exampl rau on can rebuild the church of our ladi in dresden and on can visit the concentr camp at oranienburg place that lead us back to our common histori in both it good and it bad aspect die zeit you have recent been critic as someon who person reject unif follow the collaps of the wall the govern of your land in which bonn is situat wa oppos to the move to berlin ar or were the conserv the better patriot rau i never reject reunif it wa alwai even if i consid the word inappropri becaus of the first syllabl which sound too mechan and smack of restor my polit goal incident i first becam involv in polit through the issu of uniti with the foundat of the all german peopl s parti in 1952 howev like all other politician i did not envisag such a develop in the forese futur howev that is also true of the chancellor the foreign minist and almost everybodi els as far as berlin is concern in 1991 i express support for the parliament and govern remain in bonn but befor the decis wa made i said that whatev decis is adopt it should be loyal implement i have maintain that the first section of the motion that i back in the bundestag on 20 june 1991 state the seat of feder presid is in berlin i do inde believ that the role of feder presid can best be perform in berlin die zeit the stasi file ar a sourc of discord in the countri is it not time that thei were close and the matter put asid rau sometim on want to sai what the chancellor said spontan close the file howev i can see that such an approach will not work it will not work becaus of the victim who have a right to see that the peopl who commit crime against them ar punish i sometim becom concern onli about the wai in which we german go about all of thi die zeit german ar wealthi but thei ar not necessarili econom success anymor what must happen for the economi and societi to onc again achiev an extern and intern balanc rau mani peopl ar rich but poverti is grow i think that the current discuss about germani as a center for busi doe not go far enough the issu that ar be argu ar cost factor and the durat of permit procedur that is not enough i believ that we must concentr more on technolog advanc as well as new product rather than the export of establish good die zeit technolog renew doe that not encount great obstacl in germani with respect to genet engin or other futur orient technolog rau our postwar histori ha been mark by a pendulum like movement between euphoria over technolog and fear of technolog thi cannot be rectifi by speed up the movement of the pendulum onli by seek a balanc that mean that on must increas the opportun for research in the case of genet engin and other appropri scientif disciplin howev on must also set limit in my opinion interfer with human embryo should not be permit as far as i am concern there ar no rel boundari onli absolut on die zeit in difficult time for the economi how can on achiev both higher perform in the context of intern competit too and greater solidar is our societi not too egoist rau the past few decad have wit a process of individu that also contain element undermin a feel of solidar there is a form of person develop that is so absolut that it rule out ani form of refer to solidar or love of on s fellow man the danger thing is alwai to demand solidar from those who need it and not from those who must be readi to displai such feel i do not like the kind of discuss in which the factori director sai we must tighten our belt which mean lower wage but for those who receiv their wage from the factori director and not for factori director themselv by sai that i do not want to conduct ani kind of outmod class war but i do believ that thi ha someth to do with the exampl set by those who ar model and creat model in thi societi die zeit the polit class ha fallen into disreput the current presid richard von weizsaeck ha given the parti a piec of hi mind what must chang for you not to find yourself scold the parti on of these dai rau there ar mani thing about the presid s diagnos that i consid correct and it also somewhat hurt me that i had to contradict him i could understand part of the critic but it wa also polem and i also believ that what we need wa more encourag for polit rather than polem direct against parti we ar wit a develop that see fewer peopl becom involv in polit becaus thei ar concern that thei will be place on the same level as bad exampl and will onli be consid to be peopl who can do noth other than destroi their polit oppon the result is that polit sever lack an up and come gener die zeit what can parti themselv do to becom more respons to those who ar commit to issu and to problem rau the parti still do not have an adequ answer the commit that is there is bypass the parti the church die zeit and the union rau and the union that is why i believ that we ar deal with an institut crisi for which i have no simpl solut but which i think must be overcom i still sai that we have a wonder hous a fine brick build but the mortar is begin to crumbl the institut no longer keep peopl togeth howev we cannot chang peopl so that thei fit into our organ we must chang our organ so that peopl want to join die zeit germani s posit ha chang sinc reunif should the frg be a normal countri that present itself in the wai that it neighbor in the eu and unit nation expect or should the german choos a special cours becaus thei have better moral and a better understand of histori rau i do not think that the german should pursu a special cours and i do not think that it would be right for the german to do so howev it seem to me to be right and import that the german be particularli consciou of their histori and draw lesson from it we german must make it perfectli clear that what we want is a european germani not a german europ we do not want our feel of nation ident to be a product for export we need to be a part of europ becaus if such a larg countri in the center of europ is not it will be view as a threat by other and might inde turn out that wai i would consid that to be a disast as far as germani s histori thi centuri is concern i believ in what gustav heinemann said there is onli a chanc of other forget what happen becaus of germani if we do not forget what happen die zeit what doe that mean in the context of the anniversari that will be celebr thi year and next year in normandi the end of the war how should we approach those date rau befor that we have a kei date that concern onli us and i believ that it will be a move dai i mean the 20th of juli the 50th anniversari of the stauffenberg s attempt on hitler s life i think that it would be a good thing if thi anniversari were not onli an occas for discuss the men and women of 20 juli but also for discuss the histori of resist in gener we have our own date for exampl 8 mai of next year 50 year sinc the end of the war it must be clear to us that it is the dai of liber and a dai of defeat for germani that it wa not a catastroph the befel us from without but wa the consequ of a disast that we ourselv set in motion die zeit what conclus ar to be drawn from german histori should we keep out of everi conflict or should we becaus of histor experi be particularli activ in intern polit and shoulder respons rau undoubtedli the latter i would onli sai that the question of whether particularli activ is onli respons when german soldier ar involv ha been put to me too quickli i do not think that on should think of soldier as soon as on think of intern assist especi as on know that most militari conflict have social or ecolog caus i think that the idea of a european peac corp that is avail for peac mission should be reviv die zeit would that have help in the case of yugoslavia the spd social democrat parti of germani approach the constitut court in karlsruh in connect with sever specif question but befor the deliber in karlsruh it had approv militari oper in former yugoslavia in the bundestag how can those two thing be reconcil rau the approach to karlsruh wa about clarif of our constitut and not that we were of the opinion that karlsruh could or had to prohibit or facilit certain step we went to karlsruh becaus we consid the chancellor s statement that such mission were not possibl unless the constitut wa amend to be correct we realli want to know that and when the constitut ha been amend we want to make polit decis on a case by case basi die zeit if the bundeswehr becom more intens involv abroad in un mission there will be casualti can you envis mission for which german soldier should die rau i cannot view the matter so casual becaus without blood be shed by american englishmen and frenchmen as well as russian in our case there would have been no liber from nation social despit my previou reserv about the rearmament of germani that is why i said ye to nation defens as we express it in bad godesberg in 1959 howev i want to exhaust all wai and mean involv in nation defens unless the intern commun see no other option and demand that we make a contribut to peacekeep what i do not want is for us to becom a kind of rapid deploy forc that is dispatch wherev there is a crisi die zeit for decad a featur of the discuss about polici on europ in thi countri ha been harmoni but now it is the subject of disagr how can on continu to advoc european integr and more involv in europ rau there can be no intern calm in europ if a peopl that is 80 million strong live in the center of europ and surround by neighbor is not integr in the process of european unif i can understand why mani peopl view the commun as strongli orient toward agricultur as be a subsidi machin i can understand that german steelwork ar skeptic about europ becaus the polici on steel is wrong i can also understand that mani ar oppos to excess bureaucraci and excess regul becaus there is no adequ democrat control system to counterbal that that more and more guidelin ar initi approv by nation govern guidelin that cannot be overseen in that respect i agre with stoiber s critic but i do not want to have anyth at all to do with the basi for hi critic die zeit is it true that helmut kohl is the last german statesman who is firmli commit to germani s integr with europ rau i wa just about to sai that if i were presid there would be two of us at least two of us die zeit the republ ha to deal with right wing extrem not for the first time but it ha never had to do so intens befor there ar the right wing terrorist and right wing parti what should be done should the republikan be kept under surveil or should the parti be ban rau i believ that the weimar republ did not collaps becaus there were too mani extremist but becaus there were too few democrat that is why i am in favor of a polit debat which must of cours take into account it effect i am not in favor of hold a discuss with schoenhub on televis and i think it is wrong for us to be taken in by provoc stage for the media we have conduct research in those area where the republikan have obtain a high number of vote and we have come to the conclus that the area ar consist troubl spot alwai town and neighborhood where the prospect for young peopl ar particularli bad becaus there ar few occup train posit few job few meet place we must pai more attent to the reason peopl ar drawn to extrem and try to remov the caus die zeit so that mean that right wing voter ar not so much the result of mr schoenhub s activ as societi s indiffer rau that is correct that is true of a great mani voter everywher there ar peopl who cannot be taught anyth there ar such peopl in franc in itali and in germani howev we as german know best or we should know best of all what the result of such view be held by a major of peopl can be that is also why we have to react in a particularli sensit manner we do not have more extrem than in other countri but we need to have a higher threshold becaus onc bitten twice shy die zeit if that is the case then why ar we readi to introduc new nation partli nationalist sentiment into polit rau there is no place for nationalist sentiment howev i conced that in view of the ruptur in our histori i consid a natur relationship to on s countri to be necessari we should not leav that to the extremist what i sai is that a patriot is someon who love hi fatherland wherea a nationalist is someon who despis other peopl fatherland i want to be a good patriot die zeit what can a presid do in thi situat in thi difficult fatherland to quot your polit mentor gustav heinemann ha richard von weizsaeck s presid not shown that regardless of how much of an effort he make the presid cannot influenc the cours of polit but can onli accompani it symbol rau i think that richard von weizsack ha accomplish much more than that the speech that he deliv on 8 mai 1985 in itself justifi the 10 year in offic it wa the kind of speech heard onc in a centuri on can hardli overestim the effect that the speech had all over the world in clearli show germani to be a democraci at least half of a presid s role is connect with foreign polici he is to a certain extent the first ambassador and that appli not onli to travel with which i would be spare howev i believ that the wai in which on visit foreign countri and the experi that on introduc into polit talk can be more than a symbol accompani die zeit can the presid be someon who make peopl think about their live rau no he cannot and should not act that wai not even as a constitut organ howev in the wai in which he pose question and the wai in which he bring peopl togeth he can be to point to area where mean is lack in life and make peopl think that wai i believ that it is desir for the presid to have a clear cut imag but it should alwai be an invit to other to show where thei stand die zeit which countri would you visit first if as presid you were free to decid that rau i would be drawn to israel but perhap i would go to the netherland to our neighbor which ha problem with us then of cours talk with our neighbor in the east would be import for me die zeit everi presid ha sought a role for himself and the question that aris everi time is how polit can a head of state be how would you answer that question in relat to yourself is it not the case that a politician sometim ha to caus divis or a polar to set thing in motion rau he must also be abl to focu on minor posit know that thei ar minor posit if he think it is us to make them major posit then he can seek support for them die zeit mr rau it now seem unlik that you could be elect with the vote of the spd alon how do you want to win vote from the liber and the green rau my candidaci is an offer address to all democrat parti i know from mani talk i have had that there is a lot of support for my candidaci in other democrat parti i hope that it will be translat into vote

absenc of an immigr law becaus the countri ha no immigr polici everybodi is allow to enter but those who manag to remain in germani do so overwhelmingli as foreign thei have no easi access to

about 6 2m foreign live in germani of that number 1 5m or about 25 per cent ar under the ag of 18 two third of these children of foreign have been born here yet most of them do not have german

or she is fulli naturalis throughout thi time these peopl cannot vote even though thei pai tax thei have no right thi ha got to chang she sai schmaltz jacobsen explain how the german law on citizenship is bound up with the old imperi decre of 1913 articl 5 7 of the reich und staatangehorigkeitsgesetz or imperi and state citizenship law state quit unambigu through birth on can acquir german citizenship if the legitim child ha a german parent and if an illegitim child ha a german mother she add thi mean that the 6 2m foreign in germani have littl chanc of obtain german citizenship

other germani s citizenship law is a bit like that you have german blood or you have not resist to amend the law even by allow dual citizenship a move which schmalz jacobsen is spearhead come from the bavarian base christian social union the sister parti of the christian democrat union even though iron bavaria ha on of the most liber constitut of all the german state csu offici fear easier access to citizenship would somehow dilut the german ident thi obsess with what make up a real german is difficult to explain sai schmalz jacobsen take my case now that i have thi job i have becom the

letter from german who want to support me in my attempt to chang the law and who want to integr the foreign live in our countri yet howev much there is a gradual consensu emerg at least among the fdp
