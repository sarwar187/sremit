the statement daili valu not establish thi action is a logic outgrowth of the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement becaus that propos put into issu the question of whether the list of nutrient that fda propos be includ in the nutrit label under 101 36 wa the appropri list the comment have persuad fda that the list need to be expand in the manner describ in thi final rule fda is not persuad howev that other trace element for which the na ha not establish rda or esaddi should be declar within the nutrit label the comment that suggest that such element be includ on the label provid some publish report that certain of these element have been found to be essenti in the diet of variou anim but did not provid suffici evid for the agenc to conclud that there is scientif consensu about their essenti for the mainten of good health in human the agenc strongli believ that evid of the us of a nutrient for human is necessari befor that nutrient can be allow to be list within the nutrit

properti becaus of the presenc of a substanc when in fact the us of the substanc ha not been establish in human nutrit in addit in it propos rule on mandatori nutrit label 55 fr 29487 at 29493 juli 19 1990 fda state that it wa concern about the possibl of a larg number of nutrient be list in nutrit label and about the wai in which their presenc on the label mai be interpret by consum fda express concern that the presenc of a larg number of nutrient could be misinterpret as impli that a food ha a greater public health signific than mai be the case the potenti for thi happen and mislead the consum about the contribut of the food to human nutrit is especi like if the nutrit label were to includ nutrient not known to be import to human therefor fda believ that food that list such nutrient in the nutrit label would be misbrand under section 403 a of the act which prohibit mislead inform on the label and label of food howev statement about amount and percentag can be made outsid of the nutrit label as discuss in the final rule on nutrient content claim publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist the agenc is specifi that the new nutrient to be list appear in an order that reflect the order that fda propos in the nutrit label propos of novemb 27 1991 56 fr 60390 vitamin k is to be list after vitamin e with the fat solubl vitamin selenium is to be list befor copper and the remain nutrient manganes fluorid chromium molybdenum and chlorid ar to be list after copper at the bottom of the list the agenc point out that it is not allow the list of these nutrient on the nutrit label of food in convent food form under 101 9 c 8 quantit amount by weight of vitamin and miner ar not list within the nutrit label of food in convent food form as a result the list of onli an asterisk in conjunct with the statement daili valu not establish would provid consum with no indic of the amount of chlorid chromium fluorid manganes molybdenum selenium and vitamin k present in the food therefor fda ha not provid in 101 9 for a provis compar to that in 101 36 b 3 and b 4 that allow for the placement of these nutrient on the nutrit label fda wish to point out that 101 36 a onli requir the label of a dietari supplement of a vitamin or miner to bear nutrit label in accord with the provis of 101 36 if the vitamin or miner in the supplement have an rdi or drv accordingli dietari

such as fat and sodium should not be requir to be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner on of these comment said that dietari supplement ar not taken becaus of their fat or sodium level and that these substanc should not be declar other comment specif support the propos rule in requir that nutrient of thi type be declar when thei ar present the agenc is not persuad that nutrient such as fat and sodium should not be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when present in signific amount the major of the comment support fda view that thi inform is need to fulli inform consum of the nutrient content of these product although dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar not consum becaus of their fat or sodium level thi type of inform on product that contain signific level of such nutrient will assist consum in maintain healthi dietari practic therefor the agenc is not make the request chang in the regul 3 a few comment state that dietari supplement of herb and of other nutrit substanc should be label under 101 36 on of these comment said it would be less confus if all supplement were label in the same manner other comment agre that dietari supplement of herb should be label in accord with 101 9 for food in convent food form howev at least on comment request that dietari supplement of herb be exempt from declar the core nutrient if thei have to be label in accord with 101 9 and anoth comment said that these dietari supplement should not have to list percent daili valu at least on comment state that dietari supplement of herb should have their own format for nutrit label and a few other comment request that dietari supplement of herb be exempt from all nutrit label on of these comment agre that fda did not have the author to exempt dietari supplement of herb from 101 9 and want an amend to the 1990 amend that would exempt these dietari supplement from nutrit label thi comment said that dietari supplement of herb ar not normal consum for their nutrit valu and that nutrit label on these product is irrelev and unimport to consum as explain in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33716 june 18 1993 the differ in the label of dietari supplement of vitamin or miner and of dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc is a result of section 403 q 5 f of the act as state abov thi section provid that if a food to which section 411 of the act appli i e a dietari supplement of vitamin or miner contain on or more of the nutrient requir to be list in

the act that would allow the agenc to exempt the broad categori of dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc from section 403 q 1 and q 2 of the act thu supplement that ar not dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar appropri subject to nutrit label under 101 9 under 101 9 the nutrit label of dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc mai be present

dietari supplement of herb us the simplifi format should be exempt from the requir to declar the core nutrient i e calori total fat sodium total carbohydr and protein the agenc ha state it belief in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2142 that thi core inform is essenti to aid consum in learn about the rel nutrit qualiti of all food and the inform allow consum to judg the consequ of the food select thei make no new inform wa present in the comment to chang fda posit on thi issu the agenc also advis that 101 9 j 4 provid that food subject to 101 9 includ dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc ar exempt from nutrit label requir when all of the nutrient requir to be declar under 101 9 c ar absent or ar present in insignific amount fda is also not persuad that nutrit label on supplement of herb should be excus from list percent daili valu as call for in section 2 b 1 a of the 1990 amend a primari purpos of the nutrit label is to help consum make inform food choic by enabl them to both comprehend the nutrit valu of the food and to understand it rel signific in the context of the total daili diet the consum research that the agenc review in the mandatori nutrit label final rule support fda assert that the list of percent daili valu improv consum abil to make correct dietari judgment about a food in the context of a total daili diet 58 fr 2079 at 2125 in part thi improv abil to make judgment is achiev by the us of a consist system of percentag so that virtual all the nutrient on the label can be declar in equival unit also the percentag commun inform about the nutrient level in a food without the consum have to be concern about the absolut level or unit of the underli scale be us therefor for the reason state the agenc ha not acced to the request that dietari supplement of herb and of other similar nutrit substanc be label under 101 36 have their own format for nutrit label be exempt from all nutrit label or be exempt from declar the core nutrient and the percent daili valu in 101 9 4 on comment request that the languag of 101 36 a and 101 9 j 6 be revis to refer to dietari supplement that ar repres as a sourc of vitamin and miner instead of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner thi comment wa concern that alfalfa tablet that have calcium as a binder would be requir to be label under 101 36 the agenc would like to make clear that it doe not consid a product that contain a substanc that is a vitamin or a miner but that is us in the food sole for technolog purpos to be a dietari supplement of a vitamin or

binder would be requir to be label under 101 9 5 a few comment request clarif of the type of nutrit label that would be requir for combin product that contain herb with ad vitamin the agenc advis that the type of nutrit label that would be requir for product that contain herb and ad vitamin would depend upon the content of the product as well as how the product is repres if a combin product is primarili a dietari supplement of vitamin and miner and is market as such the product would have to be label in accord with 101 36 if the product is not primarili a dietari supplement of vitamin or miner and is not repres as such it would have to be label in accord with 101 9 the agenc believ that the manufactur make the determin as to whether a product is primarili a dietari supplement of an herb of vitamin or miner or of a similar nutrit substanc base on how it label and formul the product the type of claim that ar made on a dietari supplement will both determin and be limit by whether

give promin to or emphas ingredi that ar not vitamin miner or repres as a sourc of vitamin or miner thu if for exampl a dietari supplement of an herbal extract add vitamin and miner yet remain primarili a dietari supplement of the herbal extract and is advertis as such section 411 b 2 b of the act would not appli to the product thi would be the case when the label of such a product made no refer to ani ad vitamin or miner other than in the ingredi list and nutrit label section 411 b 2 b is discuss in more detail in the companion document on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement which is publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist 6 on comment request that the languag of 101 36 a be revis to delet and label the comment sai that nutrit label is not requir on label under

instanc the direct mai state take 3 tablet a dai without indic if thei ar to be taken at on set as on serv or spread out throughout the dai in three separ serv thu it is fair to conclud that in mani instanc the serv size will not be duplic addition thi inform quickli inform the consum about the amount of the product that contain the level of nutrient declar it also provid a degre of consist between the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner and those of food in convent food form fda conclud in the mandatori nutrit label final rule that if the nutrit label wa to be

dietari supplement of vitamin and miner and food in convent food form will help consum to find and recogn the inform consist treatment is import for the effect us of the nutrit label by consum as a result the agenc is not chang 101 36 to delet the requir for serv size inform 8 on comment state that the refer amount for dietari supplement should be specifi in absolut term but did not provid ani data the comment argu that absolut amount ar need so that if compar claim ar made on product recommend consumpt of for exampl on tablespoon per dai is not compar to a product recommend five tablespoon per dai a few other comment support the propos definit for refer amount the agenc ha defin the refer amount customarili consum for a dietari supplement in 101 12 b as the maximum amount recommend on

agenc reli upon label recommend in thi definit becaus it believ that consumpt is determin in larg part by the amount recommend on the label of these product and it lack the data to specifi absolut amount the agenc request comment on thi approach in the propos no comment provid data for the agenc to us in determin absolut amount that could be us as refer amount therefor the refer amount for dietari supplement will continu to be base on label recommend the agenc doe not agre with the comment that absolut amount ar need to prevent a product with a 1 tablespoon serv from be compar to a product with a 5 tablespoon serv lack data to the contrari the agenc must assum that the recommend amount on the label is the amount customarili consum base on that assumpt it is consist with 101 13 gener principl for nutrient content claim which provid for compar claim to be base on refer amount customarili consum thi topic as it relat to compar claim is further discuss in the companion document on nutrient content claim for dietari supplement publish elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist 9 a few comment state that the term serv size is confus on dietari supplement a few comment had question about the determin of serv size and on of these comment request that the term recommend intak be us instead of the term serv size anoth comment suggest that the term minimum recommend serv size be us when the label direct specifi a rang of possibl intak for a product e g two to three tablet per dai thi comment wa concern that someon read onli the nutrit inform portion of the label will think that the serv amount list there is the recommend amount when it is realli the maximum recommend amount other comment disagre with thi posit and support the propos rule which state that the serv size should refer to the maximum amount when a rang is specifi for a product on comment ask what the serv size is when the label recommend on to four tablet per dai thi comment also ask about serv size when the label recommend two tablet a dai anoth comment support the statement in the propos that if there is no amount recommend on the label the serv size is on unit of the supplement thi comment observ that the issu aris as to how a determin can be made of serv per contain if there is no recommend as to serv size the comment state that thi issu need to be consid to avoid a regulatori gap the agenc is not persuad that a term other than serv size should be us to describ the basi for nutrient declar for dietari supplement it would be confus for consum if dietari supplement of vitamin and miner us a term such as recommend intak and other food us the term serv size as discuss in the nutrit label propos on dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33716 the agenc propos that the nutrit label of vitamin or miner supplement be present in a manner that is as similar as possibl to the nutrit label of other food the agenc believ that us of the same term on all label will help to avoid confus as us of the new nutrit label becom more widespread and consum becom familiar with it thei will come to understand that the serv size repres the amount of product that thei ar like to consum in on eat occas thu thei will come to understand that for a dietari supplement the serv size repres the amount of that product that thei ar like to consum at those time that thei decid to take the supplement as explain in the propos of june 18 1993 58 fr 33715 at 33716 the agenc believ that it is more us for consum to have the serv size be base on the maximum amount recommend and to have the nutrit inform be report on thi basi than to have serv size be base on the minimum or the averag amount howev in some case the serv size is the same regardless of whether the maximum or minimum amount is us for exampl if label direct recommend a rang of on to three tablet per dai the serv size is on tablet base on the fact that there ar three separ eat occas per dai if label direct recommend a rang of on to four tablet per dai the serv size is also on tablet given the round rule i e four divid by three round off to on as for the question what is the serv size if the label recommend two tablet per dai the serv size would also be on tablet becaus of round in the absenc of recommend on the label a serv size of on unit is appropri for determin the serv size and the serv per contain when the serv is on unit the number of serv per contain would duplic the number of unit declar on the princip displai panel to avoid redund the agenc is provid in 101 36 b 2 as propos that inform on serv per contain need not be provid when the ident inform is state in the net quantiti of content declar howev dietari supplement in liquid or powder form will have to declar serv per contain becaus the net quantiti of content inform will be report in net volum or net weight measur such as fluid ounc or gram g while the serv size will be express in common household measur such as teaspoon in conclus the agenc ha reexamin the propos rule with respect to these comment on serv size and believ that no chang ar need b amount per serv 10 a few comment state that nutrit inform should not be report on the basi of per serv these comment request that the head amount per serv be replac by the term amount per dai or by the term amount per tablet or each tablet contain the agenc doe not agre with the comment that nutrit inform should be report as amount per dai as explain in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33717 the agenc propos in the novemb 27 1991 document 56 fr 60366 at 60383 that nutrit inform be present under the head of per unit but that when label direct specifi that more than on unit be consum dure a dai it also be present under the head of per dai i e dual declar the agenc propos dual declar when more than on unit wa to be consum per dai to more fulli inform consum the agenc receiv a number of comment oppos the dual declar of nutrit inform on supplement some of these comment support declar on the basi of per dai becaus thei believ that it is the total daili amount of nutrient that is import other comment favor a per unit basi becaus some consum mai deviat from the recommend intak or the intak mai be present as a rang in the preambl of the mandatori nutrit label final rule of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2079 at 2168 the agenc state that dual declar mai creat a readabl problem for consum and that in gener a per unit approach wa more us than a per dai approach in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33715 at 33717 howev the agenc took a differ approach it state that it had tent conclud that declar on the basi of per serv is prefer becaus report inform sole on a per unit basi could confus consum when more that on unit is to be consum at on time e g two capsul with each meal the agenc express concern that if consum do not notic or do not understand the head that state per unit thei might assum that the inform is for the amount specifi for consumpt at on time i e per serv particularli becaus inform for food in convent food form is express on a per serv basi furthermor the agenc tent conclud that consist with the label of food in convent food form in thi regard is the best approach becaus it will reduc consum confus 58 fr 33715 at 33717 inasmuch as most of the comment support the propos rule on thi issu and comment oppos did not provid ani inform demonstr that there is enhanc consum understand or eas of us when inform is express on a daili basi the agenc is not chang 101 36 b 3 in respons to these comment fda ha reconsid it posit in respons to comment request us of the term amount per tablet and each tablet contain howev in light of the comment the agenc conclud that where the serv size is on tablet there is littl if ani chanc for misunderstand if either of these term is us in place of the term amount per serv therefor the agenc is revis 101 36 b 3 to state that when the serv size of the product is on unit a head consist with the declar of serv size such as amount per tablet or each tablet contain mai be us in lieu of amount per serv other appropri term such as capsul packet or teaspoon mai be us in place of the term serv while a consist chang in 101 9 d 4 appear reason fda believ that it is necessari to address such a chang through notic and comment rulemak the agenc intend to propos such a chang in the near futur c nutrient inform 1 list of nutrient name and amount 11 sever comment recommend that inform on the quantit amount by weight for the nutrient list should be present in a separ column rather than immedi follow nutrient name these comment state that some consum bui on the basi of amount us them to make product comparison and that separ column would help consum to more readili locat thi inform an addit comment request that inform on amount be present either in a separ column or after the percent daili valu in parenthesi on the other hand sever comment support the propos rule argu that the format for dietari supplement of vitamin or miner should follow the format for food in convent food form the agenc disagre with the recommend that inform on the quantit amount by weight for the nutrient list should be present in a separ column the agenc observ that space on the label is conserv by not requir a separ column furthermor fda believ that the comprehens of thi inform will be enhanc when it is present immedi next to the name of the nutrient as discuss in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2117 multipl column nutrient inform displai ar much more difficult than singl column displai for consum to us for product comparison both fda first experiment format studi and the major industri format studi found that declar nutrient amount per serv in adjac column of gram per milligram g mg amount and percent daili valu led consum to make more mistak and to take longer on the product comparison type of task ref 3 and 4 fda second experiment studi howev show that when g mg nutrient amount inform wa place immedi next to the nutrient name in an unord arrai and percent were place in a column arrai the advers effect on product comparison perform disappear ref 5 thu the agenc is requir in 101 36 b 3 that the name of each nutrient list shall be immedi follow by the quantit amount by weight of the nutrient to be consist with 101 9 d 7 i 12 a few comment request that onli the calcium portion of calcium glucon be list in the nutrit panel and on the princip displai panel similarli anoth comment request that the agenc clarifi that vitamin b6 refer to pyridoxin not pyridoxin hydrochlorid the agenc wish to emphas that the declar of the quantit amount by weight in the nutrit label is to indic the weight of a particular nutrient and not the weight of the salt of that nutrient us to make the supplement for exampl onli the calcium portion of calcium glucon is to be declar in the nutrit label although in some circumst the weight of the whole substanc mai appear on the princip displai panel if it clearli refer to the whole substanc such as when the statement of ident state calcium glucon 600 mg similarli onli the pyridoxin portion of pyridoxin hydrochlorid is to be declar in the nutrit label the agenc believ that no chang in 101 36 ar necessari base on these comment 13 on comment recommend that biotin and folat be declar in term of microgram g not mg and that calcium and phosphoru be declar in term of mg not g the comment state that consum ar more familiar with these nutrient be express in thi manner fda propos on juli 19 1990 56 fr 29476 to chang to the unit suggest in thi comment howev section 203 of the ds act prohibit fda from adopt ani refer valu for vitamin and miner differ from the us rda contain in 101 9 c 7 iv as in effect on octob 6 1992 until after novemb 8 1993 accordingli fda adopt those us rda valu as the rdi with biotin and folat express in term of mg and calcium and phosphoru express in term of g sinc the prohibit in section 203 of the ds act ha now expir the agenc is propos elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist to amend 101 9 to chang the unit of declar for biotin and folat to g and for calcium and phosphoru to mg thi propos respond fulli to the comment 14 on comment wa oppos to the agenc s propos in 101 36 b 3 to allow amount of protein below 1 g to be left off the nutrit label thi comment request that such amount of protein be declar becaus individu who ar highli sensit to monosodium glutam msg mai have advers reaction fda ha recogn that certain individu ar sensit to msg and believ that the appropri mean to convei the presenc of thi ingredi to consum is by us of the ingredi statement becaus msg is a food ingredi the agenc reiter that dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar requir to compli with 101 4 21 cfr 101 4 which requir full ingredi label of food furthermor in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 the agenc propos chang in the regul pertain to ingredi label to accommod those individu who ar sensit to msg propos 101 22 58 fr 2950 would requir that when the amount of free glutam in hydrolyz protein reach a specifi level the declar in the ingredi statement must includ the parenthet contain glutam the agenc ha reexamin propos 101 36 in respons to thi comment and note that there is an inconsist in the label of protein total carbohydr and dietari fiber between 101 9 and propos 101 36 for exampl 0 5 g to 0 99 g of these substanc in a dietari supplement of a vitamin or miner would not be declar under propos 101 36 b 3 yet these amount in a food in convent food form would be declar either as 1 g or less than 1 g under 101 9 c to correct thi inconsist the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 to provid that amount of nutrient that can be declar as zero in the nutrit label of food in convent food form shall not be declar in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner thu the agenc is requir the declar of protein as well as total carbohydr and dietari fiber when thei ar present in amount of 0 5 g to 1 g amount under 0 5 g would continu to not be list in the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner becaus these amount would allow a declar of zero in the nutrit label of food in convent form 15 on comment recommend that activ ingredi present at less than 2 percent of the daili valu be allow to be list in the nutrit label the agenc is not allow vitamin and miner except sodium and potassium which ar not includ in 101 9 c 8 iv present at less than 2 percent of the daili valu to be list becaus the declar of such amount would be mislead such valu ar insignific under 101 9 f and mai be declar as 0 percent of the rdi in the nutrit label of food in convent food form thei ar amount that ar dietet trivial and physiolog inconsequenti in addit fda is concern that some consum will be misl by the mere presenc of name of nutrient within the nutrit label becaus thei would assum that product with more nutrient list have a greater public health signific than those with less regardless of the amount of each nutrient present the agenc is unawar of ani reason nor doe the comment present ani reason for allow the declar of nutrient that ar present in such small amount thu the agenc is make no chang in respons to thi comment 16 on comment request that fda revis 101 36 b 3 i to more clearli state the increment to be us for express the quantit amount by weight of vitamin and miner anoth comment state that amount should not be round thi comment state we realli see no reason why product should not be formul to contain the amount state on the label subject to reason overag base on shelf life consider and the like and reason analyt variat the agenc inadvert did not address the increment to be us for express the quantit amount by weight of vitamin and miner propos 101 36 b 3 i state that amount of vitamin and miner ar to be express in the increment specifi in 101 9 c us the unit of measur and the level of signific given in 101 9 c 8 iv except that zero follow decim point mai be drop while the agenc is adopt thi rule fda recogn that as the comment point out 101 9 c doe not address the question of the increment in which the quantit amount of vitamin and miner ar to be declar becaus in the nutrit label of food in convent food form vitamin and miner ar declar onli as a percentag of the daili valu the quantit amount by weight of these nutrient except for potassium and sodium which ar consid electrolyt ar not requir in the nutrit label of convent food the agenc ha consid thi issu and note that dietari supplement unlik most food in convent food form ar fabric to contain specif amount of vitamin and miner it is for thi reason that the vitamin and miner in dietari supplement ar categor as class i nutrient and that under 101 9 g 4 a food is misbrand if it contain less of an ad vitamin or miner than the amount declar on the label in view of how dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar made the agenc agre that it make no sens to permit the amount of vitamin and miner in such product to be round and declar onli in specifi increment therefor the agenc ha modifi 101 36 b 3 i to provid that the actual amount of vitamin and miner in the supplement ar to be declar us the unit of measur specifi in 101 9 c 8 iv except that zero follow decim point mai be drop with respect to level of signific that is the number of decim place us in declar amount the agenc propos that onli the level of signific shown in 101 9 c 8 iv could be present in some case howev the number of decim place allow is not suffici to express actual amount of certain vitamin and miner becaus the amount ar veri small for exampl a product that contain 10 percent of the daili valu for copper would contain 0 2 mg of copper if the amount of copper had to be express us the same level of signific as that us in 101 9 c 8 iv for express it rdi i e 2 mg the lowest amount that could be declar would be 1 mg which would be inaccur high to ensur that amount of vitamin and miner that have nutrit signific can be declar the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 i to provid that amount shall be express in the increment specifi in 101 9 c except that addit level of signific mai be us when the number of decim place indic is not suffici to express lower amount e g the rdi for copper is given in whole mg but the quantit amount mai be declar in tenth of a mg addition the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 i to describ how amount of the nutrient from na 9th and 10th edit ref 2 and 10 for which rdi have not been establish ar to be declar amount for chlorid fluorid and manganes shall be express in mg and amount for chromium molybdenum selenium and vitamin k shall be express in g these valu shall be express in whole number except that tenth mai be us for fluorid these valu reflect the amount in which the rdi or easddl for these nutrient ar given ref 2 and 10 17 on comment state there wa an appar inconsist between the requir in 101 36 b 3 ii that nutrient be list in the order specifi in 101 9 c except that calcium and iron when present should be group with other miner and the sequenc of vitamin d and vitamin e in the exampl provid in 101 36 c 8 the comment recommend that the appropri order of nutrient be clarifi in the regul while fda find no inconsist with the sequenc of vitamin d and vitamin e in the sampl label provid in 101 36 c 8 the agenc point out that there wa an error in the order of nutrient in 101 9 c 8 iv in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2227 fda publish a correct in the feder regist of april 1 1993 58 fr 17104 which list the order as follow vitamin a vitamin c calcium iron vitamin d vitamin e thiamin riboflavin niacin vitamin b6 folat vitamin b12 biotin pantothen acid phosphoru iodin magnesium zinc and copper thi order is the on us by fda in the june 18 1993 propos on nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner except that calcium and iron were list with the miner follow pantothen acid the agenc wish to make these regul as clear as possibl therefor in respons to the comment s request for clarif of the appropri order of nutrient and to make clear where in the list to includ the nutrient that have no rdi but that ar requir to be includ in the nutrit label on dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when thei ar present fda is revis 101 36 b 3 ii to specifi the exact order in which vitamin and miner ar to be declar see section ii comment 1 of thi document ani nutrient not present in the supplement or present at insignific level must be omit from the list 18 at least on comment request that vitamin be list in alphabet order anoth comment request that calcium and magnesium be the first miner to be list the agenc ha not accept these suggest as discuss in the nutrit label propos for dietari supplement 58 fr 33719 with the except of calcium and iron fda propos in 101 36 b 3 ii that nutrient declar in the nutrit label of vitamin or miner supplement be list in the order that nutrient ar list in the nutrit label of food in convent food form the agenc propos that calcium and iron be list after the list of ani vitamin that ar present so that all of the vitamin will be group togeth while vitamin a and vitamin c ar to be list first consist with 101 9 c thei ar then follow by the fat solubl vitamin then the water solubl vitamin and the miner the na in it rda public ha tradition group the fat solubl vitamin ahead of the water solubl vitamin the agenc note that thi order is follow on the label of mani vitamin supplement in the marketplac the comment request alphabet order gave no convinc justif for follow a differ order and thu fda is not chang the order addition the comment request that calcium and magnesium be the first miner to be list present no reason for the agenc to make thi chang calcium and iron ar requir to be the first miner list on the label of food in convent food form in the absenc of ani reason for why calcium and magnesium should be the first miner to be declar on the label of supplement of vitamin and miner the agenc is make no chang in the order for miner 19 on comment request that 101 36 b 3 ii be revis to requir that potassium be list with the other miner prefer last on the list thi comment and other express confus about whether potassium could be list and request clarif on comment request that 101 36 b 3 be clarifi to allow for the voluntari list of potassium in dietari supplement becaus accord to the comment potassium is usual present at less than 100 mg per tablet primarili becaus of exist fda restrict on potassium salt prepar the agenc agre that the list of potassium need clarif potassium is not requir to be list on the nutrit label of food in convent food form howev it can be list voluntarili and when it is it is to be list under sodium as an electrolyt rather than with the miner in contrast the agenc propos that potassium be requir to be list on the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner when present in supplement at more than insignific amount i e 5 mg and abov consist with the list of other vitamin and miner the agenc know of no reason why potassium in supplement of vitamin and miner should be treat differ from other vitamin and miner in these product and the comment did not provid a reason for why the list of potassium should be voluntari rather than mandatori therefor the agenc is not make thi chang howev the agenc is modifi the languag of 101 36 b 3 to make it clear that the declar of potassium is requir when it is present at more than insignific amount to thi end fda ha revis the second sentenc of 101 36 b 3 to state in addit potassium shall be declar except when present at an amount that allow a declar of zero with respect to the placement of potassium within the nutrit label fda agre with the comment that the regul should be modifi the propos state that nutrient that ar present shall be list in the order specifi in 101 9 c which would mean that potassium as well as sodium would preced the list of ani other vitamin or miner present in a supplement fda ha conclud that it is not appropri and might confus consum to have the declar of potassium as well as that of sodium preced the declar of other vitamin and miner on these label becaus tradition vitamin have appear first the agenc agre with the comment that it is appropri for potassium to be list at the bottom of the list becaus it is an electrolyt and the electrolyt chlorid is list at the bottom for the same reason the agenc conclud that sodium should be list with the other electrolyt accordingli the agenc is revis 101 36 b 3 ii to state that sodium and potassium should be list in that order follow the electrolyt chlorid at the bottom of the list of miner 20 on comment request clarif regard the label to be us on a packag that ha two compart each contain a differ supplement to be taken at the same time three time daili with meal the compani ask if the regul permit the inform for both supplement to be report aggreg in on nutrit label that ha on column of name and amount and on column of percent daili valu the firm request that if an aggreg label is not permit the addit nutrit label be permit in a packag insert the compani also ask how the inform should be present if children on to four year of ag ar to take the same amount as adult and how it is to be present if such children ar to take half the amount of adult the agenc advis that if two supplement ar to be taken at the same time on unit of each three time daili the nutrit inform for both supplement must be report aggreg in thi situat the serv size must clearli state that a serv includ on of each supplement with on column list name and the total quantit amount by weight for both supplement and anoth column contain the total percent daili valu if thi product is also repres for us by children on to four year of ag the percent daili valu for thi ag group would have to be present in a third column in the case where the serv size is differ for children a nutrit label for adult and a separ nutrit label for children must be us to avoid confus 21 a few comment request that the declar of the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten be mandatori these comment argu that thi inform is need to help consum compar the amount of beta caroten in variou product thei state that thi inform would help consum understand claim such as now with beta caroten on of these comment request the voluntari declar of the quantit amount of beta caroten in addit to the percentag of vitamin a present as beta caroten thi comment state that calcul of vitamin a and beta caroten valu ar difficult even for scientist and that mere provid a percentag will not allow consum to readili determin just how much beta caroten is present in the product the comment request that the amount of beta caroten be express in mg two comment request that the percent of vitamin a present as retinol also be mandatori on of these comment explain that most peopl ar better off get their vitamin a from beta caroten rather than from retinol becaus beta caroten is safer in high dose and mai help reduc the risk of certain cancer heart diseas cataract and other health problem fda is not persuad that the declar of the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten should be mandatori becaus quantit recommend about the intak of beta caroten have not yet been establish by the scientif commun in the juli 19 1990 mandatori nutrit label propos 55 fr 29476 at 29493 the agenc set out the factor that it consid in decid whether a nutrient or food compon should be mandatori or voluntari in nutrit label the agenc ha propos to make the declar of a nutrient or food compon mandatori in nutrit label when quantit intak recommend with respect to the nutrient or compon ar highlight in the report e g reduc total fat intak to 30 or less of calori and the nutrient or compon is of particular public health signific as defin in sever recent consensu document on the other hand for those nutrient or food compon for which quantit intak recommend ar not highlight but that do have some public health signific or for which quantit recommend ar avail but that ar not of press public health import e g the recommend dietari allow for sever vitamin and miner the agenc is propos to make declar of the nutrient or compon voluntari 55 fr 29487 at 29493 the agenc conclud that it decis to have the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten be voluntari is consist with these guidelin becaus quantit intak recommend have not been establish on the other hand if a claim about beta caroten is made inform on the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten is need to help consum to understand the claim therefor the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 3 iv to requir declar of the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten when a claim is made about beta caroten the agenc tent conclud that a parallel chang in 101 9 c 8 vi for the label of food in convent food form is appropri the agenc intend to propos thi chang in the near futur the agenc is accept the comment s suggest to provid that when the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten is declar the quantit amount of beta caroten mai also be declar voluntarili the agenc is persuad by the comment that thi inform on the label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner would be us to those individu who ar interest in maintain a certain quantit intak of beta caroten in their diet the agenc note that the comment request that the amount of beta caroten be declar in term of mg howev the agenc is requir that intern unit iu be us in place of mg to be consist with the declar of vitamin a fda find the us of thi ad inform would be reduc if the unit us to quantifi vitamin a and beta caroten level differ accordingli the agenc is amend 101 36 b 3 iv to provid that when the percent of vitamin a present as beta caroten is declar the quantit amount in term of iu mai also be declar e g vitamin a 5000 iu 90 percent 4500 iu as beta caroten the agenc intend to propos a parallel chang in 101 9 c 8 vi as soon as possibl until the agenc doe so the agenc advis that it is unlik that it will take enforc action against food regul under 101 9 that declar beta caroten in a manner consist with 101 36 b 3 iv as long as thei compli with 101 9 in all other respect addition the provis on type size requir for the ad statement on beta caroten in 101 36 c 6 is correct to refer to paragraph b 3 iv instead of to b 3 ii there wa an inadvert error in thi refer in the propos with respect to retinol the agenc conclud that in accord with the guidelin set out abov the declar of retinol should be neither mandatori nor voluntari becaus of the absenc of quantit intak recommend and of public health signific thu the agenc is not chang the propos rule to provid for the inclus of retinol in the nutrit label 22 on comment request that 101 36 b 3 v be revis to permit common synonym instead of onli the synonym specifi thi comment state that allow all synonym would provid peopl with more inform and would ensur that the content of product were in fact comprehens to more peopl the comment mention for exampl that niacin is known by mani as vitamin b3 and vitamin e by the name alpha tocopherol anoth comment express support for restrict the us of synonym to the on allow in the propos rule the agenc is not persuad that the provis on synonym should be revis to permit common synonym instead of onli the synonym specifi the terminolog that the agenc ha recogn is that which is us in na rda tabl ref 2 these includ vitamin c ascorb acid thiamin vitamin b1 riboflavin vitamin b2 folat folacin and calori energi the agenc ha restrict the us of synonym to simplifi nutrit label and to avoid potenti confus among consum the agenc believ that allow the unrestrict us of other synonym will contribut to confus about the nutrient that ar present in the product it will also make product comparison more difficult becaus of the absenc of consist terminolog therefor fda is not make the chang request by the comment 23 at least on comment request that the nutrit label of vitamin with iron for exampl be allow to highlight the list of iron the comment state that such highlight is a us and necessari tool to differenti variou product line the agenc is not persuad that the highlight of iron in the exampl describ in the comment is necessari for consum to differenti between variou product line becaus the name or statement of ident of the product must identifi the product as a multivitamin with iron thi identif is suffici to differenti the product from other multivitamin product as discuss in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2138 fda is not permit highlight of thi type becaus it can be us inconsist in a wai that would be potenti mislead to consum among product with similar nutrit profil some would highlight certain nutrient and other would not consum could not depend on the fact that all label of similar product would look the same and the differ in highlight could undermin the credibl of the inform on the nutrit label and lead to consum confus accordingli the agenc is not provid for the highlight request by the comment 24 a number of comment suggest that the sourc of a vitamin or miner be includ in the nutrit label immedi follow the list of that vitamin or miner in a manner similar to the allow list of beta caroten as a sourc of vitamin a on comment state that thi inform should be list in a separ column entitl sourc on comment request that the sourc inform should at least be option the comment state that if thi suggest is adopt it will be unnecessari to repeat sourc inform in the ingredi statement and on comment request that the regul on ingredi label be revis accordingli the comment said that thi approach would conserv space and more effect commun sourc inform to consum the agenc note that the parenthet list of the sourc of a vitamin or miner in the nutrit label is a common practic by some but not all manufactur in the dietari supplement industri the agenc find howev that the comment submit fail to provid adequ justif and support inform demonstr that adopt on an industri wide basi of thi manner of express nutrit and ingredi inform would result in a nutrit label that is readili observ and comprehens as requir by the act comment have not demonstr that consum will be abl to distinguish and understand the mean of both the nutrit and ingredi inform provid fda ha no mean on which to determin for exampl whether the name of the sourc of the nutrient is inde that and not the chemic name of the nutrient the comment also fail to provid data to demonstr that thi manner of present truli conserv label space especi if addit column ar ad to the nutrit label further if as suggest by on comment sourc inform within the nutrit label were made option the consist of present of inform that ha been a guid principl of the agenc throughout the food label reform effort would be violat accordingli the agenc is not provid for the parenthet list of nutrient sourc within the nutrit label the agenc advis howev that it would be recept to a adequ support petit on thi issu and that it will act expediti on such petit given that elsewher in thi issu of the feder regist the agenc is establish a date of applic of juli 1 1995 for the regul govern nutrit label of dietari supplement if a petit is promptli submit that petit could be act upon befor the date of applic ani petit submit to permit sourc declar within the nutrit label would have to address in detail at least the issu of how the sourc inform is to be consist and clearli express and why thi manner of express is advantag to the consum becaus a primari purpos of the nutrit label is to allow consum to compar the nutrit profil of product at the point of purchas it is imper that there be a high degre of consist in the present of nutrit inform for all dietari supplement fda would also need inform on precis how sourc inform should be express within the nutrit label for exampl how would the sourc inform be express if a singl ingredi e g fish liver oil is a

will be avail in the ingredi statement would sourc declar unnecessarili burden the nutrit label and detract from it primari purpos of provid a nutrient profil of the product would it be more difficult for consum to find the list of the quantit amount by weight of nutrient in the nutrit label when sourc inform is given petit on thi issu would be strengthen by the inclus of consum survei or other similar data show that consum readili observ and comprehend inform present in the manner suggest by the comment as discuss in the mandatori label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2170 dietari supplement of

other filler artifici color flavor binder and excipi as well as the sourc of the vitamin and miner in the dietari supplement thi section of the act provid fda with author to grant exempt from the ingredi list requir but such exempt have not been sought by the dietari supplement industri the agenc advis that the fact that the name of an ingredi appear elsewher on the label is not in and of itself suffici justif to grant such exempt therefor ani petit on thi subject must address the issu of how thi manner of present of the sourc of nutrient continu to fulfil the primari purpos of the ingredi label to adequ inform consum about all ingredi us to make a food includ those that might be of concern becaus of person health reason e g lactos the agenc advis that it current polici as state in the feder regist of august 2 1973 38 fr 20730 and march 16 1979 44 fr 16005 and in subsequ correspond with industri ref 6 and 7 is that the label for dietari supplement of vitamin and miner must contain a list of nutrient and a separ full statement of ingredi except those exempt by section 403 i 2 of the act declar by their common or usual name thi polici is consist with the ingredi declar requir for other type of product therefor for all the reason cite abov fda ha decid not to take the action request by these comment pend receipt and review of petit on thi issu 2 list of percent daili valu 25 the agenc receiv a number of comment that oppos the us of the term percent daili valu and that state that thei prefer to continu to us the term percent us rda the agenc disagre with these comment as explain in the final rule on rdi that publish in the feder regist of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2206 at 2207 and 2208 the agenc ha establish two set of label refer valu i e rdi which were previous the us rda and drv becaus the agenc believ the us of the two term on food label could be confus to consum it establish a singl term daili valu to refer to both the rdi and drv 58 fr 2079 at 2124 the comment did not provid ani new argument or data that were not consid in that rulemak furthermor the agenc advis that it know of no reason why dietari supplement of vitamin and miner should not us the terminolog prescrib for food in gener consist in terminolog will assist consum in maintain healthi dietari practic by facilit their us of the nutrit label to construct a healthi diet that includ both dietari supplement and food in convent food form therefor the agenc is not make ani chang in the regul in respons to these comment 26 on comment request that the agenc elimin the us of the term rdi and us the term drv for both macronutri and micronutri the comment state that it is confus to have more the on term the comment appear to be request new term not onli for the nutrit label of dietari supplement of vitamin and miner but also for the nutrit label of food in convent food form the term rdi and drv were establish in the final rule on rdi 58 fr 2206 as discuss in the propos rule of juli 19 1990 55 fr 29476 at 29479 the distinct between the rdi and drv is necessari for sever reason first the rdi ar base on the rda which ar consid intak level to be achiev howev while some drv ar base on recommend to increas or maintain intak of the particular food compon other drv reflect level that ar limit on intak furthermor mani of the drv must be base on a specif calor intak and unlik the rdi the drv ar not relev for infant and young children final the rdi serv as criteria for us in sever regulatori function such as the applic of the agenc s food fortif polici and the assess of the nutrit equival of imit food the drv do not have such us therefor fda believ that it is appropri to treat rdi and drv as two differ set of refer valu howev the agenc note that both term ar refer to as daili valu on the nutrit label the agenc believ that the us of a singl term on the label will limit consum confus thu the concern articul by the comment is fulli address by fda current regulatori scheme accordingli the agenc is not make the request chang 27 on comment request that product contain 5 to 17 mg of potassium should be allow to state contain less than 1 percent of the daili valu of thi nutrient the comment explain that 17 mg of potassium express to the nearest whole percent come to 0 percent daili valu 3 500 mg divid by 17 which round to zero yet 101 9 c 5 onli allow amount less than 5 mg to be consid as zero as a result the nutrit label of such a product would state 15 mg potassium and 0 percent daili valu the comment express concern that such appar contradictori statement would be confus to consum the comment identifi a concern applic to dietari supplement and food in convent food form name that consum mai find it confus when there is a quantit amount by weight for a nutrient and yet the percent daili valu state 0 percent thi seem conflict can occur with sodium potassium and total carbohydr on label of both supplement and food in convent food form and with some vitamin and miner in dietari supplement when both quantit amount by weight and percent daili valu ar given to avoid ani possibl confus that these appar inconsist declar mai caus the agenc is modifi 101 36 b 4 ii to provid for the declar of less than 1 in the percent of daili valu column when the declar of the quantit amount by weight is greater than zero and the calcul of percent daili valu yield a valu that is less than 1 percent the agenc believ that a parallel chang in 101 9 d 7 ii for food in convent food form is appropri the agenc intend to propos thi chang in the near futur addition the agenc note that consist with 101 9 d 7 ii as modifi in the technic amend 58 fr 44063 at 44077 august 18 1993 it is modifi 101 36 b 4 i to specifi that the percent of daili valu shall be calcul by divid either the amount declar on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient i e befor round by the rdi or drv for the specifi nutrient and multipli by 100 the agenc is make thi chang to provid for consist on the food label between the percent daili valu and the quantit amount by weight the agenc had previous provid onli that the amount declar be us in the calcul 28 on comment request clarif of 101 36 b 4 iii which provid that when a product is repres or purport to be for us by a group other than adult and children older than 4 year of ag the percent daili valu for each group must be present in separ column the comment ask if the label of a product repres for us for the famili would have to includ inform for all of the group for which fda ha establish rdi the agenc believ that it is appropri for the label of a product repres for us for the famili to includ inform for adult and children older than 4 year of ag and for children younger than 4 year of ag becaus famili often includ children in thi ag group inasmuch as there gener would be safeti concern in feed infant supplement intend for us by adult fda also advis that the statement for the famili should be modifi to specif exclud infant if a firm want to includ onli a singl list of rdi valu the agenc doe not believ that thi comment requir ani chang in the languag of the propos rule howev the

larger than all other print size in the nutrit label and unless impract shall be set full width of the nutrit label be revis to us the term nutrit panel instead of nutrit label the comment state that the nutrit label could be interpret to mean the whole label in which case the phrase nutrit fact would have to be the biggest print on the label the agenc is not persuad that thi revis is need in

commonli provid on dietari supplement label to allevi thi space problem a number of comment request that fda allow smaller type size on comment request a minimum type size of 3 0 point and anoth 4 0

would be achiev altern thi comment request that the follow sentenc be ad after the first sentenc of 101 36 d 2 such allow will also be consid where a firm produc an articl that purport to compli with the requir of the offici usp and seek to label it in accord with the requir of the pharmacopeia the comment state that thi new sentenc would allow firm to compli with usp label requir with fda permiss addition thi comment request that the name of product that meet usp qualiti standard be follow by the letter usp both of the comment s suggest chang in 101 36 d would allow for two veri differ form of nutrit label on dietari supplement of vitamin and miner depend upon whether a manufactur chose to follow fda requir which ar gener consist with 101 9 or usp which would list onli usp recogn nutrient in the top box a manufactur s decis to follow the usp approach would result in a nutrit label that wa inconsist with label of other dietari supplement of vitamin and miner with dietari supplement of herb and other similar nutrit substanc and with food in convent food form the comment also appear to request that the determin of whether or not a nutrient should be list in the nutrit label should be base upon it usp statu fda find that it would not be consist with section 2 b 1 a of the 1990 amend to provid the flexibl sought by these comment as discuss in respons to earlier comment the agenc decid in the mandatori nutrit label final rule that if the nutrit label wa to be readili observ and comprehens it must be present in as consist a manner as possibl from label to label thu it wa the agenc s determin that whenev possibl nutrit label requir should ensur a distinct look and order of nutrient to facilit consum recognit and understand of the label and to encourag us of the inform allow two differ nutrit label scheme would make it like that some consum would fail to recogn the nutrit inform or would be too confus to be abl to us it fulli fda ha made the same decis with respect to dietari supplement and thu is not provid the flexibl request howev in regard to the request that the name of ingredi of usp qualiti be allow to indic usp statu the agenc advis that although statement appear outsid of the nutrit label ar beyond the scope of thi final rule it would not object to the us of truth and nonmislead statement regard usp statu elsewher on product label further fda would not object to the us of the usp symbol in the ingredi list to identifi those ingredi that ar usp grade the agenc advis that it will not consid the usp symbol when us in thi wai to constitut interven materi in the ingredi list 40 on comment request that fda recogn usp methodolog thi comment state that 101 36 d 1 requir that dietari supplement compli with 101 9 g 2 which specifi associ of offici analyt chemist aoac test methodolog for nutrient analysi the agenc wish to clarifi that 101 9 g 2 state that when fda determin complianc it will analyz composit sampl by appropri method as given in the offici method of analysi of the aoac intern 15th edit or if no aoac method is avail or appropri by other reliabl and appropri analyt procedur manufactur howev ar free to us whatev methodolog thei believ will give result consist with method us by fda therefor the request chang is unnecessari 41 on comment request that the complianc criteria be revis to allow the actual content of ani vitamin or miner in a dietari supplement to be 90 percent instead of at least 100 percent of the declar valu thi comment state that the propos rule i e 101 36 d 1 which refer to 101 9 g 1 through g 2 requir that product that contain ad vitamin and miner provid at least the amount declar for each nutrient the comment state that consider should be given to the fact that mani dietari supplement while formul to contain at least 100 percent of the declar amount ar design to retain onli at least 90 percent of their declar amount over the shelf life declar on these product the comment attribut thi practic to the fact that usp monograph for sever nutrit product requir a minimum nutrient content of 90 percent of the label declar the agenc is not persuad by thi comment as previous discuss in respons to a similar comment in the mandatori nutrit label final rule 58 fr 2079 at 2171 dietari supplement of vitamin and miner ar fabric product the comment provid no convinc reason for why thei should not be held to the same standard as food in convent food form that ar fortifi or enrich the agenc ha inform usp that anyth less than 100 percent of the valu declar on the label for vitamin and miner product is not accept to fda and that the onli permiss deviat from thi requir would be a deviat that is attribut to the variabl of the analyt method ref 8 the agenc note that contrari to the statement in the comment the gener notic of the usp state that a dosag should be formul to provid 100 percent of the label amount ref 9 the limit in the usp monograph allow for overag of ingredi known to decreas with time for analyt error for manufactur and compound variat and for deterior to an extent consid insignific under practic condit ref 9 42 on comment pertain to small busi the comment state that burden the manufactur with the cost of the nutrit label requir list that a vitamin supplement contain no fat no protein no carbohydr etc would be a useless exercis especi in the case of the market of a singl ingredi substanc the comment request that 101 36 f 1 of the propos rule be revis to either delet the nutrit label requir for small busi or to allow the nutrit label to declar onli those nutrient actual present in the supplement the agenc believ that thi comment misunderstood the propos rule as the comment request the agenc requir nutrit label onli with respect to those substanc actual contain in the supplement manufactur ar not burden with the cost of declar that a vitamin supplement contain no fat no protein or no carbohydr if thei do not onli nutrient present in signific amount ar requir to be declar under 101 36 b 3 therefor the agenc is not chang the regul in respons to thi comment fda note that congress recent pass and the presid sign on august 13 1993 the nutrit label and educ act amend of 1993 pub l 103 80 that modifi the treatment of small busi as a result of thi chang the exempt from nutrit label requir for small busi that ar food manufactur will be base on the number of employe in a firm and the number of unit of each product sold fda expect to publish a propos to amend 101 9 and 101 36 to reflect the new law f misbrand 43 on comment state that 101 9 k 1 through k 6 should not appli to dietari supplement the comment state that 101 9 k 1 is overbroad such that it suppress truth nonmislead speech about the benefici properti of a nutrient supplement product that mai by virtu of the supplement s inher properti not onli be a food but also aid in the prevent cure mitig or treatment of ani diseas thi comment did not focu on why 101 9 k 2 through k 6 should not appli to dietari supplement other comment specif mention that the first sentenc of 101 9 k 5 is vagu confus and contradictori thi sentenc provid that a food shall be deem to be misbrand if it label or label repres suggest or impli that the food ha dietari properti when such properti ar of no signific valu or need in human nutrit these comment suggest that thi sentenc be revis to read a food shall be deem to be misbrand if it label claim or repres that the food ha a signific valu or need in human nutrit when the scientif evid for the claim doe not exist these comment argu that thi chang is necessari becaus signific valu or need in human nutrit is a matter of consum percept thei said that to a small child the need for eat spinach is veri low but to the mother the need for spinach is veri high other comment specif agre that 101 9 k should appli to dietari supplement of vitamin and miner the agenc doe not agre with the comment that 101 9 k 1 through k 6 should not appli to dietari supplement or that 101 9 k 1 suppress truth nonmislead speech the comment did not provid ani basi for the agenc to conclud that thi provis is not applic to dietari supplement or that it suppress truth nonmislead speech in the final rule on nutrit label of januari 6 1993 58 fr 2079 at 2167 the agenc point out that the provis of 101 9 i redesign as k had long been in effect at the time congress draft the 1990 amend while congress did enact provis under the 1990 amend that allow for health claim on food noth in the act or in the legisl histori of the act suggest that congress intend that 101 9 i should be chang nor did the comment present ani persuas argument that 101 9 k 5 of the propos rule should be amend the agenc doe not agre that whether or not a signific valu or need in human nutrit ha been establish is a matter of consum percept the agenc note that the phrase signific valu or need in human nutrit wa promulg and publish in the feder regist of januari 19 1973 38 fr 2125 in that final rule 38 fr 2125 at 2128 the agenc explain that over the year there have been a number of ingredi of product market as nutrient and nutrit supplement that have not been shown to be essenti in human nutrit such as rutin other bioflavonoid para aminobenzo acid and inositol the agenc state that call attent to these ingredi in a manner that impli some nutrit benefit is mislead the agenc conclud that the languag of 101 9 k 5 remain clear and doe not need clarif therefor the agenc is make no chang in 101 9 b in respons to these comment iv other
