LA100490-0206: popbeat unstabl reaction our fault not artist s the wai that on is affect by art depend on the individu rock musician like ozzi osbourn ar no more respons than goeth or shakespear for encourag suicid the artist wa obsess with hell death and satan on of the work that made him famou inspir suicid clergi condemn it local govern ban it and all of thi happen more than 200 year befor ozzi osbourn ever chomp on a bat these dai ozzi s darker preoccup ar be pick apart in a georgia court where he is accus in a civil suit of caus the death of two teen ager who did themselv in after listen to hi song suicid solut see stori on f1 osbourn s heavi metal colleagu and fellow briton juda priest recent mount a success defens against a similar suit in nevada perhap these rocker can take some comfort or at least some bitter satisfact in know that much the same thing happen to johann wolfgang von goeth the german romant poet whose spot on western civil s all time hit parad is quit secur in 1774 goeth publish the suffer of young werther the novel s hero is a sensit extravagantli emot aspir artist who lose the love of hi life to a rival then shoot himself to end hi torment in it dai accord to goeth biograph the book touch off an entertain sensat that sound a bit like the hysteria that todai attend the like of madonna michael jackson and new kid on the block much to goeth s own disgust werther becam a pop phenomenon and a market commod young men throughout germani began wear the blue waistcoat in which goeth had garb hi unfortun hero scene and charact from the novel turn up as decor for knickknack souvenir and household item other writer began churn out their own version of the werther stori and there were copycat suicid like the on recount by goeth biograph richard friedenth in which a werther fan open the book to the death scene invit other to watch then dispatch himself with a pistol if he were write in contemporari america goeth probabl would be defend himself in court for an episod like that or is it just heavi metal singer among all other artist who must answer for the wai in which unstabl peopl react to their song from goeth to ozzi osbourn admittedli quit a qualit leap art gravit toward extrem of feel and experi becaus that is where human behavior becom most vivid and interest those extrem also carri the greatest emot impact but at the point of impact it s no longer the artist but the behold who becom the activ agent how we re affect by a song depend on how we imagin interpret and respond to it if harm come to us from that interact the fault li not in our pop star but in ourselv prosecut osbourn for suicid solut seem particularli unjust far from advoc suicid the song is a sardon portray of a booz addl protagonist for whom the bottl becom an instrument of self destruct solut in the song mean a liquid name whiskei as well as a wai to end a problem it s hard for a ration listen to miss the sarcasm as osbourn sing line like where to hide suicid is the onli wai out it s a descript of a pathet state of mind not an endors of that mind s torment logic the osbourn case like the juda priest trial rest on a claim that the victim fell under the spell of sublimin messag embed in the song if such messag ar there a few million listen have been expos without appar ill effect but what if the plaintiff s lawyer ar right and suicid theme in pop song ar inde danger well look out world becaus the music love mass have been batter quit often with these dark horror mayb those who haven t succumb yet should count themselv lucki or mayb thei should start prune their music collect befor their luck run out if ozzi is a threat all you clint black fan mai want to see a therapist just as a prevent measur to ward off the not so
