FBIS4-9741: cso articl by german duqu first paragraph is el espectador introduct text a glanc at the presidenti econom program is pastrana the same as gaviria doe samper make the differ do conserv and liber have practic ident plan everyon talk about reconvers in their econom polici but gener speak thei have not restructur their idea and program pastrana preserv almost everyth in gaviria s program even the same statist some differ can be found in samper s propos especi becaus of hi emphasi on employ polici and the farm sector although the countri mai be in the same econom situat as it wa four year ago it doe not seem logic that the propos for deal with the problem would be just as ident or at least veri similar to those put forward four year ago it is clear that the countri s statist ar out of date but it is also true that the structur problem ar still here it is sad howev to see thing be treat just the same while at the same time the great chang is trumpet the overal diagnosi inde could be the same a minor with great prosper surround by ever greater opportun and a major with seriou surviv problem and a lack of opportun in thi regard in the spirit of chang that the variou polit campaign ar promot on might hope that for exampl some conserv propos would be markedli differ from those made by the liber and of cours clearli differ from those of a liber govern otherwis we could not talk of chang but of continu on the latter point howev it would be worth consid the possibl appropri in mani case of a liber candid continu the strategi of a liber govern as predecessor and current administr nonetheless in both situat on would expect more ambiti and aggress propos come from the opposit parti sinc the idea is to close the gap between the have and the have not if the central diagnosi is realli true and correct an initi face valu analysi of the featur of gaviria s peac revolut plan compar to pastrana s and samper s current propos clearli reveal that there ar tremend similar among them especi between the first two those of gaviria and pastrana it could be said that pastrana like what gaviria did so much that he want to keep it all practic unchang but it could also be said that gaviria left so mani thing unfinish that pastrana and samper would like to continu them that is not necessarili a bad thing either becaus a highwai should not be left half done or an aqueduct without water simpli becaus of a chang in govern the surpris thing is that some peopl seem to want to copi other program to the letter plain and simpl for exampl in the area of infrastructur pastrana propos rehabilit 1 600 kilomet of railwai gaviria s plan contain the same figur but it is unlik in that sector with ferrovia go full steam ahead that even 10 percent of the network ha manag to be improv pastrana would be right to propos it again if inde noth had been accomplish in that sector except for the payment of huge sum of compens to the trade union anoth exampl pastrana sai he will seek to turn 500 000 hectar into suitabl farmland gaviria propos thi same figur four year ago and if i recal correctli lopez michelsen propos the same thing 16 year ago when he creat the himat for the same purpos it could be argu that pastrana is right for undertak such a project sinc it wa appar too much for the gaviria administr to accomplish in the case of water gaviria contend that 11 million colombian did not have potabl water servic a seriou symptom of poverti or of nbi unsatisfi basic need as it is call now pastrana is concern about the same 11 million peopl s need for thi vital liquid can it be that the countri ha not ad a singl liter of water to it servic in the last four year it would appear that the samper camp or the samper case sure becaus he spent part of the time awai from the gaviria administr ha not been as anesthet or as support of the peac revolut regard the initi we have been comment on in the area of infrastructur thei ar not clear becaus the govern platform ha not been present in it entireti on the other hand it is clear that in the macroeconom sphere samper is interest in make all of the econom machineri revolv around massiv job creation he think that job ar the start point for prosper in ani colombian famili and he ha specif pledg to creat more than 1 million new job mayb thi is the characterist that most distinguish pastrana from gaviria hi emphasi on job with regard to the liber of the economi both pastrana and samper propos that it be consolid but the latter is not as enamor of wholesal import without reciproc in trade relat a kei element in the internation of the economi what thi mean is that colombia would onli bui from those who bui it product someth like the fight that ha alreadi start between the unit state and japan seriou advoc of free trade all of the propos from gaviria to the present have in common idea for industri reconvers export promot job train product competit etc etc in short the usual

some educationalist mr albert shanker of the american feder of teacher and no particular friend of the white hous wa not happi with everi small detail but he gracious describ the packag as a major turn point in the histori of american educ no previou us presid he said had taken such a detail interest in the futur of school educ mr lamar alexand mr bush s eloqu educ secretari can claim most of the credit unlik mani cabinet appointe mr alexand know hi subject as governor of tennesse in the 1980s he wa on of the first state leader to recognis the import of school reform the america 2000 programm bear a strike if unacknowledg resembl to the uk educ reform of the last thatcher govern the thatcher strategi had three main element a new nation curriculum measur to promot competit and parent choic and busi fund school to break the mould of bureaucrat local author school each element is precis mirror in the white hous plan the main differ is that mr bush lack a british prime minist s power the us constitut grant state and local govern primari respons for educ feder educ spend account for onli about 6 per cent of the total school budget with few direct power and littl financi leverag mr bush must reli heavili on hi power of persuas the parallel to the uk nation curriculum is a set of new world standard to be develop in each of five core subject english math scienc histori

parent will be awar if their children s result ar lower than those of student in new york or california or in theori tokyo critic argu that nation test will kill educ divers and inhibit teacher thei sai us children ar alreadi burden with too mani test mr alexand s respons is convinc the new exam will replac rather than add to exist test thei ar intend to be of a higher qualiti than the multipl choic quizz on which most american children ar rear student will be expect to write essai and solv complex mathemat problem as is commonplac in europ and japan teach to the test mai therefor promot better teach final student in differ state mai not need to take the same exam differ test calibr to the same educ standard rather like differ a level exam board in england mai be us for constitut reason the nation test will be voluntari but colleg and employ will be encourag to us them for select purpos presidenti citat will be award to student who do exception well the second main plank in mr bush s strategi mirror uk effort to promot competit between school the thatcher govern pass legisl in 1988 give parent a wider choic of school within local author school were also given the right to opt out of local author control and be fund directli by whitehal mr alexand would love to possess such power i don t know how we ever got into thi situat in america of deni a broad choic of school to parent he sai everyth els in america we choos our car our citi our job where we live eight state have alreadi pass school choic reform but the administr intend to inject momentum into the choic movement by offer about dollar 200m in incent to state and local govern that pass legisl promot competit mr alexand also want to revis the feder govern s dollar 6bn programm for disadvantag and under achiev pupil known as chapter 1 so that feder dollar follow the child to whatev extent state and local polici permit measur to permit greater choic among public school ar like to be grudgingli accept although there is littl evid that thei rais educ standard critic rightli worri that school mai end up select pupil rather than parent select school if that happen the alreadi troubl segreg by race and class caus by distinct black and white residenti district could be exacerb what most alarm critic howev is the suggest that as a result of choic polici public monei might flow to privat and cathol school mr alexand point out that the gi bill subsidis the colleg educ of ex servicemen after the second world war did not stipul that the monei must be spent in the public sector by analog he would like disadvantag children to be abl to spend chapter 1 dollar in privat school oppon sai thi would wreck the financ of alreadi underfund inner citi public school the third main element in the bush

year to between three and seven research and develop r d team drawn from compani univers think tank and other the r d team task will be to re invent the public school the goal is to have at least 535

that have fail to adapt to great social and econom chang in the 20th centuri mr alexand expect the r d team to begin by eras all convent assumpt and constraint about school such as the calendar and schedul the curriculum the class size and the natur of learn materi the onli constraint is that the new school should achiev the standard set in the new nation exam at a cost no greater than that of convent school us ingenu just might produc an educ innov the rest of the world will want to copi mr alexand carefulli describ the reform packag as a nation strategi rather than a feder polici at a cost of onli dollar 690m the programm can hardli be said to be usurp the educ role of the state there ar certainli big omiss the white hous is offer neither new monei nor new idea in the vital area of pre school educ it is do noth to reduc vast dispar in educ spend in rich and poor district it is not even try to shame state into make equal educ opportun a realiti but some of the propos particularli nation exam and research into new school deserv congression and state support the strategi cannot hope to rais educ standard quickli no polici frame in washington could do that but there ar enough
